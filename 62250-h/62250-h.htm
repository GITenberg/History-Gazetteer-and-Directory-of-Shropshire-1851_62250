<h1><a name="pagei"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
i</span>PREFACE.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> presenting the Public with a
popular History and Topography of the County of Salop, with a
Directory of its Inhabitants, the author has to acknowledge his
great obligations to the literary and official gentlemen of the
county, who have so freely furnished his agents with valuable
information, as well as to those who have honoured the publisher
with immediate communications; and also to the numerous
subscribers who have so liberally patronised the work.&nbsp; As
authenticity is the grand desideratum of Topography, all possible
care has been taken to avoid errors.&nbsp; Every Parish,
Township, Village, and Hamlet, with all the principal Residences
and Farm Houses in the county have been visited for the
addresses, and to authenticate the necessary information.&nbsp;
It is, therefore, hoped that the great variety of subjects
compressed within its pages will be found complete and
satisfactory to its numerous patrons, and that the volume will be
found an acquisition either to the library or the office.</p>
<p>The Plan of the Work embraces a General History and
Description of Shropshire, containing the spirit of all that has
been previously written on the subject, extracted from ancient
and modern authors, and from the voluminous Parliamentary Reports
of Public Charities, Population, &amp;c., &amp;c., together with
a variety of Agricultural, Commercial, Statistical, Biographical,
and Topographical Information; and comprehending a Survey of
Antiquities, Roads, Rivers, Railroads, Minerals, Public
Buildings, Charities; together with a Chronology of Remarkable
Events, from the earliest period to the present time.</p>
<p>The Topography of the County commences at page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page132">132</a></span>, with an
Alphabetical Arrangement of the Parishes in their respective
Hundreds, and of the Towns, Townships, and Villages, under their
respective Parishes; shewing the Situation, Extent, and
Population of each Parish, Township, Chapelry, and
Extra-Parochial Liberty; the Owners of the Soil and the Lords of
the Manors; the Nature and Value of the Church <a
name="pageii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ii</span>Livings, with
their Patrons and Incumbents; the Places of Worship, Public
Buildings, Public Charities, and Institutions; Trade and
Commerce; Local Occurrences, and Objects of Interest and
Curiosity, &amp;c.&nbsp; Each Township is followed by the
Addresses of the Gentry, and other principal Residents, with a
Classification of Trades and Professions.&nbsp; The Directories
of Shrewsbury, Oswestry, and other principal places, in addition
to a Classification of Trades and Professions, are accompanied by
an Alphabetical List of Persons, so that the address and
occupation of any individual may be instantly referred to.&nbsp;
The Seats of the Nobility and Gentry are appended to the General
History of the County; and the whole is preceded by a copious
Index of Places, Persons, and Subjects, affording an easy
reference to the page at which every Parish, Township, and Hamlet
is to be found; thus giving to the Volume all the advantages of
an Alphabetical Gazetteer.</p>
<p>The extracts from the voluminous Parliamentary Reports of
Public Charities, we trust will be found a useful and valuable
portion of the publication.&nbsp; The standard works of Owen and
Blakeway, and Phillips, Histories of Shrewsbury, Duke&rsquo;s
Antiquities, Hulbert&rsquo;s History and Gregory&rsquo;s
Gazetteer of the County, as well as various Local Histories and
Guides to the more interesting parts of Shropshire, have been
frequently referred to in the compilation of the historical
notices.&nbsp; The Work is accompanied with a large Coloured
Sheet Map of the County, engraved expressly for this Publication.

<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>GENERAL
HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF SHROPSHIRE.</h2>
<p>SHROPSHIRE is an inland county on the borders of Wales,
bounded on the north by Denbighshire, Cheshire, and a detached
part of Flintshire: on the east by Staffordshire: on the south by
Worcestershire, Herefordshire, and Radnorshire: and on the west
by Montgomery and Denbighshire.&nbsp; In length, from north to
south, it is about forty-five miles, and its extreme breadth
thirty-five.&nbsp; Its circumference is computed at 200 miles;
and it comprises an area of 1,343 square statute miles, and,
consequently, 859,520 acres.&nbsp; The county, in Saxon annals,
is called <i>Scrobbesbyrig</i> and <i>Scrobbescire</i>, and by
Latin authors, <i>Comitates Salopiensis</i>.&nbsp; It is one of
the shires, which, in the time of the Romans, was inhabited by
the Cornavii, whose province comprehended the counties of
Cheshire, Salop, Stafford, Warwickshire, and
Worcestershire.&nbsp; At the census of 1801, the county embraced
a population of 167,639 souls: 1831, 222,800: 1841, 239,048, of
whom 119,355 were males, and 119,693 females.&nbsp; At the same
period, there were 47,208 inhabited houses, 2,086 uninhabited,
and 293 houses building.&nbsp; The number of persons born in the
county in these returns was 203,689: in other counties, 3,240: in
Scotland, 391: in Ireland, 1,199: in the British colonies, 14:
foreigners in the county, 161: not specified where born,
1,144.&nbsp; Of the total population, 55,645 males, and 54,624
females, were under 20 years of age: 12,189 were between sixty
and seventy years of age: 6,006 between seventy and eighty: 1,905
between eighty and ninety: 139 between ninety and one hundred:
and the age of 5 persons exceeded one hundred years.&nbsp; The
total population of the fifteen unions, into which the county of
Shropshire is divided, at the census of 1851, are returned as
containing 245,019 inhabitants, of whom 122,122 were males, and
122,997 females.</p>
<p>Shropshire is divided into the hundreds of Albrighton,
Bradford, Brimstree, Chirbury, Clun, Condover, Ford, Munslow,
Oswestry, Overs, Pimhill, Purslow, Stottesden, and Wenlock
franchise, and contains 224 parishes, and 5 extra-parochial
places.&nbsp; By the recent Reform and Division of
Counties&rsquo; Acts, this county is divided into the northern
and southern divisions, each of which returns two members to
Parliament.&nbsp; The boroughs of Shrewsbury, Bridgnorth, Ludlow,
and Wenlock also return two members each.&nbsp; The expenditure
of the county for the year ending December, 1850, was
&pound;12,156. 17s. 4&frac14;d., of which <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>&pound;3,587.
10s. 2d. was expended on the Gaol and House of Correction;
&pound;2,257. 10s. 7d. in prosecutions; &pound;605. 17s. 5d. on
bridges and roads; &pound;562. 13s. 4d. on the Lunatic Asylum;
coroners, &pound;501. 1s. 2d., and Clerk of the Peace,
&pound;436. 4s. 9d.&nbsp; Judge Blackstone says:&mdash;England
was first divided into counties, hundreds, and tithings by Alfred
the Great, for the protection of property and the execution of
justice.&nbsp; Tithings were so called because ten freeholders
formed one.&nbsp; Ten of these tithings were supposed to form a
hundred or wapentake, from an ancient ceremony, in which the
governor of a hundred met all the aldermen of his district, and
holding up his spear, they all touched it with theirs, in token
of subjection and union to one common interest.&nbsp; An
indifferent number of these wapentakes, or hundreds, form a
county or shire, for the civil government of which a shire-reeve
or sheriff is elected annually.&nbsp; The magistrate above the
hundredry was called the trithingman or lathgrieve, presided over
three, four, or more, hundreds, formed into what was called a
trithing, in some places a lathe, and in others a rape; hence the
lathes of Kent, the rapes of Sussex, the parts of Lincoln, and
trithings or ridings of Yorkshire.&nbsp; The kingdom was divided
into parishes soon after the introduction of Christianity, by
Honorius, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the year 636, and the
boundaries of them, as marked in Doomsday book, agree very nearly
with the present division.&nbsp; The custom, which still
continues, of making the hundreds responsible for the excesses of
a lawless mob, is an appendage of the Saxon system of
tithing.&nbsp; As the extreme ignorance of the age made deeds and
writings very rare, the County or Hundred Court was the place
where the most remarkable civil transactions, were finished, and,
in order to preserve a memorial of them, and prevent all future
disputes, here testaments were promulgated, slaves manumitted,
bargains of sale concluded, and, sometimes, for greater security,
the most considerable of these deeds were inserted in the blank
leaves of the parish Bible, which thus became a kind of register,
too sacred to be falsified.&nbsp; It was not unusual to add to
the deed an imprecation on all such as should be guilty of that
crime.&nbsp; In the County Court or shiremotes, all the
freeholders were assembled twice a year, and received appeals
from the other inferior courts.&nbsp; They there decided all
causes, ecclesiastical as well as civil, and the Bishop, together
with the Alderman or Earl, presided over them.&nbsp; All affairs
were determined without much pleading, formality, or delay, by a
majority of voices, and the Bishop or Alderman had no further
authority than to order among the freeholders.&nbsp; Where
justice was denied during three sessions by the Hundred, and then
by the County Court, there lay an appeal to the King&rsquo;s
Court; but this was not practised on slight occasions.&nbsp;
Two-thirds of the fines levied in these Courts went to the King,
and made no contemptible share of the public revenue.</p>
<p>Historians all agree that the Aborigines of Britain were a
tribe of Gauls, who emigrated from the continent, probably a
thousand years before the Christian era.&nbsp; Previous to the
Roman conquest, the ancient Britons inhabiting the southern parts
of the island had made some little progress towards civilization,
but those in the north were wild and uncultivated, and subsisted
chiefly by hunting and the spontaneous productions of the earth,
wearing for their clothing the skins of animals killed in the
chase, and dwelling in habitations formed of the interwoven
branches of the forest.&nbsp; They were divided into small
nations or tribes.&nbsp; Each state was divided into factions
within itself, and was agitated with emulation towards the
neighbouring states; and while the arts of peace were yet
unknown, wars were their chief occupation, and formed the
principal object of ambition among the people.&nbsp; Their
religion was Druidical, but its origin is not known.&nbsp; Some
assert that the Druids accompanied the Gauls in early ages, and
others that Druidism was first introduced into England by the
Ph&oelig;nicians, who were the first merchants that traded to
this island, and for a considerable time monopolized a profitable
trade in tin and other useful metals.&nbsp; Their government,
(according to Diodorus Siculus, the ancient historian,) though
monarchical, was free, and their religion, which formed one part
of their government, was Druidical.&nbsp; Justice was dispensed,
not under any written code of <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>laws, but on equitable principles; and
on difference of opinion in the assembled congress, appeal was
made to the Arch-Druid, whose decision was final.&nbsp; Their
religious ceremonies were performed in high places and in deep
groves, and consisted in worshipping the God of nature, and
rendering him praise on the yearly accession of the
seasons.&nbsp; The priests possessed great authority among them,
besides ministering at the altar, and directing all religious
duties; they enjoyed an immunity from wars and taxes; they
possessed both the civil and criminal jurisdiction; they decided
all controversies among estates, as well as among private
persons, and whoever refused to submit to their decree, was
exposed to the most severe penalties; the sentence of
excommunication was denounced against him; he was forbidden
access to the sacrifices of public worship; he was debarred all
intercourse with his tribe, even in the common affairs of life;
he was refused the protection of law, and death itself became an
acceptable relief from the misery and infamy to which he was
exposed.</p>
<p>The means by which religion was supported was by voluntary
offerings and tithes, and in this respect we find a similarity
with all nations of antiquity.&nbsp; Despite the corruptions and
philosophical atheism in which the Druidical religion became
involved, candour demands of us that the Druids were in
possession of learning as extensive and more useful than some of
their Christian posterity, who, from the eighth century to the
Reformation, were almost wholly employed in scholastic divinity,
metaphysical or chronological disputes, legends, miracles, and
martyrologies, and Dr. Kennedy informs us that in St.
Patrick&rsquo;s time no fewer than 300 volumes of their books
were burnt, and no doubt the same was practised so long as a
volume could be found.&nbsp; By this destruction a wide chasm has
been made in the historical details of this country.&nbsp; Julius
C&aelig;sar, in his &ldquo;<i>Commentarii de Bello
Gallico</i>,&rdquo; informs us that the Druids inculcated the
doctrine of the immortality and transmigration of the soul, and
discoursed with the &ldquo;Youth about the heavenly bodies, their
motion, the size of the heavens and the earth, the nature of
things, and the influence and power of the immortal
Gods.&rdquo;&nbsp; The misletoe was their chief specific in
medicine, and nothing was held so sacred as the misletoe of the
oak, which, being scarce, was gathered with great ceremony on a
certain day appointed for their general festival.&nbsp; In the
civil government of this ancient people capital offenders were
sentenced to death, and sacrificed in the most solemn
manner.&nbsp; The spoils of war were often devoted to their
divinities on the altars of their temples.&nbsp; At the time of
the Roman invasion the British Druids exerted their utmost zeal
in opposing the usurpation of that foreign power.&nbsp; The
invaders on the other hand fired with equal resentment,
endeavoured to establish their security by the extermination of
the Druidic order, and its priests were sacrificed to this
barbarous policy; many fled to the island of Anglesey, and
afterwards perished in the flames by the orders of Seutonius, and
great numbers were cut off in an unsuccessful revolt of the
Britons, under Queen Boadicea, after which the power and
splendour of the Druids rapidly declined.&nbsp; No species of
superstition was ever more terrible than that of the Druids; no
idolatrous worship ever attained such an ascendant over mankind;
and the Romans after their conquest finding it impossible to
reconcile those notions to the laws and institutions of their
masters, while it maintained its authority, were at last obliged
to abolish it by penal statutes&mdash;a violence which had never
in any other instance been practised by these tolerating
conquerors.</p>
<p>The Britons had long remained in a rude and independent state,
when C&aelig;sar, having overrun all Gaul by his victories, first
cast his eye on this island, and being ambitious of carrying his
arms into a new world then mostly unknown, he took advantage of a
short interval in his continental wars, and made an invasion in
Britain fifty-five years before the birth of Christ.&nbsp; In his
first expedition the Kentish Britons immediately opposed him, and
compelled him to fight in the vicinity of Dover, combating even
amongst the waves with singular courage; and, although
C&aelig;sar, observing his troops to be dispirited by the attacks
of the enemy, ordered up his vessels with his artillery, and
poured from <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>their sides stones, arrows, and missiles; yet the
natives sustained these unusual discharges with unshaken
intrepidity, and the invaders made no impression until the
standard bearer of the 10th legion rushed forward, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Follow me, unless you mean to betray your standard to your
enemies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon which the Roman legions were incited
to that desperate and close battle, which at length forced back
the Britons and secured a landing.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the
neighbourhood then sent a message of peace, but four days
afterwards a tempest dispersing the enemy&rsquo;s fleet they
attacked the Romans afresh.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s invasion in
the ensuing summer was more formidable: it was made with five
well appointed legions, and two thousand cavalry, amounting in
the whole to thirty thousand of the best disciplined troops then
known, and under the ablest commanders.&nbsp; Terrified at the
menacing approach of such a force, the inhabitants retired among
the hills, and C&aelig;sar having effected a landing without
opposition, and chosen a proper place for the security of his
fleet, (supposed to be where the town of Deal, in Kent, now
stands), hastened on to the scene of conflict, and found the
Britons had assembled in great numbers from all parts, who
continued an unequal contest with the Roman legions for several
days, but were at length utterly routed, and great numbers of
them slain, nor did the Britons ever after this engage the Romans
with their united forces.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar then led his army to
the river Thames, towards the territories of Cassivellaunus, the
principal leader of the defeated Britons, on the submission of
whom, and having imposed an annual tribute on the vanquished, and
received the hostages which he demanded, marched back to the sea
shore, and shortly after took his final leave of Britain.&nbsp;
The civil wars which ensued, and which ended in the establishment
of an absolute monarchy at Rome, saved the Britons from that yoke
which was about to be imposed on them, the conquerors having
little force to spare for the preservation of distant conquests;
the Britons were therefore left to themselves, and for nearly a
century after the invasion of C&aelig;sar, enjoyed unmolested
their own civil and religious institutions.&nbsp; In the interval
between the first and second invasion of Britain by the Romans,
the founder of the Christian religion had accomplished his divine
mission, in a province of the Roman empire, but almost without
observation at Rome.&nbsp; In the reign of Claudius the Romans
began to think seriously of reducing the Britons under their
dominion, and Plautius, an able general, sent over <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 43, gained some victories, and made
considerable progress in subduing the inhabitants.&nbsp; Claudius
himself finding matters sufficiently prepared for his reception,
made a journey into Britain, and received the submission of
several British states, among which were the Cantic, Antrebates,
Regni, and Trinobantes, who inhabited the south-east part of the
island.&nbsp; The other Britons under the command of Caractacus
still maintained an obstinate resistance, and the Romans made
little progress against them till Ostorious Scapula was sent
over, in the year 50, to command the armies.&nbsp; This general
rapidly advanced the Roman conquests over the Britons, pierced
into the country of the Silures&mdash;a warlike tribe who
inhabited the banks of the Severn, and fought a great battle with
Caractaeus upon the hill called Caer Caradoc, not far from Clun,
on which are the remains of an ancient fortification still to be
seen.&nbsp; In this battle the British leader artfully availed
himself of his knowledge of the country, and posted himself on a
spot, the approaches and retreats of which were as advantageous
to his own party as they were perplexing to the enemy.&nbsp;
Caractacus running from one part of the camp to another, animated
them by the valorous deeds of their ancestors, and told them that
the work of that day would be the beginning of new liberty or of
eternal slavery.&nbsp; The people received these animated
harangues with loud acclamations, and engaged according to the
solemn rites of their religion, never to yield to weapons or
wounds.&nbsp; Their resolution astonished the Roman general, and
the river which flows at the foot of the hill, together with the
ramparts and steeps, presented to the assailants a formidable and
resolute appearance.&nbsp; The Britons, who had no armour or
helmets to shelter them, were at length thrown into confusion,
and great numbers of them perished by the broad swords and
javelins of the <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>legionaries, who obtained an illustrious victory.&nbsp;
The wife and daughter of Caractacus were taken prisoners, and his
brother submitted to the conqueror.&nbsp; Caractacus threw
himself upon the protection of the Queen of Brigantes, and was
treacherously delivered up to the Romans shortly after.&nbsp; The
fame of Caractacus had reached Rome, and the people were
assembled as to some great sight when the British prisoners
arrived there.&nbsp; First in the procession we are informed came
the king&rsquo;s dependants and retinue, and the trappings and
collars and trophies which he had won in war; next his brothers,
his wife and daughter, and last himself was presented to public
view; his body was mostly naked and painted with figures of
beasts; he wore a chain of iron about his neck, and another about
his middle; the hair on his head hanging down in curled locks
covered his back and shoulders.&nbsp; Caractacus neither by his
looks nor language pleaded for mercy, and when he came before the
Emperor&rsquo;s seat expressed himself in these
terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Had I made that prudent use of my prosperity,
which my rank and fortune would have enabled me to make, I had
come hither rather as a friend, than as a prisoner; nor would you
have disdained the alliance of one descended from illustrious
ancestors, and sovereign over many nations.&nbsp; My present
condition, disgraceful as it is to myself, reflects glory on
you.&nbsp; Possessed as I once was of horses, men, arms, and
wealth, what wonder is it if I parted from them with
reluctance.&nbsp; Had I sooner been betrayed, I had neither been
distinguished by misfortune nor you by glory.&nbsp; But if you
now save my life I shall be an eternal monument of your
clemency.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Emperor generously granted the pardon
of Caractacus, his wife, and brothers, who remained at Rome in
the highest esteem.&nbsp; At this time Christianity was preached
in the imperial city, and Brennus with others of his family
became Christians.&nbsp; At the expiration of seven years they
were permitted to return, and were thus furnished with a
favourable opportunity of introducing the Gospel into their own
country, and were instrumental in reclaiming many of the Britons
from their ancient superstitions.&nbsp; It does not appear that
Caractacus was converted to Christianity at Rome, but his son
Cyllin, and his daughter Eigen, are both ranked among the British
saints.&nbsp; Eigen bestowed her hand on a British chieftain, and
Claudia, one of her sisters, is supposed to have become the wife
of Pudens, a Roman senator.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the misfortunes that befel Caractacus, the
Britons were not subdued; and this island was regarded by the
ambitious Romans as a field in which military honor might still
be acquired.&nbsp; During the reign of Nero, Suetonius Paulinus
was invested with the command, and prepared to signalise his name
by victories over these barbarians.&nbsp; Finding that the island
of Mona, (now Anglesey), was the chief seat of the Druids, he
resolved to attack it, and to subject a place which was the
centre of superstition, and which afforded protection to all
their baffled forces.&nbsp; The Britons endeavoured to obstruct
his landing on this sacred island, both by the force of arms and
the terrors of their religion.&nbsp; The women and priests were
intermingled with the soldiers upon the shore, and running about
with flaming torches in their hands, and tossing their
dishevelled hair; they struck greater terror into the astonished
Romans by their howlings, cries, and execrations, than the real
danger from the armed forces.&nbsp; But Suetonius exhorting his
troops to contemn a superstition which they despised, impelled
them to the attack, drove the Britons off the field, burned the
Druids in the same fires which they had prepared for their
captive enemies, destroyed all the consecrated groves and altars,
and, having thus triumphed over the religion of the Britons, he
thought his future progress would be easy in reducing the people
to subjection.</p>
<p>The Britons, taking advantage of the absence of Suetonius,
were shortly after in arms, headed by Boadicea, the Queen of the
Iceni, who had been treated in the most ignominious manner by the
Roman tribunes, and had already attacked with success several
settlements of their insulting conquerors; the Romans, and all
strangers, to the number of 70,000, resident in London, are said
to have been massacred: thus determined were the British to cut
off all hopes of peace or compromise with the enemy.&nbsp; But
this cruelty was revenged by <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Suetonius, in a great and decisive
battle, where 80,000 Britons perished, and Boadicea herself,
rather than fall into the hands of the enraged victor, put an end
to her own life by poison.&nbsp; But the dominion of the Romans
was not finally established till <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 80, when the Roman legions were
placed under the command of Julius Agricola.&nbsp; This
celebrated commander formed a regular plan of subduing Britain,
and rendering the acquisition useful to the conquerors.&nbsp; He
carried his victorious arms northward, defeated the Britons in
every encounter, pierced into the forests and mountains of
Caledonia, reduced everything to subjection in the southern parts
of the island and chased before him all the men of fiercer and
more intractable spirits, who deemed war and death itself less
tolerable than servitude under the victors.&nbsp; Agricola
endeavoured to secure his conquest by erecting a chain of forts
across the isthmus between the Frith of Forth and the Clyde, and
in the year 84 he extended a chain of stations from Solway Frith
to Tynemouth.&nbsp; He introduced laws and civilization among the
Britons, taught them to desire and raise all the conveniences of
life, reconciled them to the Roman language and manners,
instructed them in letters and science, and employed every
expedient to render those chains which he had forged both easy
and agreeable to them.&nbsp; The inhabitants having experienced
how unequal their own force was to resist that of the Romans,
acquiesced in the dominion of their masters, and were gradually
incorporated as a part of that mighty empire.&nbsp; The chain of
stations erected by Agricola was afterwards connected by an
earthen rampart, raised by the Emperor Adrian as an obstruction
to the Caledonians, who frequently descended and committed the
most dreadful ravages in the Roman territories.</p>
<p>The early commerce of the ancient Britons was carried on by
barter, without the aid of money, but about the commencement of
the Christian era a mint master was invited over to Britain from
the continent.&nbsp; A mint was erected at Colchester, and money
of gold, silver and copper was coined in that city; about forty
different specimens have reached our times.&nbsp; Mines both of
silver and gold were worked in the island during the reigns of
Augustus and Trajan.&nbsp; The Romans drew their revenues from
various sources; commerce, mines, legacies, houses, and lands all
contributed to supply their exactions; and as they had suggested
to the natives the mode of making money, they did not fail to
supply the exhausted treasury of Rome from the industry of
Britain.&nbsp; A succession of ages had almost identified the
Britains with the Roman conquerors; and when the Emperors,
pressed by difficulties at home, and weakened by their
possessions abroad, began to withdraw their legions from this
island, the inhabitants importuned them to remain, to protect
them from the incursions of the Picts and Scots.&nbsp; The wall
of Severus was no longer a barrier to these
semi-barbarians.&nbsp; During the residence of the Romans in this
island, comprehending a period of 400 years, many great public
works were accomplished, and they left behind them numerous
monuments of their skill and industry.&nbsp; The conquered
country was divided into six provinces, each of them governed by
a pr&aelig;tor and pr&aelig;stor, the former charged with the
general administration of government, and the latter with the
management of finances.</p>
<p>In the year 450, two years after the last Roman legion had
quitted England, Hengist and Horsa, two brothers, reputed
descendants in the fourth generation from Wodin, one of the
principal gods of the Saxons, embarked their army, to the number
of 1,600, on board three vessels, and landing in the Isle of
Thanet, immediately marched to the defence of the Britons, who
had invited them over to protect them against their northern
invaders.&nbsp; Having expelled the enemy, the fertility and
richness of the country presented a temptation too strong to be
resisted by the ambition of these newly acquired friends, who
soon began to aspire to the possession of the island.&nbsp; The
Saxons of Germany soon after reinforced Hengist and Horsa with
5,000 men, who came over in seventeen vessels.&nbsp; Roused by
this display of treachery, the native inhabitants flew to arms,
and fought many battles under Vortimer with their enemies; the
victories, however, in these actions are disputed by the British
and Saxon annalist, but the progress made by the Saxons proves <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>that the
advantage was commonly on their side.&nbsp; It was about the year
455 the Hengists aiming at an independent sovereignty in Britain,
began the conquest of the territory, and a series of battles
ensued between Hengist and Horsa on the one side, and Vortimer
and Catigern, two sons of Vortigern, on the other.&nbsp; The
battle of Aylesford is memorable for the death of Horsa on the
side of the Saxons, and of Catigern on that of the Britons.&nbsp;
But Hengist, continually reinforced by fresh numbers from
Germany, carried devastation into the most remote corners of
Britain; and being chiefly anxious to spread the terrors of his
arms, he spared neither age, sex, nor condition, wherever he
marched with his victorious forces.&nbsp; The private and public
edifices of the Britons were reduced to ashes, the priests were
slaughtered on the altars; others deserted their native country
and took shelter in Armorica, where, being charitably received by
a people of the same language and manners, they settled in great
numbers, and gave the country the name of Brittany.</p>
<p>King Arthur, in the year 518, almost expelled the Saxons from
the island; but after the death of this monarch, the Saxons again
prevailed under various leaders, and the island was divided into
seven kingdoms.&nbsp; Thus was established the Heptarchy,
Shropshire being included in the kingdom of Mercia, which reached
from London to the Mersey.&nbsp; In the kingdoms of the
Heptarchy, an exact rule of succession was either unknown or not
strictly observed, and thence the reigning prince was continually
agitated with jealousy against all the princes of the blood, whom
he still considered as rivals, and whose death alone could give
him entire security in his possession of the throne.&nbsp; From
this fatal cause, together with the admiration of the monastic
life, and the opinion of merit attending the preservation of
chastity, even in a married state, the royal families had been
entirely extinguished in all the kingdoms except that of Wessex;
and Egbert was the sole descendant of those first conquerors who
subdued Britain, and who enhanced their authority by claiming a
pedigree from Woden, the supreme divinity of their
ancestors.&nbsp; The Mercians, before the accession of Egbert,
had very nearly attained the absolute sovereignty over the
Heptarchy.&nbsp; He had reduced the East Angles under subjection,
and established tributary princes in the kingdoms of Kent and
Essex.&nbsp; Northumberland was involved in anarchy, and no state
of any consequence remained but that of Wessex, which, being much
inferior in extent to Mercia, was supported by the great
qualities alone of its sovereign.&nbsp; Egbert led his army
against the invaders, obtained a complete victory, and, by the
slaughter executed on them in their flight, gave a mortal blow to
the power of the Mercians.&nbsp; Egbert, however, allowed Mercia,
East Anglia, and Northumberland the power of electing a King, who
paid him tribute, and was dependent on him.&nbsp; Thus were
united all the kingdoms of the Heptarchy, in the year 823, in one
great state, near 400 years after the first arrival of the Saxons
in Britain.&nbsp; The fortunate arms and prudent policy of Egbert
at last effected what had been so often attempted in vain, by
other princes.&nbsp; Union in the government gave the people
hopes of settled tranquillity, but these fair expectations were
speedily blasted by the re-appearance of the Danes, who for some
ages had kept the Anglo-Saxons in a state of perpetual
alarm.&nbsp; For upwards of forty years, and through five
successive reigns, the Danes continued the struggle, and, at the
death of Etheldred, his brother Alfred, the successor to the
throne, was obliged to abandon the field, and seek an asylum as a
swine-herd.&nbsp; Emerging afterwards from his retreat, he
expelled the invaders, and contributed essentially to lay the
foundations of those institutions on which the glorious
superstructure of English liberty, was finally erected.&nbsp;
Alfred soon perceived that an army without a maritime force, must
ever be at the mercy of every piratical plunderer, determined to
store his ports with shipping; and vessels larger than those in
use in the surrounding nations were built, many of which carried
sixty oars.&nbsp; The unremitting attention of this illustrious
prince to the navy, contributed to increase the blessings of his
reign, and has obtained for him the title of &ldquo;Father of the
British Navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Of the
Saxon system of government it may be observed, that it had in it
the germ of freedom, if it did not always exhibit the
fruit.&nbsp; In religion they were idolators, and their idols,
altars, and temples, soon overspread the country.&nbsp; They had
a god for every day of the week.&nbsp; <i>Thor</i>, the God of
thunder, represented Thursday; <i>Woden</i>, the God of battle,
represented Wednesday; <i>Friga</i>, the God of love, presided
over Friday; <i>Seater</i>, the God of Saturday, had influence
over the fruits of the earth; <i>Tuyse</i>, the God of the Dutch,
conferred his name on Tuesday; they also worshipped the sun and
the moon, each conferring a name on one of the days of the week;
<i>Sunnan</i>, on Sunday; and <i>Monan</i>, on Monday.&nbsp; The
merit of eradicating this baneful superstition, by the
introduction of Christianity, was reserved for a Roman
Pontiff.&nbsp; Gregory, surnamed the Great, who, in the year 597,
sent Augustine, a monk, into the south, and Paulinus into the
north of England, by whose preaching the Christian religion made
such rapid progress, that it soon became the prevailing faith,
and Augustine was elevated to the Archbishopric of Canterbury,
and Paulinus was made Archbishop of York.&nbsp; He was the first
to preach Christianity in Mercia, where he followed the
victorious arms of Edwin, King of Northumbria.</p>
<p>The greater part of this country was inhabited by the Cornavii
and Ordovices, the first of which occupied the eastern side of
the Severn, whose capital was Uriconium, now Wroxeter, and the
latter were confined to the western side of the Severn.&nbsp;
Though the troops of the Cornavii were registered in the
declension of the empire, it is supposed that they submitted to
the Roman yoke upon easier terms than their neighbours, who held
out some time ere their liberty was wrested from them.&nbsp; The
Romans allotted one side of the Severn, eastward, to Britannia
Prima, and the western side to Britannia Secunda.&nbsp; The
Saxons made Watling street, that runs through the middle of the
county, the boundary between them and the Danes, but when the
compact with the Danes was broken, it returned to the former
division of England and Wales.&nbsp; After the Romans had
abandoned the Island, part of Shropshire was included in the
kingdom of Powis, which comprised portions of the counties of
Chester, Flint, Denbigh, Radnor, and Brecon, and the whole of
Montgomeryshire, of which Pengwern (Shrewsbury) was the
capital.&nbsp; For near two centuries this section of Powisland
was the theatre of frequent and sanguinary contests between the
Britons and the Saxons; it was finally subdued and incorporated
with Mercia, the most powerful of the seven kingdoms forming the
Saxon Heptarchy.&nbsp; When the Danes invaded this island, and,
by their formidable incursions, seemed to threaten its total
subjection, this part of the kingdom of Mercia, though it
suffered less than others, came in for a share of the general
calamity, and its chief city, Uriconium, was destroyed.&nbsp;
About the year 777, the seat of the Prince of Powis was removed
from Pengwern to Mantraval, in Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; The
Britons, who had made incursions into Mercia, were forced not
only to abandon all their conquests there, but also that part of
their country which lay between the Severn and <span
class="smcap">Offa&rsquo;s Dyke</span>, which that King threw up
as a new boundary between them and Mercia, instead of Severn,
their former boundary.&nbsp; The Britons had made their
incursions into Offa&rsquo;s territories, while he was employed
in subduing the Saxon kings, and having no opposition, they were
very successful, till at length Offa, being obliged to conclude a
peace with the English, that he might dispossess them of their
new acquisitions, in which he proved so successful as to force
their retreat, and to prevent their ever returning, threw up the
before-mentioned ditch.&nbsp; This ditch extended from the river
Wye along the counties of Hereford and Radnor, to
Montgomeryshire, and thence near the road between Bishop&rsquo;s
Castle and Newtown.&nbsp; It then passed by Mellington Hall,
where there is an encampment, and on to Leighton Hall, not far
from which it is lost for upwards of five miles, the channel of
the Severn probably serving for that space, as a continuation of
the boundary.&nbsp; It is again seen at Llandysilio and
Llanymynech, from whence it runs to Tref-y-clawdd, and below the
race course, at Oswestry.&nbsp; It then passes above Selattyn,
whence it descends to the Ceriog, and goes by Chirk <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Castle, and
crosses the Dee and Rhuabon road, near Plas Madoc, and being
continued through Flintshire, ends a little below Holywell.&nbsp;
Offa, after having carried his arms over most parts of
Flintshire, and vainly imagined that his labours would restrain
the Cambrian inroads, and prevent incursions beyond the limits
which he had decreed to be the boundaries of his conquests.&nbsp;
It is observable, says Pennant, that in all parts the ditch is on
the Welsh side, and that there are numbers of small artificial
mounds, the sites of small forts along its course.&nbsp; These
were garrisoned, and seem intended for the same purpose as the
towers in the famous Chinese wall, to watch the motions of their
neighbours, and to repel hostile incursions.&nbsp; The folly of
this great work appeared on the death of Offa, for the Welsh,
with irresistible fury, carried their ravages far and wide in the
English marshes.&nbsp; Harold made an ordinance that all Welshmen
found beyond Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, within the English pale, with a
weapon about him, was to have his right hand cut off by the
King&rsquo;s officers.</p>
<p>In the year 1013, Seneyn, King of Denmark, landed with an army
in this country to revenge a cruel massacre of the Danes, which
had taken place a short time before; having brought his fleet up
the Trent to Gainsborough, and landed his forces, it created such
a terror that the whole kingdom was soon brought under his yoke;
he, however, did not long enjoy his success, for he died the
following year, and was succeeded by his son Canute, between whom
and Edmund, the Saxon, several sanguinary engagements took place,
and the kingdom was for a short time divided.&nbsp; In 1041,
Edward the Confessor was by the unanimous voice of the people
raised to the throne; having reigned twenty-five years he died,
and with him ended both the Saxon and Danish rule in this
kingdom.&nbsp; Harold, the son of Godwin, was the next to take
possession of the throne, but he was opposed by his brother
Tosti, who formed a confederacy with Harfrager, King of Norway;
he entered the Humber with a considerable force, and landed his
troops in Yorkshire, where, in a deadly conflict, they were
completely overthrown by Harold, who left his brother and
Harfrager among the slain.&nbsp; Harold having retired to York to
rejoice over his victory, received information that William Duke
of Normandy had landed with a numerous and warlike army at
Ravensey, in Sussex, to meet this unexpected foe.&nbsp; Harold
immediately marched his forces to Hastings, where in an
unsuccessful battle he lost his life.&nbsp; William the Conqueror
had no sooner taken possession of the throne, than he set up
various claims to his new possessions, but his principal right
was that of conquest, and if his sword had not been stronger than
his titles, so many English estates would not have been placed at
his disposal.&nbsp; William brought in his train a large body of
Norman adventurers, and the roll of Battle Abbey, given by Ralph
Holinshead, contains the names of 629 Normans, who all became
claimants upon the fair territory of Britain, and the Saxon lords
were forced to resign their possessions.&nbsp; The landed
property in this county was chiefly given to Roger de Montgomery,
his kinsman, whom he created Earl of Shrewsbury, and of him, it
was mostly held by knights&rsquo; service; to William Pantulf he
granted 29 lordships, of which Wem was the principal, and he
therefore made it the head of his barony.&nbsp; Ralph de Mortimer
had fifty manors, of which nineteen were held under Roger de
Montgomery; Roger Lacy had 23 manors: Roger Fitz Corbet 24
manors; Osborne Fitz Richard nine; and Guarine de Meez one
manor.</p>
<p>After so great an agitation as that produced by the conquest,
some years were necessary to restore a calm.&nbsp; A violent
struggle was made to expel the Normans, and York was the rallying
point of the patriot army.&nbsp; To suppress this formidable
insurrection, William the Conqueror repaired in person into the
north at the head of a powerful army, swearing by the
&ldquo;splendour of God,&rdquo; his usual oath, that not a soul
of his enemies should be left alive.&nbsp; According to William
of Malmesbury, confirmed by others, the whole of the country was
laid waste from the Humber to the Tees, and for nine years
neither spade nor plough was put in the ground, which was the
reason why <i>vasta</i> so often occurs in Doomsday book.&nbsp;
Knowing the detestation in which he was held, the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Norman
Bastard, as historians designate him, entertained a constant
jealousy of the English, and he obliged them every night at eight
o&rsquo;clock to extinguish their fires and candles at the toll
of a bell which obtained the name of &ldquo;Curfew.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Having by these sanguinary atrocities reduced the country to
repose, the Conqueror, in 1080, caused a survey to be taken of
all the lands in the kingdom, on the model of the book at
Winchester, compiled by order of Alfred the Great.&nbsp; This
survey was registered in the national record called the
<i>Doomsday Book</i>, in which is the extent of the land in each
district, the state it was in, whether meadow, pasture, wood, or
arable, the name of the proprietor, the tenure by which it was
held, and the value at which it was estimated, were all duly
entered.&nbsp; In order to make this document complete, and its
authority perpetual, commissioners were appointed to superintend
the survey, and the returns were made under the sanction of
juries of all orders of freemen in each district.&nbsp; After a
labour of six years the business was accomplished, and this
important document, the best memorial of the Conqueror, written
in Roman, with a mixture of Saxon, is still preserved in the
Chapter House, Westminster.&nbsp; For many years Doomsday Book
remained unprinted, but in the 40th of the reign of George III.
his Majesty, by the recommendation of Parliament, and with a
proper regard to public interest, directed that it should be
printed for the use of the Members of Parliament, and also be
deposited in all the public libraries in the kingdom.&nbsp; The
counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham,
are not described in Doomsday Book, probably owing to the
desolation in which they were at that time involved.&nbsp;
Through all ages this &ldquo;book of judicial verdict&rdquo; will
be held in estimation, not only for its antiquity, but also for
its intrinsic value.&nbsp; At the time it was completed, it
afforded the king an exact knowledge of his own land and revenue;
while the rights of his subjects in all disputed cases were
settled by it; and to the present day, it serves to show what
manor is, and what is not ancient demesne.</p>
<p>As the various parish histories of this county contains
frequent extracts from this document, it may be necessary to
explain the land measures and other obsolete feudal terms used at
the time to which it refers.&nbsp; A <i>perch</i>, five yards and
a half; an <i>acre</i>, 160 square perches; an <i>ox gauge</i>,
or <i>bovate</i>, as much as an ox can till, or 28 acres; a
<i>virgate or yard of land</i>, 40 acres; a <i>carucate</i>,
<i>carve</i>, or <i>plough land</i>, generally eight ox gangs; a
<i>hide</i>, as much as one plough would cultivate in one year; a
<i>knight&rsquo;s fee</i>, five hides, or 200 acres of land;
<i>berewicks</i> are manors within manors; <i>merchet</i>, or
<i>maiden&rsquo;s rent</i>, a fine anciently paid by inferior
tenants for the liberty to dispose of their daughters in
marriage; a <i>heriot</i>, a fine paid to the lord on the death
of a landholder; <i>tol</i>, a tribute for liberty to buy and
sell; <i>theane</i>, a liberty to a lord of a manor for judging
bondmen and villeins in his own court; <i>infangtheof</i>, a
privilege of certain lords of manors to pass judgment of theft,
committed by the servants within their district; <i>thelonia</i>,
a writ lying for one who has the king&rsquo;s demesne in fee-farm
to recover reasonable toll; <i>sockmen</i>, tenants who hold by
servile tenure; <i>borderers</i>, cottagers; <i>villein</i>, a
member belonging to a manor.&nbsp; In the time of the Conqueror
<i>Earls</i> began to be <i>feudal</i>, <i>hereditary</i> and
<i>patrimonial</i>; and these, as appear by Doomsday, were styled
simple Earls, as Earl Hugh, Earl Roger, &amp;c.&nbsp; Afterwards
Earls were created with an addition of the name of the place over
which they had jurisdiction, or of the principal seat where they
resided; and they had, as had been customary, the <i>third
penny</i> from the county where they resided for their
support.&nbsp; Soon after the conquest they began to be created
by charter, without any ceremony further than the delivery of
it.&nbsp; King John is the first mentioned who used the girding
of the sword, by which they were said to be invested with this
honour.&nbsp; Thereupon the Sheriff had command to make livery
unto them the third penny of the plea of the county, after which
the Earl had a certain sum only allowed him out of the profits of
his county, as expressed in the patent for his better support and
dignity, and sometimes great possessions were given in lands for
the same purpose.</p>
<p>In the reign of William III., Hugh de Montgomery, second son
of Earl Roger, and who <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>succeeded him in the Earldom of
Shrewsbury, with the Earl of Chester and Owen, a Welsh Lord, made
an unexpected attack upon Wales, and committed great atrocities
upon the inhabitants.&nbsp; Many of the Welsh fled into Ireland,
and left their country to the mercy of the English.&nbsp; Their
flight gave their enemies an opportunity of continuing their
march, and they penetrated into Anglesey, where they destroyed
all before them with fire and sword.&nbsp; While they were thus
exercising their cruelties, Magnus, King of Norway, who had
lately made himself master of the Isle of Man, advanced as far as
Anglesey.&nbsp; On the English endeavouring to hinder him, the
Earl of Shrewsbury was slain in the skirmish.&nbsp; His death was
looked upon as a just judgment for the cruelties committed by him
in that isle.&nbsp; The Earl&rsquo;s death caused some disorder
among the English troops, and constrained them to abandon the
shore; when Magnus landed, and finding the English had left
nothing to plunder, he shortly after re-embarked.&nbsp; Earl
Roger, who succeeded his brother Hugh in the Earldom of
Shrewsbury, being of a rash and discontented spirit, was among
those who favoured the claims of Duke Robert, in place of Henry
I.&nbsp; On the accession of Henry I. he rebelled, and fortified
his castles in Shropshire, and at Shrewsbury built and fortified
a flank wall from each side of the castle, across the isthmus,
down to the Severn side; hereupon the king declared him a
traitor, and marched with a considerable force against him.&nbsp;
The earl perceiving that he had no forces to withstand the attack
of the king, confessed his treason, and was shortly after
banished to Normandy; but again appearing in arms, he was taken
prisoner, and ended a miserable life in close confinement at
Wareham.&nbsp; About this period the king sent several of his
council to Shrewsbury, among whom were Richard de Belmarsh,
bishop of London, warden of the Marches, and governor of the
county of Salop, and others, to meet there Jorweth ap Blithyn, on
pretence of consulting with him about the king&rsquo;s affairs;
but when he came there, contrary to all equity, he was condemned
for treason and committed to prison.&nbsp; The Marches of Wales
are supposed to have been settled by the Saxons, to prevent the
incursions of the Welsh.&nbsp; The Lords of the Marches claimed
to provide silver spears, and support the canopy of purple silk
at the coronation of Queen Eleanor, consort of King Henry
III.&nbsp; The court of the Lord&rsquo;s Marches was held at
Ludlow, and the jurisdiction extended from Chester to
Bristol.&nbsp; All the country between Offa&rsquo;s Dyke and
England was called the Marches, the Lords of which had the power
of life and death in their respective courts.&nbsp; In every
frontier manor a gallows was erected, and if any Welshmen came
over the boundary they were taken up and hanged; and if any
Englishman was caught on the Welsh side, he suffered the same
fate.&nbsp; The houses were frequently moated round, and
palisades set round the edge of the moat, into which place the
inhabitants every night drove their cattle for better
security.&nbsp; If a Welshman got a cow or a horse over the bar
he cried out &ldquo;my own,&rdquo; and any person pursuing them
further would be at the risk of his life.&nbsp; After the death
of the Earl of Macclesfield, the last lord president, the court
was dissolved.&nbsp; Shropshire being the frontier between
England and Wales, had more castles in it than any other county
in England; on the west side they stood so thick, says Dr.
Fuller, &ldquo;that it might seem divided from Wales with a wall
of continued castles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Speed tells us, &ldquo;that
besides several towns strongly walled, there were two and thirty
castles in this shire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the year 1233, Richard, Earl of Pembroke, and several other
noblemen, being disgusted with the conduct of the King, broke out
into open rebellion, and taking advantage of the animosities
subsisting between the English and the Welsh, fled into Wales and
joined Llewellyn, Prince of Wales.&nbsp; Having collected an
army, they laid waste all the Marches between Wales and
Shrewsbury, which town they plundered and put the inhabitants to
the sword.&nbsp; The King being then at Gloucester, called a
council there, when it was determined that the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and the Bishops of Chester and Rochester, should be
sent into Wales with offers of pardon for all past injuries, and
proposals of peace if they would return to their obedience, which
being accepted, peace was restored; notwithstanding, soon after
this the Earl was treacherously drawn away into Ireland, and <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>there killed,
being stabbed in the back with a dagger.&nbsp; The peace with the
Welsh had but a short continuance, for in the year 1241 the King
marched with his army from Gloucester to Shrewsbury, designing
from thence to have proceeded into Wales against David ap
Llewellyn, but during his residence here, a submission being made
by David, he stopped his march.&nbsp; In 1267, Henry again
appeared in Shrewsbury at the head of his army, designing to
march against Llewellyn, whose restless temper created new
disturbances; but by the mediation of the Pope&rsquo;s Legate,
and upon Llewellyn&rsquo;s submission, a peace was
concluded.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward I. we find the
disturbances of the Welsh still continued; upon which account the
courts of exchequer and king&rsquo;s bench were removed to
Shrewsbury, that the Welsh might be awed into submission.&nbsp;
The situation of the inhabitants of Shropshire at this period was
peculiarly distressing: they were continually subject to the
depredations and incursions of the Welsh, their hostile and
unmerciful neighbours; and the wolves inhabiting the desolate
mountains of that country, frequently came down in herds, and
ravaged whole districts.&nbsp; A commission was given to Peter
Corbet to destroy all he could find; and by offering a sum of
money to those who killed a certain number, and brought their
heads to Shrewsbury, they were in a short time considerably
reduced.</p>
<p>Bishop Burnell was Chancellor in the year 1283, and the Lords
and Commons assembled at his seat at Acton Burnell, the Lords
sitting in the castle, and the Commons in a barn belonging to the
monastery of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; On this occasion, the famous
statute of Acton Burnell was made, called the statute merchant,
by which act debtors in London, York, and Bristol were obliged to
appear before the different mayors, and agree upon a certain day
for payment, otherwise an execution was issued against their
goods, for imprisonment for debt did not take place till some
hundred years after this time.&nbsp; The Parliament was again
summoned to meet at Shrewsbury, on the morrow after Michaelmas
day, to consult what course should be taken with David, Prince of
Wales, whom the King declares he had received in his banishment,
had nursed while an orphan, and enriched out of his
possessions.&nbsp; David, having fled from his brother Llewellyn,
Prince of Wales, who had imprisoned his two brothers, Owen and
Roderick, the King received him into his service, created him
Earl of Denbigh, and gave him land to the yearly value of a
thousand marks, in lieu of those possessions he ought to have had
in Anglesey, and, to attach him to the interests of England, gave
him to wife a rich English heiress; David, however, never ceased
to excite his brother Llewellyn, to free himself from the English
yoke, because, as his brother had no children, he was his
presumptive successor.&nbsp; Llewellyn took up arms, and
penetrated into the territories of the English, where he defeated
two of their armies.&nbsp; Edward, in hopes of being more
fortunate, marched, at the head of a numerous army, when
Llewellyn retired to Snowdon Hill, where he could not be
attacked, but at length, regardless of the inequalities of his
forces, he descended into the plain, to fight the English.&nbsp;
The English proved victorious, Llewellyn was slain on the spot,
and his army entirely routed, and David, his brother, after some
time roving about the country, was taken by the English, and,
with his wife, two sons, and seven daughters, sent to Rhyddlan
Castle, where the King then was.&nbsp; As he was the last of the
race of the Welsh Princes, Edward was inclined to secure his late
conquest by his death; accordingly, after having been for some
time kept prisoner, he was brought to Shrewsbury, where he was
tried by the Parliament, and, by their advice, on the 30th
September, 1283, he was condemned to die.&nbsp; Thus the last of
the ancient British princes was ignominously drawn at a
horse&rsquo;s tail about the town, then hanged, afterwards
beheaded, his body quartered, and his bowels burnt; his head was
fixed near that of his brother, on the tower of London, and his
four quarters were sent to York, Bristol, Northampton, and
Winchester.&nbsp; This barbarous execution is said to have been
the first of the kind, and it was afterwards usually inflicted
upon traitors.&nbsp; An account of the Great Parliament, held in
Shrewsbury, in the time of Richard II., and of the famous battle
of Shrewsbury, will be found noticed at a subsequent page.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span><span
class="smcap">Rivers</span>.&mdash;The Severn is the principal
river in the county.&nbsp; This magnificent stream ranks next to
the Thames in point of celebrity, for the extent of its course,
the distance for which it is navigable, and the commerce it
sustains.&nbsp; It has its rise on the mountain of Plynlimmon, on
the verge of Montgomeryshire, and enters Shropshire, near
Melverley, and at Cymmeran Ferry receives the waters of the river
Vernieu.&nbsp; Between Montford Bridge and Fitz, the river Perry
falls into the Severn, which here makes a great bend, and
encloses a fine estate, of five miles in circuit, called the
Isle, the property of the Rev. H. Sandford.&nbsp; It then passes
Berwick House, and speedily arrives at Shrewsbury, from whence it
takes a circuitous route to the rural village of Uffington, and
passes by Longnor Hall, to Atcham, where it is crossed by a noble
stone bridge, not far from which it receives the waters of the
Tern.&nbsp; Winding its devious way, the Severn skirts the
village of Cound, and near the ruins of Buildwas Abbey, is
crossed by a neat iron bridge.&nbsp; It shortly after passes by
Coalbrook dale, near to which it is crossed by a second iron
bridge, which gives name to the populous district surrounding
it.&nbsp; Two miles below is Coalport, celebrated for the
extensive porcelain manufactures.&nbsp; The river, having passed
here, proceeds to Apley Castle, and shortly after reaches the
town of Bridgnorth, and is here crossed by a magnificent stone
bridge.&nbsp; Thence proceeding to the south-east, it passes by
Quatt, and leaves this county by the parish of Alveley, passing
through a narrow slip of the county of Stafford, it arrives at
Bewdley, in Worcestershire.&nbsp; From its source in Plynlimmon
Hill to the sea, the Severn runs about 220 miles.&nbsp; It is
navigable to Shrewsbury, but few vessels, however, proceed
further than Ironbridge, the navigation being interrupted by
shallows, and the great irregularities of the water.&nbsp; By
means of numerous canals the navigation is extended into every
part of the kingdom, being united with the Thames on the east,
and with the Trent, the Humber, and the Mersey, towards the
north; thus forming the grand outlet and channel for the commerce
of the kingdom on the south east.&nbsp; The river takes its name
from <i>Sabi</i> and <i>Sabrin</i>, sandy; in Latin
<i>Sabrina</i>; in Welsh, <i>Haurian</i>, signifying the queen or
chief of rivers.&nbsp; By the statute of 23rd of Henry VIII., it
is enacted, that no person shall ask or demand any toll for going
on the path, by the side of the said river, upon pain to forfeit
forty shillings.&nbsp; These statutes were to supersede all
patents and commissions granted to particular persons by the
prerogative of the Crown.&nbsp; Excellent fish are caught in this
river, particularly salmon, trout, pike, shad, flounders, and
carp.</p>
<p>Among the waters which contribute to swell the current of the
Severn, in addition to the Vernieu and Perry, already noticed, is
the Meole-brook, a considerable stream, which enters the river at
Coleham.&nbsp; The Meole is increased by the Rea, before it joins
the Meole, the former receiving upwards of a dozen smaller
streams, before it has its confluence with the Meole.&nbsp; The
Tern has its rise from a large pool in Staffordshire.&nbsp; At
Willow Bridge, it first takes the name of Tern, and, from this
place to within a short distance of Drayton, divides the counties
of Salop and Stafford.&nbsp; A little below Ternhill, it crosses
the turnpike road, where there is a stone bridge, called Tern
Bridge; it then proceeds by Stoke, Bolas, Upton Waters, and has
its junction with the Severn a little below Atcham Bridge.&nbsp;
This river has a course of about thirty miles, and receives the
Cherrington brook, the Strine, the Roden, and several other
nameless streams, on its route.&nbsp; Between Cound and
Bridgnorth the Severn receives five or six small brooks, which
flow from the western part of the county, and two small streams
join it from the east.&nbsp; Below Bridgnorth the river Worfe and
several small brooks, add their influence to swell the current of
the majestic Severn.</p>
<p>The streams that irrigate Shropshire, north of the Severn, and
do not fall into it, are the Morles, which rises in Sellatyn, and
runs into the Ceiriog, which joins the Dee near Chirk.&nbsp;
Shel-brook runs into the Dee from near Welsh Hampton.&nbsp;
Elf-brook, near Whitchurch, and the Weever, with three
contributary streams, become a considerable river through
Cheshire.&nbsp; South of the Severn, and not far from the course
of the Camlet, we <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>meet with the Clun, which joins the Teme, near
Leintwardine, in Herefordshire.&nbsp; Kemp brook, and four
others, fall into the Clun.&nbsp; The Ony joins the Teme near
Oakley Park.&nbsp; This river, for some distance, runs parallel
with the Camlet, which, in its course, has a fall of about 300
feet.&nbsp; Stadbrook, and another small stream, having joined
the Ony, have their confluence with the Teme, and at Ludlow the
Teme is augmented by the Corve, which flows for many miles
through a valley, to which it gives name.&nbsp; The Corve is
augmented by two brooks, one of which is a junction of three
small streams.&nbsp; Ledwick brook, with three contributary
streams, and the Rea, with five, joins the Teme, which, having
formed the boundary of the county, finally leaves it near
Tenbury, in Worcestershire, and falls into the Severn below the
capital of that county.&nbsp; The Rodon is formed by the
confluence of three streams, which, in very dry summers, lose
their currents.&nbsp; The first of these rises on Whixall Moss;
the second, on Bettesfield Heath, in Flintshire; and the third
proceeds from the White Meer, in the township of Lee.&nbsp; The
three rivulets meet on Wolverly meadows, and passing by
Loppington, runs on to Wem, and thence by Shawbury, to
Roddington, and has its confluence with the Tern not far from
Withington.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Canals</span>.&mdash;The first canal in
Shropshire was formed by William Reynolds, Esq., in 1788, for the
purpose of conveying ironstone and coal from the Oaken Gates to
Ketley.&nbsp; Shortly after an act of parliament was obtained for
the <span class="smcap">Shropshire Canal</span>, which was
finished in 1792.&nbsp; It commences at Donington Wood, and
proceeds about one hundred yards on a level; it then descends one
hundred and twenty feet, by an inclined plane of three hundred
and twenty yards from the top of this inclined plane, which is
the highest level of the canal; it proceeds by Wrockwardine and
Snedshill, and near to Oaken Gates, where it is joined by the
Ketley canal.&nbsp; From this junction it is continued to
Southall Bank, where a branch strikes off to the right, and
terminates at Brierly Hill.&nbsp; The main line, turning to the
Southall Bank, goes on to the Windmill farm, and passes to the
east of Madeley, until it reaches the banks of the Severn; here
it descends 207 feet by an inclined plane, which is 350 yards in
length, from whence it proceeds parallel with the river to
Coalport, where it terminates.&nbsp; Immediately after the
completion of this, the <span class="smcap">Shropshire
Canal</span> was projected.&nbsp; The Company, having purchased
about a mile of the north end of the canal cut by Mr. Reynolds,
erected an inclined plane of 233 yards in length, and 75 feet of
fall.&nbsp; From the termination of this plane the canal passes
on by Eyton Mill, to Long lane, where it traverses a valley of
considerable length, and crosses the river Tern, 16 feet above
the surface of the Meadow, by means of an aqueduct and an
embankment.&nbsp; Near this place it crosses the turnpike road
from Shrewsbury to Wellington, then passing on to Rodington, and
over the river Roden, through Wellington, to Atcham, it enters a
tunnel of 970 yards in length.&nbsp; Thence it passes at the base
of Haughmond Hill, and along the banks of the Severn, it
terminates in a large basin, near the Castle Foregate, at
Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The Ellesmere navigation, or the Shropshire Union railway and
canal company may be called a system of canals extending through
the large and fertile tract of country which lies between the
banks of the Severn and those of the Mersey, and between the
confines of North Wales on the west and the borders of
Staffordshire on the east&mdash;a space of fifty miles in length,
and more than twenty in breadth, exclusive of the valleys which
open into North Wales.&nbsp; Its grand object is to unite the
Severn, the Dee, and the Mersey, and by that means to open a
communication from the above mentioned districts to the ports of
Liverpool and Bristol.&nbsp; There is a short canal formed by the
Marquis of Stafford, which commences at Donington Wood and
proceeds to Pave-lane, near Newport, a distance of nearly seven
miles, with a branch to his lordship&rsquo;s lime works at
Lilleshall, This canal was made for conveying coal to the latter
place from the works at Donington, now held on lease by the
Lilleshall company.&nbsp; The Montgomeryshire canal, a branch of
Ellesmere, also passes through a portion of this county.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span><span
class="smcap">Lakes of Shropshire</span>.&mdash;The lakes of this
county are neither numerous nor extensive.&nbsp; At Marton, near
Baschurch, is the Marton and Fennymere pool, covering 96<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 15<span
class="smcap">p</span>.&nbsp; At Marton, near Chirbury, is a pool
covering 40<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 37<span class="smcap">p</span>., from
which issue three streams running in different directions.&nbsp;
At Ellesmere is a magnificent sheet of water covering 116 acres;
Colemere 87 acres; Crosemere 44 acres; Whitemere 62 acres;
Blackmere and Newtonmere are in the same neighbourhood.&nbsp; A
fine sheet of water at Shrawardine covers 40 acres.&nbsp; South
of the Severn are a few small lakes, but not of any considerable
extent.&nbsp; Thus the part of the country which abounds most in
running water has the fewest pools.&nbsp; At Walcot and Hawkstone
are lakes of considerable extent, the latter stretches two miles
in length.&nbsp; Sundorne, Halston, and Tong, have embellishments
of the same kind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Roads and Railways</span>.&mdash;The
principal line of road crossing this county is the London and
Holyhead parliamentary mail road, which between Wolverhampton and
Shiffnal, runs through Shrewsbury and enters Denbighshire, near
Chirk.&nbsp; The traffic on this road has been much diminished
since the opening of the railways between London and
Liverpool.&nbsp; The Chester, Shrewsbury, and Bristol road enters
near Whitchurch, and runs southward by Shrewsbury, Church
Stretton, and Ludlow, into Herefordshire.&nbsp; A branch leads
from Ludlow to Bishop&rsquo;s Castle and Montgomery.&nbsp; Mail
and other roads run between Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth, Ludlow,
and Birmingham, across the Clee Hills, Ludlow, Wenlock, and
Coalbrook-dale, and Ludlow and Bridgnorth.&nbsp; There are also
various other communications between Newport, Drayton, and
Wellington, &amp;c.&nbsp; The principal railroads are the
Shrewsbury and Chester, the Shrewsbury and Birmingham, and the
Shropshire Union.&nbsp; The former on leaving the station at
Shrewsbury crosses the Castle Foregate by a cast iron bridge, and
proceeding by Leaton Heath, Baschurch, and Whittington, passes on
to Gabowen, where there is a short branch to Oswestry, having ten
trains running daily.&nbsp; The trunk line then proceeds to
Preesgwene, where there is a station, and shortly after passes
into the county of Denbigh, and on to Chester.&nbsp; The
Shrewsbury and Birmingham and the Stafford branch of the
Shropshire union railways have a line formed by the joint
companies, extending from Shrewsbury to a little beyond
Wellington, where one branches off to Shiffnal and Wolverhampton,
and the other to Newport, and from thence to Stafford.&nbsp; An
act of parliament has been obtained for a railway from Shrewsbury
to Hereford, which will open a communication with the southern
parts of the county of Shropshire.&nbsp; The works between
Shrewsbury and Ludlow are in a rapid state of progress, and the
line to the latter place is expected to be open for traffic in
December, 1851.&nbsp; The length of this railway will be fifty
miles, and the estimated cost &pound;354,822.&nbsp; The line from
Ludlow to Hereford is expected to be completed in 1852.&nbsp; It
is to Shropshire, and some of its intelligent and enterprising
natives that the all absorbing system of railways, which now
intersect Great Britain, and cover its surface like net-work,
owes its discovery and establishment.&nbsp; It was adopted in the
year 1767, by that celebrated firm of iron masters, the
Coalbrook-dale Company, who hit upon the expedient of laying the
pig iron upon the wood rails throughout their extensive works,
bearing in mind that in the event of a rise in the price of iron,
the rails could easily be taken up and vended as pig iron.&nbsp;
Thus, to this somewhat accidental appropriation of iron, and the
facilities it rendered to the easy and safe carriage of heavy
materials, coupled with the important discovery of steam power,
and the general improvement in engineering incident to railroad
travelling, this important discovery and attainment of modern
times may justly be ascribed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mines and Manufactures</span>.&mdash;The
minerals of this county are of great importance.&nbsp; Its rich
coal formations, and the limestone and ironstone associated with
them, afford employment to thousands.&nbsp; There are coal pits
in many parts of the county, but more particularly in the east,
at the several places of Lilleshall, Stirchley, Dawley, and the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; An immense quantity of the coal is consumed
in the iron furnaces, the <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>principal of which are at
Coalbrook-dale, Horse-hay, Old-park, Ketley, Snedshill, and
Oakengates.&nbsp; About seven per cent. of the iron manufactured
in the whole kingdom is raised from the mines in this
district.&nbsp; Lead is got in considerable quantities on the
western verge of the county, but is chiefly confined to the
hundred of Ford.&nbsp; The Snailbeach, Gravels, and Bathole
mines, are the most productive; the lead ore got is usually of
very superior quality.&nbsp; Calamine is also met with, and the
rock at Pimhill is strongly tinctured with copper.&nbsp; Symptoms
of both copper and lead appear in the Cardington hills, and at
Pitchford a mineral pitch exudes from the red sandstone.&nbsp;
Freestone, slate, and pipe-clay are found.&nbsp; At Ashford, on
the banks of the Tern below Ludlow, is the Salt-moor Spring,
where salt was made at the period of the Norman Conquest.</p>
<p>China, of great excellence and exquisite workmanship, is made
at Coalport; earthenware is also manufactured, particularly
Wedgewood-ware, at Coalport and Broseley.&nbsp; Carpets are
extensively made at Bridgnorth, and there are three
establishments for the manufacture of hair seating at Market
Drayton.&nbsp; There is an extensive factory at Shrewsbury where
linen thread is made, and woollens of a coarse texture are made
at Church Stretton.&nbsp; Nails are made in several places.&nbsp;
At the Coalbrook-dale Company all kinds of castings and almost
every article in which iron is used is there manufactured.&nbsp;
Paper is made at two or three places in the county.&nbsp; The
chief manufacture of the county is that of iron.&nbsp; The
beautiful art of glass staining has been brought to great
perfection by Mr. David Evans, of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Agricultural Produce</span>.&mdash;The
whole country is in general well cultivated, yielding good crops
of all kinds of grain, turnips, peas, and potatoes.&nbsp; There
are many fine orchards scattered throughout the county,
particularly in the southern division, and hops are cultivated on
a small scale on the southern border.&nbsp; The meadows near the
Severn are extremely fertile, being frequently enriched by the
overflowing of that river; but the grass land receives less
attention from the farmer than the arable.&nbsp; The northern
part of the county is remarkable for its dairy produce, the
cheese being equal to the most celebrated dairies of the
adjoining county of Chester.&nbsp; The sizes of the farms are
various, but large farms of from 400 to 800 acres are much more
numerous than in the adjoining counties.&nbsp; In many parts of
the county five or six small holdings have been taken from the
humbler class of farmers and let to one tenant.&nbsp; In one
township visited by our agent the land held by fourteen different
tenants, within memory of man, is now held by three
farmers.&nbsp; Barley and wheat in many parts are grown to a
considerable extent.&nbsp; The arable and pasture lands are found
in about equal proportions.&nbsp; The cattle are mostly of a fine
breed, many of the farmers being noted for the superiority of
their stock, but there does not appear any peculiar breed which
can be affirmed as exclusively belonging to this county.&nbsp; In
the northern division of the county and on the western borders
large flocks of sheep are kept, in some parts the old Shropshire
breed may frequently be observed; they are distinguished by their
black mottled faces and legs, and are in size nearly as large as
the south-down.&nbsp; About half a century ago a breed of neat
cattle prevailed very much, resembling the Lancashire
long-horns.&nbsp; The old Shropshire ox was remarkable for a
large dewlap.&nbsp; This county was formerly famous for a breed
of pigs which is now almost extinct.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Climate</span>, <span
class="smcap">Soil</span>, <span class="smcap">and
Aspect</span>.&nbsp; The climate of this county is in general
very salubrious; but, from the irregularity of its soil and
surface, it varies in dryness and geniality.&nbsp; On the east,
where the land is warm and flat, the harvest is frequently ripe
sooner than in the middle of the county, where the vales are
extensive, but the surface light, and the bottom often
clayey.&nbsp; But hay and grain are both gathered earlier in the
middle of the county than on the western side, where the vales
are narrow, and the high lands frequent and extensive, although
the ground in general is not so stiff, and lies for the most part
on the rock.&nbsp; The easterly winds prevail in spring, and
westerly in autumn.&nbsp; Few counties are possessed of a greater
variety of soil than this, as will be seen on reference to the
respective <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>parishes.&nbsp; Divided into nearly two equal parts by
the Severn, its southern portion assumes the mountainous
character peculiar to the counties of Montgomery and Denbigh,
whilst the north half approaches more nearly to a level,
agreeably relieved by bold swells, and romantic valleys finely
wooded.&nbsp; The landscape possesses every variety of natural
charms, the bold and lofty mountain, the woody and secluded
valley, the fertile and widely cultured plain, the majestic
river, and the sequestered lake; and is no less rich in those
remains of ancient times which awaken a thousand enthusiastic
reflections by engaging us in the contemplation of the memorable
events of our history.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Agricultural Improvements</span>.&nbsp;
Great improvements by draining, enclosure, and superior
management have been progressing for the last half century in
most parts of the county.&nbsp; This has been accomplished on
many estates by the united efforts of the landlords and tenants;
the former finding tiles and materials, and the latter performing
all the draught work at their own expense.&nbsp; The farms in
Shropshire were formerly much smaller than they now are, which
was found a great obstacle to improvement.&nbsp; They did not
invite men of capital, and to manage a farm successfully, like
any other occupation or business, it is necessary that the
occupant should possess sufficient capital; for without it, it is
useless to expect improvement or profitable cultivation.&nbsp;
The want of it is unfortunately too common among farmers.&nbsp;
Wanting it in the onset, they have not been able to acquire any,
and thus have gone on from year to year with difficulty, perhaps
deteriorating the soil, and reducing the little capital they
possessed.&nbsp; The farmers&rsquo; clubs, established for the
discussion of practical husbandry, have had a tendency to develop
many hidden facts, and to dispel deep-rooted prejudices by
friendly argument and interchange of thought.&nbsp; Farmers
seldom meet to exchange ideas but at these associations, which
may be considered in the character of Normal schools, where the
old and young may impart and receive information on many things
connected with their occupation.&nbsp; On the whole Shropshire is
before many other counties in agricultural improvements.&nbsp;
The judicious application of capital, superintended by men of
true practical science, will make it one of the finest
agricultural counties in England.&nbsp; The farm houses are
mostly composed of brick, and have been greatly improved within
the last thirty years, particular attention having been paid to
the conveniency of the outbuildings and farm yards, which in many
instances are of great extent and admirably contrived.</p>
<p>The following returns of the population of the fifteen Unions
into which the county of Shropshire is divided, are copied from
the Parliamentary reports of the census taken March 31st, 1851;

<p><span class="smcap">Monastic Institutions</span>.&nbsp; The
following is a list of the religious houses and monastic
institutions which formerly existed in Shropshire, with their
annual value as returned at their suppression.&nbsp; The
Benedictine monks had a great Abbey at Shrewsbury, returned as of
the annual value of &pound;132. 4s. 10d.&nbsp; Haughmond Abbey,
&pound;259. 13s. 7&frac14;d.&nbsp; Buildwas Abbey, &pound;110.

l&frac12;d.&nbsp; Bridgnorth Hospital, &pound;4.&nbsp; Ludlow
Hospital, &pound;17. 13s. 3d.&nbsp; Wenlock Priory, &pound;401.
0s. 7&frac14;d.&nbsp; St. Chad&rsquo;s College, Shrewsbury,
&pound;14. 14s. 4d.&nbsp; St. Mary&rsquo;s College, &pound;13.
1s. 8d.&nbsp; According to Speed there was also a Monastery of
Black Monks at Bromfield, a Priory at Chirbury, with various
cells and chantries, which will be found noticed in the several
parishes in which they were respectively situated.&nbsp; It was
one of the singular characteristics of the Roman Catholic Church,
that it gave scope to partial reformation.&nbsp; What among
Protestants would be called a new sect, became in that church
merely a new order.&nbsp; From time to time, men arose to recall
attention to some doctrine or practice, which had fallen into
disuse, and for a revival of which a necessity was felt.&nbsp;
The church gave scope to their zeal, and benefited by their
efforts till they, in turn, became rich and corrupt, and other
reformers were needed.&nbsp; About the year 1120, the rule of St.
Augustine was reformed by St. Norbet.&nbsp; He professed that the
Virgin Mary had pointed out the site on which he was to found a
new church, and that she had prescribed the white habits the
monks were to wear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Abbeys</span>.&mdash;In a society of
religious persons, whether male or female, where an abbot or
abbess presided, it was styled an abbey.&nbsp; The governor had
the sole power over the convent, could appoint or discharge any
officer at pleasure, and prescribe what rules the monks or nuns
should be obliged to observe.&nbsp; The abbots have enjoyed the
privilege of conferring the lower orders of priesthood, but in
the essential points of jurisdiction they were everywhere subject
to the diocesan bishop.&nbsp; The consequence of the abbots grew
with the wealth of their monasteries, several received episcopal
titles and privileges, all held rank next to that of a bishop,
and had a vote in the ecclesiastical councils.&nbsp; Equal
privileges and rights appertained to the abbesses, as the
superior of the nunneries, except that they were not allowed to
vote at synods.&nbsp; When the society of religious persons
consisted of men, it was called a monastery.&nbsp; There is
reason to believe that there were monasteries in Britain before
the end of the 4th century.&nbsp; In the course of the 7th
century many monasteries were founded in all parts of
England.&nbsp; These monasteries were designed in some places for
the seats of the bishops and their clergy; in others, for their
secular priests, who preached and administered the sacraments
over the neighbouring country, and in most instances, they were
seminaries of learning for the education of youth.&nbsp; If a
monastery or nunnery was subject to another, it was called a
<span class="GutSmall">CELL</span>.&nbsp; The great English
abbeys had many such cells in distant places.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Priories</span>.&mdash;When the chief
person in a Monastery bore the name of Prior, it was styled a
Priory.&nbsp; These religious houses were of two
sorts&mdash;either they were such whose prior was independent, or
they were such as depended upon some great abbey, from which they
received their Prior, and to which they were often obliged to pay
a small pension or annual acknowledgment.&nbsp; Whenever the
Convent to which they belonged was beyond the seas, then it was
styled an alien Priory.&nbsp; These last transmitted their
revenues to their foreign superior, for which reason their
estates were generally seized to carry on the wars between
England and France.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Preceptories</span>.&mdash;Whenever the
Knights Templars, or Hospitallers, had any considerable manors or
farms, they erected a church for the service of God, and built a
convenient house of habitation, to which they sent out their
fraternity, under the command of a Preceptor.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Chantries</span> were chapels erected and endowed
for the singing of masses for the souls of the deceased.&nbsp;
Chantry rents are still paid to the Crown by the purchaser of
their lands.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Hospitals</span> were
small convents, occupied by a few monks, for the entertainment of
all who went any pilgrimage on religious pretence.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Guilds</span> were societies of lay brethren, who
lived together like monks, but were of no professed order.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Grey Friars</span> were at first called
<i>Franciscans</i>, from the name of their founder, St. Francis:
they were likewise called <i>Minorites</i>, from their being the
lowest and most humble of all orders; and <i>Observants</i>, from
their great strictness to the rules of their order.&nbsp; They
were styled mendicants, from their professing wilful poverty,
subsisting chiefly upon alms, which they <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>used to ask
from door to door, by which they were distinguished from monks,
who kept at home within their convents, and lived in common upon
their substance.&nbsp; Their habit was a long grey coat down to
their heels, with a cowl or hood, and a cord about their loins,
instead of a girdle.&nbsp; Many privileges were granted them, and
many of high degree were ambitious of living, dying, and being
interred in the habit of these Franciscans.&nbsp; The <i>Black
Friars</i>, so called from their habit, a black cope and cowl
over a white coat, were likewise called <i>Dominicans</i>, from
their having been founded by St. Dominick; and black preaching
friars, because they were the only preachers of all the
friars.&nbsp; These monks obtained extensive grants of land, and
had many persons of note within their convents.&nbsp; The
<i>White Friars</i> took their name from the dress they
wore.&nbsp; They came into England in 1325, and first settled at
Canterbury.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ecclesiastical Revenues</span>.&mdash;The
Ecclesiastical Commissioners were appointed under an act passed
in the 6th and 7th of William IV., for the general improvement
and equalization of the dioceses, for the dividing of extensive
parishes, and augmenting small livings, and the adopting such
other measures as may conduce to the efficiency of the
Established Church.&nbsp; The Archbishop of Canterbury, the
Archbishop of York, the Bishop of London, the Bishop of Lincoln,
the Bishop of Gloucester, the Lord High Chancellor, the President
of the Council, the Lord High Treasurer, and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, with others, form a body politic and corporate, by
the name of the &ldquo;Ecclesiastical Commissioners of
England,&rdquo; for the purpose of the said act.&nbsp; The
Commissioners reported, in 1835, that the total amount of the
gross annual revenues of the several Archiepiscopal and Episcopal
Sees of England and Wales was &pound;181,631.&nbsp; The total
amount of the net annual revenues of the several cathedral and
collegiate churches in England and Wales was &pound;284,241; and
the total amount of the net revenues of the same,
&pound;208,209.&nbsp; The total amount of the gross annual
separate revenues of the several dignitaries and other spiritual
persons, members of the cathedrals and other collegiate churches,
in England and Wales, was &pound;75,854.&nbsp; The total number
of benefices, with and without cure of souls, the incumbents
whereof have made enquiries to the returns of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, omitting those which are permanently or
occasionally annexed to superior preferments, are 10,540; the
gross annual revenue of these benefices is &pound;3,197,225;
giving an average income of &pound;303.&nbsp; The total number of
benefices, with and without cure of souls, in England and Wales,
including those not returned, but exclusive of those annexed to
other preferments, (about 24 in number) is 10,718; the total
gross income of which, calculated upon the average of those
returned, amounts to &pound;3,251,159; and the net income
thereof, &pound;3,055,451.&nbsp; The number of curates returned,
as employed by resident incumbents, was 1000, whose annual
stipends or payments in money amounted to &pound;87,075;
affording an average of &pound;86, Those employed by
non-residents were 4,124; the amount of their stipends,
&pound;337,620; average, &pound;79: and the average of the whole
of the curates&rsquo; stipends, &pound;81.&nbsp; In concluding
their report, the commissioners state that the archbishops and
bishops in possession of their preferments, are subject to heavy
expenses, and that the charges for first fruits and fees
generally exceed the amount of their receipts for the first two
or three years, after entering office.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty</span>; <span
class="smcap">First Fruits and Tenths</span>.&mdash;From the
earliest periods every bishop and clergyman has been required to
pay the amount of his first year&rsquo;s incumbency into a fund,
and every succeeding year one tenth.&nbsp; These first fruits and
tenths were formerly collected at their full value, and applied
to the use of the pope, as early as the time of Pope Nicholas
(<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1200).&nbsp; For this purpose
a valuation was made of all the livings in England, which is
still preserved in the Remembrancer&rsquo;s office, and
designated, &ldquo;Valor of Pope Nicholas IV.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
time of the Reformation, King Henry VIII. passed a law, with the
sanction of Parliament, declaring that the first fruits and
tenths should be appropriated to the use of the state; and he
caused an accurate and full valuation to be made of all the
ecclesiastical livings in England and Wales, which were
accordingly paid into <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>the public exchequer, till the reign
of Queen Anne, with the exception of a short period in the reign
of Philip and Mary.&nbsp; Queen Anne, deploring the wretched
condition in which many of the clergy were placed, owing to the
insufficiency of their livings, came to the determination that
the first fruits and tenths should be paid into a fund, called
<i>Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty</i>, and that the amount should be
appropriated to the livings of the poor clergy.&nbsp; No fresh
valuation has been made since 1535, and registered in what is now
called the <i>King&rsquo;s Book</i>, till that made by order of
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, in 1835, on which the payments
are now regulated.&nbsp; That the payments might not operate
oppressively, the first year&rsquo;s income was to be paid in
four annual instalments; and livings of small value were entirely
exempt, and hence, called &ldquo;<i>Discharged
livings</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the time of Popery, a large
portion of the tithes had been alienated from the parishes, for
the endowment of religious houses, or for chantries, to say
masses for the dead.&nbsp; These endowments, at the Reformation,
being seized by Henry VIII., left the greater part of the
parochial livings very poor.&nbsp; The governors of Queen
Anne&rsquo;s Bounty, sometimes aided by benefactions, and at
others by Parliamentary grants, for the endowment of churches,
have been able to augment many of the poorest livings, and now
the resources at the command of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners,
by various reductions in cathedral and collegiate churches, will
cause the church livings, in a few years, to be considerably
equalized: The receipts for the year 1846, amounted to
&pound;206,502.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;The parochial
accounts of the posthumous charities are given from the
voluminous reports of the commissioners deputed by parliament to
enquire into the state and appropriation of public charities in
England.&nbsp; This commission commenced in 1817, and was not
finished till the year 1839.&nbsp; The charities bequeathed by
numerous individuals for the education and relief of the poor of
this county, produce collectively the large sum of &pound;21,578.
6s. 4d.&nbsp; In addition to this a very large amount is
subscribed by the benevolent inhabitants, for the support of the
various charitable institutions, among which are free schools,
hospitals, dispensaries, lunatic asylums, and various societies
for relieving the poor, &amp;c.&nbsp; The summary of the reports
of the Commissioners of Inquiry into charities show that in
England there are 442,915 acres, or about 690 square miles,
belonging to charities, which is little less than the area of
Worcestershire.&nbsp; The rent of these lands is &pound;874,313
per annum.&nbsp; The amount of rent charge is near &pound;80,000
per annum, a great part of which is made up of very small
sums.&nbsp; The interest of the money (above &pound;6,000,000)
which belongs to charities is &pound;255,151 per annum; the whole
income of the charity property inquired into by the commissioners
is &pound;1,209,395 per annum.&nbsp; Now all this is not derived
from one plain single source, but from all the counties of
England; from numerous rent charges, money in the funds,
mortgages, personal and turnpike securities, &amp;c.&nbsp;
Further, this only includes the charities inquired into by the
commissioners.&nbsp; We believe that the commissioners have here
and there missed a few charities.&nbsp; New charities are daily
increasing, and those not included in the inquiry are very
numerous.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Parish Registers</span>.&mdash;The
earliest of the parish registers date from the establishment of
the Church of England, injunctions to this effect having been
issued by Cromwell, Henry&rsquo;s vicegerent in ecclesiastical
matters in 1538.&nbsp; The canons now in force date their
authority from the beginning of the reign of James I., <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1603.&nbsp; One of these prescribes
minutely the manner entries are to be made in the parish
registers, and contains a respective clause, appointing that the
ancient registers, as far as they could be procured, should be
copied in a parchment book.&nbsp; This new regulation appears to
have been carried into effect, so that the only parish registers
now extant are transcripts commencing with Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; The parish register act of 1812
obviated some of the previous sources of error, and insured the
further usefulness of the registers of that period.&nbsp; But a
satisfactory system of registration was not established until the
year 1837, when the act for registering births, deaths, and
marriages came into operation in England and Wales.&nbsp; The
registration of births is considerably more complete than the old
parochial registers of baptism, and the register of deaths is
believed to be very complete.</p>

33</span>HISTORY <span class="GutSmall">OF</span>
SHREWSBURY.</h2>
<p>SHREWSBURY is a market town, and borough corporate and
parliamentary, situate 153 miles N.W. of London, 40 miles S. from
Chester, 40 miles W. from Lichfield, 44 miles W.N.W. from
Birmingham, 53 miles N. from Hereford, 58 miles S. from
Liverpool, 109 miles N. from Bristol, and 108 miles S.E. from
Holyhead.&nbsp; The town stands nearly in the centre of the
county of which it is the capital, and occupies two hills of
gentle ascent, which gradually rise from the bed of the river
Severn, whose stream gracefully bends its course around three
sides of the town; thus forming a peninsula, having a narrow
isthmus, not more than three hundred yards across, to the north
east.&nbsp; Shrewsbury covers nearly the whole peninsula,
excepting a narrow margin of meadow and garden grounds, which
runs between the walls and the river.&nbsp; It has gradually
extended beyond the boundaries of the river, forming the populous
suburbs of Abbey Foregate and Coleham on the east, Frankwell on
the west, and Castle Foregate, beyond the neck of the isthmus,
stretching towards the north.&nbsp; The bold situation of the
town, rising amidst a vast plain, backed with mountains&mdash;the
frowning castle&mdash;the elegant towers and tapering spires of
the churches&mdash;the noble bridges, and picturesque buildings,
produce, altogether, a scene of singular beauty and
grandeur.&nbsp; The delightful prospects from every side of the
town, over a rich and finely wooded country, adorned by the
meanderings of the Severn, are surpassed by none, and equalled
but by few other towns of our island.</p>
<p>The streets, in common with those of almost all our old towns,
are irregularly disposed, some of them steep and narrow, and
indifferently paved.&nbsp; In this respect, however, considerable
improvements have been made in some of the principal
thoroughfares.&nbsp; Many of the houses have the characteristics
of high antiquity impressed upon them; and the domestic
architecture of former days, with projecting gables, is often
intermixed with that of modern erection, and of elegant
appearance.&nbsp; The close wooden-built alley, called a
&ldquo;shutt&rdquo; in the provincial dialect of the place, is
everywhere seen connecting the principal streets with each
other.&nbsp; Although the gravelly banks on which the town stands
afford a fall in every direction, by which it might easily be
kept from filth and damp, yet the peculiarly pleasant situation
was for a long period but little regarded.&nbsp; Many important
alterations have, however, been made under the provisions of an
Act of Parliament obtained in 1821, for removing obstructions,
watching, lighting, and the general improvement of the town; the
powers of which are vested in trustees, who must be persons
occupying property rated at &pound;50 per annum, or worth
&pound;2,000.&nbsp; The streets are now lighted with gas, and the
town is supplied with an abundance of excellent water.&nbsp; Its
elevated situation, the natural dryness of the soil, and its pure
water, contribute, doubtless, to the salubrity for which it is so
remarkable.&nbsp; Speed quaintly observes:&mdash;&ldquo;Wholsom
is the aire, delectable and goode, yeelding the springe, and the
autumne, seed time and harveste, in a temperate condition, and
affoordeth health to the inhabitants in all seasons of the
yeere.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>ancient Britons gave the place the
name of <i>Pengwern</i>, the Saxons, <i>Scrobbes-byrig</i>; both
of which imply a fenced eminence planted with shrubs.&nbsp; The
poet and antiquary, Leland, thus beautifully accounts for its
name:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Built on a hill, fair Salop greets the eye,<br />
While Severn forms a crescent gliding by;<br />
Two bridges cross the navigable stream,<br />
And British alders gave the town a name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the census in 1801, the borough of Shrewsbury contained a
population of 14,739 souls.&nbsp; In 1841 there were 18,285
souls; of whom 8,444 were males, and 9,841 females.&nbsp; Of the
former, 3,589, and of the latter, 3,803 were under the age of
twenty years.&nbsp; Of the entire population, 14,341 persons were
born in this county, and 3,944 elsewhere.&nbsp; At the same
period, there were 3,727 inhabited houses, 342 uninhabited, and
23 building.</p>
<p>Shrewsbury is supposed to have been built by the Britons,
between the years 520 and 594, as a refuge from the Saxons, who
levelled their ancient fortress of Wroxeter with the ground, and
forced them to retreat beyond the Severn; which river then became
the boundary of the kingdom of Mercia, the most considerable of
all the kingdoms of the Heptarchy.&nbsp; On this subject, the
celebrated historians of Shrewsbury, Messrs. Owen and Blakeway,
observe: We conceive that our town was built after the Saxon
invasion; but that it owed its foundation to the Britons.&nbsp;
We cannot claim any pretensions to the dignity of a Roman
station.&nbsp; No vestige of that imperial people has ever been
discovered within its circuit.&nbsp; But a few miles lower down
the river, at the present village of Wroxeter, was the
flourishing town of <i>Uriconium</i>; and here, doubtless, after
the Romans had finally withdrawn their forces from the island,
the Britons continued to occupy the seats deserted by their
ancient masters, until they were driven from them by superior
force, to the time of which we may approximate within no very
wide range of years.&nbsp; We are in possession of the valuable
poems of Llywarc H&ecirc;n,&mdash;valuable, notwithstanding their
great obscurity, for the few rays of light which they scatter
over the darkest period of our history.&nbsp; He was a prince of
the Cambrian Britons; who, pressed by the Northumbrian Saxon,
retired towards the end of the sixth century to his countrymen in
Powis, among whom he is said to have protracted his life to the
unusual extent of 145 years, deriving thence the epithet of
<i>hen</i> or the <i>old</i>.&nbsp; His writings contain several
proofs of his acquaintance with the district now called
Shropshire.&nbsp; Its streams, Severn, and Morlas, and Tern; its
mountains, Digoll, Nescliff, and Digon; its towns, Baschurch,
Ercall, Hodnet, all appear in his poems.&nbsp; And when he speaks
also of <i>Pengwern</i>, and when it is known that this was the
Welsh name for Shrewsbury, we need not doubt that he designed by
that to mark our town, and consequently that it had then
arisen.</p>
<p>At the time the Britons abandoned Wroxeter, the situation of
Pengwern was one of eminent natural strength.&nbsp; We must not
estimate the degree of protection imparted to the place by the
Severn from our ideas by the condition of the river in the
present advanced state of cultivation.&nbsp; Whenever any country
is thinly inhabited, trees and shrubs spring up in the
uncultivated fields, and, spreading by degrees, form large
forests, which, confining the exhalations of the soil and
obstructing the course of streams, cause the rivers to overflow
and stagnate into lakes and marshes.&nbsp; The Severn, on the
eastern side of Shrewsbury, formerly ran in five channels, and
spread into a marshy lake from the foot of Wyle Cop as far as the
site of the Abbey.&nbsp; Thus the fugitives were protected by the
deep bed of the river, its sinuous windings, and the morasses of
its banks, where they might shroud themselves in the underwood
which hid the foot, and the thickets which crowned the summit of
the lofty and peninsular knoll now covered by the capital of
Shropshire.&nbsp; How long the fugitives remained in possession
of their new seat it is vain to enquire.&nbsp; But they were
followed hither by the Saxons, who reduced the place to ashes,
and the elegy of Llywarc calls upon the maidens of Pengwern
&ldquo;To quit their dwellings, and behold the habitation of
Cynddylan, the royal palace of Pengwern, wrapped in
flames.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>The
importance of the peninsular situation of Pengwern could not long
remain without an occupant; and a few years after its destruction
under Cynddylan, we find it inhabited by a king of Powis, the
capital of his kingdom, and even ranking among the twenty-eight
cities of Britain.&nbsp; The kingdom of Powis at this time
comprised the south-western parts of the counties of Cheshire,
Flint, and Denbigh, the whole of Montgomeryshire, with portions
of the counties of Radnor, Brecon, and the adjoining parts of
Shropshire, as far as the river Severn.&nbsp; Of the state of the
town, under its native princes, we possess no information.&nbsp;
The arts of civil life, which the Britons had cultivated under
their Roman masters, had totally disappeared in the course of
three centuries of uninterrupted warfare.&nbsp; A ditch, or a
rude rampart of unhewn logs, inclosing a few hovels for the
residence of the prince and the offices of religion, some wattled
huts, with a fold or two for sheep and cattle, probably composed
the whole of Pengwern Powis.&nbsp; On the invasion of the Saxons,
the new possessors gave it the appellation of
<i>Scrobbes-byrig</i>&mdash;a fenced eminence, but overgrown with
shrubs.</p>
<p>King Ethelred, in the year 1006, kept his court at Shrewsbury;
and in 1016 the inhabitants revolted to the Danish chief,
Canute.&nbsp; They were afterwards compelled to return to their
allegiance, and were severely punished for their defection by
Prince Edmund, son of Ethelred.&nbsp; Alphelm, a prince of the
blood, having been invited by Edric, duke of Mercia, and
son-in-law to Ethelred, to a banquet at Shrewsbury, and
afterwards to a hunting party, was treacherously murdered during
the chase by one Godwin, a butcher of the town, whom Edric had
hired for the purpose.&nbsp; This circumstance probably gave rise
to a custom prevalent during the reign of Edward the Confessor,
of twelve of the principal persons keeping guard over the
king&rsquo;s person when he came down to Shrewsbury, and the same
number attending him whenever he went out a hunting.&nbsp; In
this reign Shrewsbury had two hundred and fifty-two houses,
besides the mint, which was under the direction of three
officers, who were compelled to pay into the royal treasury
twenty shillings at the end of every fifteen days, while the
money was current.&nbsp; After the Norman conquest, Owen Gwynedd,
Prince of Wales, laid siege to Shrewsbury; but William the
Conqueror, who had just returned from a visit to his native
country, in order to quell the rising tumults which everywhere
began to threaten his British dominions, soon raised the siege,
and punished the English chiefs, while he took ample vengeance on
the Welsh.&nbsp; In this reign, Roger de Montgomery, the relation
and favourite of the Conqueror, was created Earl of Shrewsbury,
Arundle, and Chichester, and had a grant of nearly the whole of
the county of Shropshire, besides a hundred and fifty manors or
lordships in other parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; In one of the
deeds transferring these manorial grants, Roger styles himself
<i>Rogerius</i>, <i>Dei gratia</i>, <i>Scrobesburiensis
Comes</i>&mdash;Roger, by the grace of God, Earl of
Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>At the Doomsday survey, 1086, Shrewsbury is styled a city, and
the Abbey is said to have been founded where the parish church of
the city stood.&nbsp; This book also contains a summary of
several municipal laws, customs, and usages, for the internal
regulation of the place, and for increasing the king&rsquo;s
revenues.&nbsp; The amount of taxes at this period was &pound;20,
of which the king had two-thirds and the sheriff one, Hugh de
Montgomery, who had succeeded his father Roger in the earldom of
Shrewsbury, having been shot by an arrow from the skilful hand of
Magnus, King of Norway, was succeeded by his brother, Robert de
Belesme.&nbsp; Earl Robert united with the party who opposed the
pretensions of Prince Henry, son of William Rufus, and espoused
the claims of Robert, Duke of Normandy.&nbsp; He afterwards broke
out into open rebellion, strengthened his castles in Shropshire,
and at Shrewsbury built and fortified a flank wall, from each
side of the castle across the isthmus, down to the side of the
Severn.&nbsp; Upon this, the earl was publicly declared a
traitor, and King Henry marched against him with a considerable
force.&nbsp; The surrender of Bridgnorth to Henry induced the
earl to quit Shrewsbury, and to commit its defence to three
generals and eighty soldiers hired expressly for the
purpose.&nbsp; <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>With the assistance of a few Welsh, with whom he had
made peace, he frequently disturbed the royal forces, till, being
much harassed, he was compelled to return to Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
Soon afterwards, the town was surrounded with an army of 60,000
men; and Robert de Belesme had scarcely seated himself in the
castle, when the king demanded the immediate surrender of the
place, threatening, in case of refusal, in three days to besiege
the town, and hang every one found in the castle.&nbsp; The earl,
perceiving that he had no forces to withstand the attack of the
king, confessed his treason, implored the royal clemency, and
sent the keys of the castle by the hands of Ralph, Abbot of Seez,
afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, which the king accepted, and
banished the restless earl to Normandy.&nbsp; The spirit of
revenge and ambition, however, rekindled in his breast, and he
contrived once more to appear in arms against Henry; but was at
length taken prisoner, and ignominously conveyed in chains to
England, where he ended a miserable life a close prisoner at
Wareham.</p>
<p>In 1139, William Fitz Allan, a powerful baron, was governor of
the town and sheriff of the county.&nbsp; During the wars between
Stephen and the Empress Maude, this baron espoused the cause of
the empress, and with several noblemen opposed the forces of the
king.&nbsp; He left the castle, which he had strongly fortified,
under the command of a deputy governor, whom he compelled to
swear never to deliver his trust to the king.&nbsp; This,
however, did not prevent the monarch from taking the castle:
after which the king hanged several of the garrison for their
contumacy.&nbsp; In 1260 the English army rendezvoused at
Shrewsbury, and shortly after the town and castle fell once more
into the hands of the rebels.&nbsp; They soon after reverted to
their former owners, and the government of the town and castle
was conferred by the king on his eldest son Edward.&nbsp; In 1277
the Courts of Exchequer and King&rsquo;s Bench, during the reign
of Edward I., were removed to Shrewsbury, in which place they
appear to have been held at least for some months.</p>
<p>David, Prince of Wales, the last of the princes of the ancient
Britons, having at length become a prisoner in the hands of
Edward, in 1283, was sent in chains to Shrewsbury.&nbsp; A writ
having been issued for assembling the parliament on September
30th at this place, for the express purpose of taking into
consideration the measures necessary to be adopted with respect
to this rebellious prince.&nbsp; This is remarkable, as
&ldquo;<i>the first national convention in which the commons had
any share by legal authority</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twenty cities and
towns, Shrewsbury being one, were directed to send two deputies,
and every high sheriff to send two knights.&nbsp; The parliament
met in the chapter house, or refectory of the abbey, where David
was condemned to be drawn about the town at the tail of a horse,
then hanged, afterwards quartered, his bowels burnt, his four
quarters sent to York, Bristol, Northampton, and Winchester, and
his head fixed near that of his brother Llewelyn, on the Tower of
London.&nbsp; Thus, with the death of the last of the ancient
British princes, commenced a mode of execution, usually exercised
on traitors, disgraceful to humanity, and barbarous in its
example.</p>
<p>In the 20th of Richard II. the parliament was adjourned from
Westminster to Shrewsbury.&nbsp; On the king&rsquo;s arrival, he
gave a sumptuous feast to the peers and commons in the abbey of
St. Peter and St. Paul.&nbsp; The parliament was held in the
Chapter House, and so numerous were the members and their
retinues that Speed calls this &ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">THE
GREAT PARLIAMENT</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was certainly an
important one.&nbsp; Chester was on this occasion made a
principality, and among the articles of accusation afterwards
brought against the king by Henry Bolingbroke were the oppressive
laws which it enacted.&nbsp; The next account on record relative
to this place is the memorable <span class="smcap">Battle</span>
of <span class="smcap">Shrewsbury</span>; the skirmishing of
which began under the walls of the castle gates, but the
principal scene of action was at Battlefield.&nbsp; This
engagement between Henry IV. and the Earl of Northumberland,
fought on the plains and heaths of Battlefield and Albright
Hussey, was one of the most important recorded in English
history.&nbsp; The origin of the quarrel was a mandate from the
monarch to the earl not to ransom his Scottish prisoners taken at
Homedon, which <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>that nobleman deemed an infringement of his
rights.&nbsp; The jealous policy of Henry in this proceeding, and
his ingratitude for the services which raised him to the throne,
roused the indignation of Northumberland, and inflamed the high
soul of his son, Lord Henry Percy, whose warlike disposition had
gained him the characteristic appellation of Hotspur.&nbsp;
Thomas, Earl of Worcester, younger brother to Northumberland,
participated in their discontents, entered into their views of
revenge, and offered his assistance to overthrow the usurper whom
they had united to establish.&nbsp; Hotspur, who was the life of
the conspiracy, released and made a friend of his valiant rival,
Douglas, entered into a correspondence with Glyndwr, and reared
the standard of rebellion, around which all his vassals and
adherents rallied.&nbsp; He was joined by a powerful army from
Scotland, under Earl Douglas and other chiefs, who, impelled by a
rooted animosity to the King of England, warmly espoused the
cause of the conspirators.&nbsp; Henry, who was apprised of their
movements, placed himself at the head of a body of troops, and
hurried into Shropshire, having previously ordered his sons, the
Prince of Wales and Lord John of Lancaster, and his steady
adherent, the Earl of Westmorland, to meet him with
reinforcements at Bridgnorth.&nbsp; Aware that every thing
depended on celerity of movement, he took possession of
Shrewsbury, just as the forces of Lord Percy were preparing to
assail it.&nbsp; Owen Glyndwr having mustered a numerous levy of
Welshmen at Oswestry, sent off a detachment of 4,000, but, on
being apprised of the king&rsquo;s success, thought proper to
suspend the march of his main body.&nbsp; Had the valour of
Hotspur been tempered by discretion, he would have paused until
the junction of his ally had given him better assurance of
success.&nbsp; His army consisted of 14,000 chosen men; but the
king&rsquo;s army is said to have been nearly double that
number.&nbsp; Had Glyndwr made good his engagements, the armies
would have been about equal.&nbsp; Percy, however, had confidence
in his own prowess, and his experience of that of his compeer,
Douglas, banished every doubt of victory from his mind.&nbsp; His
ardour received a momentary check from the following incident,
which strikingly exemplifies the universal superstition of the
times:&mdash;In preparing for the field, he called for his
favourite sword, when he was informed that he had left it at the
village of Berwick the preceding night.&nbsp; The name of the
place startled him, and heaving a sigh, he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Alas! then, my death is near at hand; for a wizard once
told me that I should not live long after I had been at Berwick,
which I thought was a town in the north so called.&nbsp; Yet, I
will not be cheaply won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The abbot of Shrewsbury and one of the clerks of the privy
seal, were sent by the King to offer pardon to Hotspur if he
would lay down his arms, but to no purpose.&nbsp; Percy completed
all his military arrangements, and stationed his troops in a
field still called the Hateleys&mdash;the royal forces occupying
ground immediately opposite.&nbsp; A flourish of trumpets,
mingling with the contending shouts of &ldquo;St. George and
victory,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Esperance Percy,&rdquo; was the signal
of onset, which was answered by a tremendous discharge of arrows
from both sides.&nbsp; The Scots, who were too impatient to fight
at a distance, rushed with great fury upon the centre of the
royal army, and threw it into disorder; but the King hastening
with fresh succour rallied his broken troops and recovered their
ground.&nbsp; He frequently exposed himself in the thickest of
the battle, which indeed he might the more safely do, since he
had diminished the chances of personal danger, by investing
several of his knights in regal habiliments.&nbsp; Events soon
proved the prudence of the stratagem.&nbsp; Percy sought him in
every part of the field, and Douglas with equal impetuosity slew
three of these mock-monarchs with his own hand.&nbsp; The fight
extended from Berwick westward, to the vicinity of Haughmond
Abbey in the east, and continued for three hours with various
success.&nbsp; The bravery of the King was nobly seconded by the
valour of his son, Prince Henry, who that day performed his
noviciate in arms, and gave earnest of the future glory of
Agincourt.&nbsp; The Scottish champion, seconded by Hotspur, made
another furious attack on the royal station&mdash;slew the
standard bearer, and came within a sword&rsquo;s point of the
king, who fled for his life.&nbsp; In one of these charges
Hotspur <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>was shot through the brain by an arrow, and fell
gloriously in the midst of his foes.&nbsp; Shortly after his army
gave way on all sides, and a total rout ensued.&nbsp; Douglas
fled, and being hotly pursued, he was thrown down from his horse
while taking a desperate leap on Haughmond-hill, and seized by
the enemy.&nbsp; Phillips, the historian, says, &ldquo;1,600
royalists were slain, and 3,000 wounded; on the side of Percy
6,000 were killed, among whom were Lord Percy and most of the
knights and gentlemen of Cheshire; there fell on that day 2,291
men of note.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry having put a period to the
slaughter, halted to return thanks on the field of battle, and
decreed the erection of a collegiate church at Battlefield.&nbsp;
The pious gratitude of the victorious monarch but ill accorded
with the punishment he subsequently inflicted on the
vanquished.&nbsp; The Earl of Worcester, Sir Theobald Trussel,
and Sir Richard Vernon, were executed at the high cross of
Shrewsbury, and their heads exposed to public view on London
bridge.&nbsp; Hotspur&rsquo;s body, which was found among the
slain, was placed between two mill stones, in the market place,
after which it was quartered, and hung on the gates of
Shrewsbury, and other places in the kingdom.&nbsp; The King
released Douglas without ransom, because he feared the Scots
would avenge the death of a man so dear to them, and from similar
motives he afterwards accepted the submission of
Northumberland.</p>
<p>During the contest between the houses of York and Lancaster,
which deluged England with blood, almost to the total extinction
of her ancient nobility, the town of Shrewsbury espoused the
party of the White Rose.&nbsp; In the records of the corporation
is preserved a letter from Richard, Duke of York, requesting the
burgesses to assist him with men in the enterprise he meditated
of removing his rival, Somerset, from power.&nbsp; After his
defeat and death at Wakefield, his son Edward, Earl of March,
went to Shrewsbury, and obtained in its neighbourhood a powerful
levy, which enabled him to revenge his father&rsquo;s cause, in
the great victory of Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross.&nbsp; He was shortly
after proclaimed king.&nbsp; The attachment of the inhabitants,
and the great strength of the town, induced him to choose it as
the asylum for his queen during the subsequent vicissitudes of
the war.&nbsp; Whilst she resided here she had two sons, Richard
and George Plantagenet; the latter died young, and the former,
with his elder brother, Prince Edward, was, according to history,
murdered in the Tower, at the instigation of their uncle, the
Protector.&nbsp; On the usurpation of the crown by Richard III.
his agent, the Duke of Buckingham, deserted him and fled into
Wales, where he took up arms, and endeavoured to excite a general
insurrection against the tyrant whom he had formerly
served.&nbsp; Being abandoned by his followers, he fled in
disguise into Shropshire, and concealed himself in the house of
his steward, who, tempted by the price offered for his
apprehension, betrayed him to John Mytton, sheriff of the
county.&nbsp; He was immediately taken to Shrewsbury, where, by
the king&rsquo;s peremptory order, and without trial, he was
executed on a scaffold erected before the High Cross.</p>
<p>The despotisms of Richard soon alienated the hearts of his
subjects, and disposed them to receive his rival, the Earl of
Richmond, with open arms.&nbsp; That prince, afterwards King
Henry VII., landed at Milford Haven in August, 1485, with a force
of about 2,000 men.&nbsp; The Welsh, who regarded him as their
countryman, flocked to his standard and gave him every assurance
of support.&nbsp; Having mustered his army he determined to march
for Shrewsbury.&nbsp; On arriving at the Welsh bridge, he found
the place in a posture of defence; and on summoning the town he
was unexpectedly refused admittance by the head bailiff; a
curious conference ensued, of which an account is given in a
manuscript belonging to the school library.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
head-bailey Maister Myttoon, being a stout wyse gentilman, on
demand being made of entrance, answered, sayinge that he knew no
kynge but only kynge Richard, whose lyffetenants he and his
fellows were; and before he should entir there, he should go over
his belly, meaning thereby, that he should be slayne to the
ground, and that he protested vehemently on the othe he had
tacken; but on better advice Maister Myttoon permitted the kynge
to pass; but to save hys othe, the sayd Myttoon lay along the
ground, and his belly upwards, and soe the said erle stepped over
hym and saved <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>his othe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The earl was first proclaimed
king on his entrance into Shrewsbury; the inhabitants testifying
their joy at his coming, and their vows for his success.&nbsp; He
is said to have lodged in a house in the Wyle Cop, three doors
below the Lion Inn.&nbsp; In 1488, when quietly established on
the throne, he paid a visit to Shrewsbury, in testimony of his
gratitude for its services to his cause; and in 1490, he, with
his Queen and Prince Arthur, were present at a solemn festival,
and attended mass in the collegiate church of St. Chad.&nbsp;
Five years after, Henry again visited the town, and was nobly
entertained in the castle by the corporation.&nbsp; The spring of
the year 1551 was fatally distinguished by the commencement of a
dreadful epidemic in this town called the &ldquo;sweating
sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the year 1642, the ill-fated Charles I. came hither from
Nottingham, at the head of his army, which was here amply
reinforced and provisioned.&nbsp; The King was joined by Prince
Rupert, Prince Charles, and the Duke of York, and many other
noblemen and gentlemen of the neighbouring counties.&nbsp;
Charles set up a mint here, at which was coined money for his own
use, from the voluntary contributions of plate which were sent by
the inhabitants and others.&nbsp; The corporation about this time
filed a bill in Chancery against Richard Gibbons, late mayor, and
Thomas Challoner, schoolmaster, who kept the keys of the free
school chest, to recover the sum of &pound;600, which they had
surreptitiously taken from the funds of the charity, and lent to
his Majesty.&nbsp; It appears the bill was dismissed without any
relief, but it took the right honourable the Commissioners of the
Great Seal eleven years before they could decide on its
rejection.&nbsp; What, however, of justice was wanting to the
plaintiffs in this cause was made up in assurances of
thankfulness, and gracious promises by the royal receiver, who
had given his note of hand, to refund the money whenever it
should be called for.&nbsp; Some time after the king&rsquo;s
arrival he summoned the gentlemen and freeholders of the county,
and addressed them in the following terms, on a plot of land
called the Soldiers&rsquo; Piece, now converted into a race
course:&mdash;&ldquo;It is some benefit to me, from the insolence
and misfortunes which have driven me about, that they have
brought me to so good a part of my kingdom, and so faithful a
part of my people.&nbsp; I hope neither you nor I shall repent my
coming hither; I will do my part that you may not; and of you I
was confident before I came.&nbsp; The residence of an army is
not usually pleasant to any place, and mine may carry more fear
with it, since it may be thought (being robbed and spoiled of all
my own, and such terror used to fright and keep all men from
supplying me), I must only live upon the aid and relief of my
people.&nbsp; But be not afraid, I would to God my poor subjects
suffered no more by the insolence and violence of that army
raised against me (though they have made themselves wanton even
with plenty), than you shall do by mine.&nbsp; And yet I fear I
cannot prevent all disorders; I will do my best; and this I
promise you, no man shall be a loser by me, if I can help
it.&nbsp; I have sent hither for a mint; I will melt down my own
plate, and expose all my land to sale or mortgage, that if it be
possible, I may not bring the least pressure upon you.&nbsp; In
the meantime, I have summoned you hither to do that for me and
yourselves, for the maintenance of your religion, and the law of
the land (by which you enjoy all that you have) which other men
do against me.&nbsp; Do not suffer so good a cause to be lost,
for want of supplying me with that, which will be taken from you
by those who pursue me with violence.&nbsp; And whilst these ill
men sacrifice their money, plate, and utmost industry to destroy,
be you no less liberal to preserve.&nbsp; Assure yourselves, if
it please God to bless me with success, I shall remember the
assistance that every particular man here gives me to his
advantage.&nbsp; However, it will hereafter (how furiously soever
the minds of men are now possessed) be honour and comfort to you,
that with some charge and trouble to yourselves, you did your
part to support your king and preserve the kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp;
During the king&rsquo;s residence here he kept his court at the
Council House.&nbsp; The Princes Rupert and Morris were stationed
with the army, which exercised in the fields near the Hall.&nbsp;
The king caused the castle gates to be repaired, pulled down many
houses near the castle, and brought the water from the Severn up
to the gate, by means of a draw bridge.&nbsp; He also built a
strong fort at the upper end of Frankwell, in which he planted
cannon.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Sir
Michael Earnley was governor of the castle in 1644, and during
the storming of the town by the parliamentary forces had command
of the garrison.&nbsp; At this time, Colonel Mytton, a soldier of
great valour, was governor of a small garrison at Wem, and
general of Cromwell&rsquo;s army in this county.&nbsp; Having
made two unsuccessful attempts, on the night of the 3rd of
February, he came with his forces consisting of two hundred and
fifty foot, and the same number of horse, and marched towards
Shrewsbury, where they arrived about three o&rsquo;clock on
Saturday morning.&nbsp; Eight carpenters went up the river in a
little boat, and landed within the enemy&rsquo;s breast work,
under the castle hill on the east side.&nbsp; The sentinels,
after some pause fired upon them, but they very soon sawed down
so many of the palasades as gave the men a free passage.</p>
<p>The first that stormed were forty-two troopers dismounted,
with their pistols, and about as many firelocks.&nbsp; They were
led on by Mr. Huson, a puritan preacher, Captain Willers, and
Lieutenant Benbow; then followed some other musqueteers along the
side of the Severn, under the Castle Hill, and entered the town
at the Water-lane Gate; after these marched three hundred and
fifty infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Rinking.&nbsp;
Having entered the streets of the town they marched to the market
place, surprised the guard, and put the captain to death; the
rest marched to the castle Foregate, which was also soon gained;
the guard having basely deserted it.&nbsp; The town being in
possession of the parliamentary forces, they let down the draw
bridge, near the castle, and the horse immediately entered under
the command of Colonel Mytton and Bowyer.&nbsp; It was now about
break of day, and the inhabitants were filled with consternation
and surprise at beholding the enemy in the very heart of the
town, which, on retiring to rest the preceding night, they
thought the most secure in the island.&nbsp; About twelve
o&rsquo;clock the castle after a feeble resistance surrendered,
on condition that the English part of it should march to Ludlow,
but the Irish were delivered up to the conquerors.&nbsp; At the
time of the assault the governor, Sir Michael Earnley, was
confined by sickness to his bed; but waked by the noise of the
tumult, he sprang up at the moment the enemy were rushing into
his chamber, and with great courage refused to submit to the
conquerors, rejecting all quarter, he wantonly perished, covered
more with wounds than with glory.&nbsp; The loss in killed and
wounded was inconsiderable; but the prisoners and property seized
by the victors was of great importance, for here were taken eight
knights and baronets, forty colonels, majors, captains, and
others of quality, besides the common soldiers, also fifteen
pieces of ordnance, several hundred stand of arms and powder,
&amp;c.&nbsp; For these important services the general received
the thanks of parliament, and was made governor of the
castle.&nbsp; The late lieutenant governor was tried by a court
martial at Gloucester, and afterwards hanged, for negligence and
cowardice, in suffering the place to be surprised without his
having made a suitable resistance.&nbsp; Prince Maurice made his
escape before the castle surrendered, but the whole of his
magazine fell into the hands of the victors.</p>
<p>In the contest between the king and the parliament, Colonel
John Benbow, uncle to the celebrated Admiral Benbow, united with
the parliament forces; but afterwards deserted his principles,
and espoused the cause of the monarch.&nbsp; He distinguished
himself by opposing his former associates at the taking of
Shrewsbury, for which vacillating conduct he was condemned by the
parliament, and shot on the green before the castle, October
15th, 1651.&nbsp; At the same time the parliament in order to
strike terror into those who favoured royalty, adjudged the Earl
of Derby to suffer at Bolton.&nbsp; Several other gentlemen of
the first families in England were also sentenced to death at the
same period.&nbsp; An attempt was made to reduce the town to
loyal obedience, after the death of the protector Cromwell, but
the governor of the castle secured the place in the interest of
parliament.</p>
<p>At the restoration, notwithstanding the joy which was diffused
through the kingdom, it is probable there were some in every
county who still sighed for the Commonwealth.&nbsp; The municipal
bodies of the realm, terrified by the example of London, made
haste to surrender the charters they had received from former
monarchs into the hands of the sovereign.&nbsp; The <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>corporation,
however, of Shrewsbury stood out for a twelvemonth.&nbsp; At
length, on the 13th of June, 1684, it was agreed unanimously,
that the charter of the town should be surrendered and yielded up
to his majesty, when his pleasure should require it.&nbsp; On the
20th of August, it was &ldquo;Ordered that the mayor and
committee attend the Lord Chief Justice Jones, to discourse him,
touching the renewing of the charter, and unanimously agreed,
that in the new charter there shall be only twelve aldermen and
twenty-four assistants.&rdquo;&nbsp; The king&rsquo;s death
prevented this instrument from passing the great seal in his
name.&nbsp; Within a week after that event, the corporation sent
up an address to their new sovereign, expressive of &ldquo;their
joyfulness in his succession, and humbly thanking him for his
gracious declaration in preferring the Protestant
religion;&rdquo; no obscure intimation of their wishes on that
momentous subject, which engaged all ranks with an intensity of
interest difficult to be conceived by the present
generation.&nbsp; On the 17th of March, 1684, the corporation
received their new charter, in which the king expresses his
gracious affection for the melioration of the town of Salop, and
hopes that, if the burgesses and inhabitants have more ample
liberties and privileges, they will be the better enabled and the
more bound to render him the more special service.&nbsp; He
grants that the town shall be &ldquo;a free town of itself, and
the burgesses and inhabitants shall be a body corporate, and sue
and be sued; that there shall be one good and discreet man of the
aldermen of the town who shall be mayor; twelve good and discreet
men (the mayor being one) who shall be aldermen; and twenty-four
good and discreet men, assistants.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then follow
various other officers, and a clause empowering the corporation
to supply vacancies occasioned by death, &amp;c.&nbsp; When James
II. made a progress through this part of his dominions, the
corporation resolved to expend &pound;200 in entertaining and
making a present to the king.&nbsp; They despatched two gentlemen
to Gloucester and Worcester for the purpose of ascertaining the
manner in which the royal traveller was entertained in those
cities.&nbsp; They resolved that the conduits should run with
wine on the day of his majesty&rsquo;s entrance, and that the
corporated companies should appear with their drums, colours,
flags, and streamers.&nbsp; The king arrived on the 24th of
August, and took up his abode at the Council House, where the
corporation presented him with a purse of gold containing one
hundred guineas.&nbsp; On the following morning, he exercised the
gift of healing, by touching several persons for the king&rsquo;s
evil.&nbsp; The king issued a proclamation on the 17th of October
for restoring corporations to their ancient charters and
franchises, and orders were the same day made in council for
removing all corporate officers, who had been put in by the crown
since 1679.&nbsp; Richard Mickleston was at this time mayor of
Shrewsbury; under the new charter of 1685 he was discharged from
his office, and John Hill, Esq., elected in his room, under the
charter of 1638.</p>
<p>The various &ldquo;compositions&rdquo; which the burgesses of
Shrewsbury appear to have entered into amongst themselves for the
government of this borough, clearly indicate that a large share
of power was exercised by &ldquo;the commons&rdquo; in its
municipal institutions.&nbsp; The liberties and customs of the
burgesses or commons were confirmed by the charter of Henry II.,
and by various others granted before and after the date of the
compositions alluded to.&nbsp; But the constitution of the
borough was materially altered by a charter of the 14th of
Charles I., transferring to a select body the functions
previously exercised by the commons.&nbsp; This charter continued
to be the governing one till the passing of the new municipal
act, in 1835.&nbsp; The corporation by it was appointed to
consist of a mayor, twenty-four aldermen, and forty-eight
assistants, with an indefinite number of burgesses or freemen,
under the style of the &ldquo;mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of
the town of Shrewsbury, in the county of Salop,&rdquo; instead of
the &ldquo;bailiffs and burgesses,&rdquo; as in the old
charter.&nbsp; The ministerial officers named in the charter
were, the recorder and his deputy, the steward, town clerk, two
coroners, four auditors, two chamberlains, a sword bearer, three
serjeants-at-mace, and three serjeants-yeomen.&nbsp; Exclusive
jurisdiction in the borough was granted, the magistrates being
the mayor and ex-mayor, the bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, the
chancellor of the diocese, the recorder, steward, and three
senior aldermen.&nbsp; Few of them, however, continued <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>to act.&nbsp;
Petty sessions were authorised to be held weekly, quarter
sessions for all criminal actions not capital, a weekly court of
record for all personal suits to any amount, and for ejectments,
and a court leet, with view of frank-pledge.&nbsp; A court of
requests was established in the 23rd of George III. for the
recovery of debts under 40s., which was held every alternate
week.&nbsp; The number of suits in the court in 1839 was
1011.&nbsp; This court has been superseded by the new county
court act.</p>
<p>Under the new municipal act, the borough is included in
schedule A, amongst boroughs to have a commission of the peace,
which has accordingly been granted, and the court of quarter
sessions and recorder re-appointed; and in section I. of that
schedule among those the parliamentary boundaries of which were
to be taken till altered by parliament.&nbsp; The limits of the
borough extend considerably beyond the ancient boundaries, and
now include the whole town and its suburbs.&nbsp; It has been
divided into five wards, and appointed to be governed by ten
aldermen and thirty councillors under the usual corporate
style.&nbsp; The income of the corporation in 1840, was
&pound;1903. 10s. 8d.&nbsp; The income for the year ending
September 1st, 1850, was &pound;3184. 6s. 9d. of which
&pound;515. 11s. 3d. arose from the rental of premises;
&pound;1750. 1s. 11d. from the borough rate; and the remainder
from miscellaneous sources.&nbsp; The principal items of
expenditure for the same period are&mdash;police, &pound;832. 1s.
4d.; salaries, &pound;346. 14s.; rent and taxes, &pound;42. 8s.;
reparations, &pound;187. 6s. 5d.; turns in the quarry and other
annual payments, &pound;267. 19s. 2d.; prosecutions, &pound;217.
19s. 5d.; maintenance and removal of prisoners, &pound;245. 17s.
11d.; expenses at sessions, including fees, &amp;c., &pound;395.
1s. 4d.; inquests and coroners expenses, &pound;72. 4s. 6d.&nbsp;
There was also a balance of &pound;265. 0s. 9d. in the
treasurer&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Shrewsbury has regularly returned
two members to parliament since the reign of Edward I.&nbsp;
Previous to the passing of the reform act the franchise was in
the burgesses inhabiting within the ancient limits of the
borough, paying scot and lot, and not receiving alms or
charity.&nbsp; The county assizes, and quarter sessions, are held
here; petty sessions are held every Tuesday, and the borough
magistrates sit daily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1756, thirty-seven
colliers were brought to gaol for rioting and committing outrages
in the county, it being a time of scarcity for all kinds of
provisions.&nbsp; The trial took place at the spring assizes of
the following year.&nbsp; Ten of the rioters were left for
execution; but the judge sent his report express to the
attorney-general, with an intimation fixed for the day of
execution, and the individuals two in number, who, as he deemed
it should suffer the sentence of the law.&nbsp; The report having
been transmitted to Mr. Pitt, then secretary of state, it lay
there untouched, and was never laid before the king.&nbsp; The
day of execution arrived, without any reprieve, and Mr. Leek, the
deputy sheriff, was advised by several of the principal gentlemen
in the town to leave the prisoners to their fate.&nbsp; But he
was so much shocked at the thought of executing so large a
number, which he was convinced could not be the intention of the
judge, that he ventured to postpone the execution, and sent off
an express to London, on the return of which he had the
satisfaction of finding that his conduct was highly approved of,
and still more, the consciousness that he had saved eight
lives.&nbsp; The following is part of a letter written to him on
the occasion by Lord Chief Justice Willes:&mdash;&ldquo;Till I
saw your letter I was under the greatest uneasiness,&mdash;for I
took it for granted that all the ten rioters had been executed on
Saturday last; and, upon my return from the Home Circuit, on
Thursday last, I found that by a shameful neglect in one of the
secretary of state&rsquo;s officers, no reprieve had been sent
down; and, as it was then too late to send one down, I saw no
reason to hope that their execution would be deferred to a longer
time.&nbsp; But though, to be sure, you have acted contrary to
your duty, you have acted a wise, prudent, and most humane part;
and you have not only my thanks, but the thanks of some of the
greatest men in the kingdom, for the part you have acted on this
occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a letter from Mr. Leek&rsquo;s agent in
town it is stated, &ldquo;My Lord Commissioner Willes was so
afflicted . . . that it really made him ill; and he did not for
two days go into the king&rsquo;s closet, so much he feared the
effect it might have upon the king&rsquo;s mind, if the affair
was communicated to his majesty while it was under that state of
uncertainty.&nbsp; Thank God, your prudent and well judged
respite has prevented all the uneasiness and mischiefs that might
have happened; and I have the pleasure to assure you that no step
was ever taken that has given more satisfaction, than this of
yours has done.&nbsp; My Lord Commissioner Willes waited this day
upon the king with your letter, and has directed me to acquaint
you, by his majesty&rsquo;s orders, that his majesty entirely
approves of what you have done.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHURCHES.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Mary&rsquo;s Church</span> stands in a
commanding position in St. Mary&rsquo;s street, and is one of the
most interesting ecclesiastical edifices in the country.&nbsp;
This fine structure is cruciform, and consists of nave, side
aisles, transept, chancel, two side chapels, and a tower, crowned
with a lofty and beautiful spire.&nbsp; In common with most of
our early churches there is no opportunity of ascertaining the
precise date of its erection; it is said to owe its foundation to
Edgar, who, at the suggestion of Archbishop Dunstan, placed in it
a dean, seven prebends, and a parish priest, with a stipend of
&pound;6. 6s. 8d. per annum.&nbsp; There is, however, every
probability that the foundation was antecedent to his
reign.&nbsp; In the time of Edward the Confessor, this college
possessed a landed estate of about 1300 acres, which it continued
to hold at the Domesday survey, but of which it was soon after
deprived.&nbsp; From a very early period this church enjoyed the
privilege of a royal free chapel, and was therefore exempt from
the jurisdiction of the Bishops.&nbsp; These privileges formed a
frequent <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>ground of contest between the sovereign pontiffs and the
kings of England.&nbsp; A particular instance relates to the
church now under consideration.&nbsp; About the year 1270, the
dean had a dispute with the Abbot of Salop, touching the right of
presentation to the Church of Fittes, or as it was then written,
Fitesho, to which one Robert de Acton had been instituted by the
Bishop of Lichfield, and forcibly ejected by the dean.&nbsp;
Acton, being a crusader, was under the especial protection of the
pope, whose officer called &ldquo;the Executor of the
Cross,&rdquo; sent an order to the Abbot of Shrewsbury to restore
the incumbent to his benefice.&nbsp; This being done the
king&rsquo;s attorney-general filed an information against the
abbot, requiring him to answer &lsquo;whereof he exercised
jurisdiction in the Chapel of Fitesho,&rsquo; appertaining to the
King&rsquo;s Free Chapel of St. Mary, of Salop, which is exempt,
so that neither our lord &ldquo;the pope, nor any other
ecclesiastical judge hath jurisdiction therein.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Judgment passed against the abbot, and he was sentenced to pay
damages to the king and to suffer imprisonment.</p>
<p>The Dean of St. Mary&rsquo;s, had, from time immemorial, the
power of collecting and paying into the king&rsquo;s exchequer,
the tenths or other subsidies arising from the deanery and
prebends.&nbsp; Edward the first confirmed this privilege; and
his grandson, in the eighteenth year of his reign, recognized by
directing the sheriffs of Salop and Hereford not to enter the
jurisdiction of the royal chapel, or to levy a distress on the
possessions thereof, for any subsidies or tenths, unless the dean
should neglect to make a due return.&nbsp; At the dissolution of
collegiate churches 1. of Edward VI., the revenues which
consisted chiefly of tithe, amounted to &pound;42, the greatest
portion of which was granted by that monarch towards the
endowment of the Free Schools.&nbsp; According to Leland it had a
dean and nine poor prebendaries, also vicars choral, two chauntry
priests, a parish priest, and a clerk or assistant.&nbsp; The
peculiar jurisdiction of the Royal Free Chapel remained till the
recent act of parliament restored it to the bishop of the
diocese, and was held in lease at an annual rent of &pound;1. 6s.
8d., of the corporation to whom Queen Elizabeth granted it by
charter, dated 23rd May, 1571.&nbsp; The usual style of the
minister was &ldquo;ordinary and official, principal of the
peculiar and exempt jurisdiction of the Free Royal Chapel of the
Blessed Virgin Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his courts wills were
proved, letters of administration were granted, and all
ecclesiastical matters, arising within the parish and its
subordinate chapelries, adjudicated.&nbsp; In 1632, King Charles
I., during his residence at the council house, attended divine
service here, received the sacraments, and made solemn
protestations of his fidelity to the principles of the reformed
religion.</p>
<p>This venerable edifice exhibits various styles of
architecture: the Anglo-Norman of the 12th century in the
basement of the nave and most of the doors; the lancet style of
the 13th century, in the chancel and transept, and the obtuse
arch of the 15th century in the side aisles and chapels.&nbsp;
The basement of the tower is of red sand stone, and the upper
portion of grey, and in the Anglo-Norman and early pointed styles
of architecture.&nbsp; The dimensions of the church
are&mdash;length from east to west 160 feet&mdash;breadth of nave
and side aisles 53 feet&mdash;transept 90 feet, and height of
tower and steeple 223 feet; the height of the steeple from the
bed of the river 300 feet.&nbsp; The beautifully proportioned
octagonal spire which rises from a tower of noble proportions, is
a conspicuous ornament to the town, and is seen from the adjacent
country to a considerable distance.&nbsp; The nave and side
aisles externally, in the pointed style of the 15th century, are
of the Grinshill free stone, and entered on the north and
south-west by beautiful semi-circular arches, adorned with
chevron, lozenged and foliated mouldings; the south-west porch is
in the Anglo-Norman style, having zigzag mouldings, issuing from
clustered columns, with foliated capitals.&nbsp; On each side is
a small pointed window, exhibiting specimens of the earliest
rudiments of the millioned Gothic architecture, in which has
lately been placed some highly interesting painted glass, of
German execution, on which are depicted various incidents,
chiefly from the Apocrypha.&nbsp; A stone porch, entered by a
pointed arch, had recently been erected before the corresponding
door on the north side.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>The
interior of this venerable edifice is spacious, lofty, and
strikingly noble; the nave is separated from the side aisles by
four semicircular arches, resting on elegant clustered columns,
with foliated capitals of varied and beautiful designs.&nbsp;
Above is a clerestory, which is continued along the walls of the
chancel, lighted by a short double window, bluntly pointed and
bisected by single mullions.&nbsp; The ceiling of the nave is of
panelled oak, richly studded with elegant and exquisitely carved
pendants and foliated bosses, and merits attention not only on
account of its elaborate workmanship, but as being one of the
richest and most highly preserved specimens of its kind now in
existence.&nbsp; A lofty pointed arch, including in its span the
entire breadth of the nave, rises from richly clustered piers,
with foliated capitals, and divides the nave from the ancient
choir.&nbsp; Eastward is a similar arch of like dimensions,
springing from the same pier.&nbsp; From these, the wings of the
transept, corresponding in size, branch off to the north and
south.&nbsp; At each extremity of the transept is a fine triple
lancet window, highly enriched with slender shafts, foliated
capitals, and delicate mouldings, filled with beautiful stained
glass, illustrative of Scripture history; the most prominent
figures are those of Christ, the Virgin Mary, the Apostles and
Evangelists, and an escutcheon of the arms of George III.,
executed by Mr. David Evans, of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The chancel is
elevated above the rest of the church.&nbsp; The ceiling, like
that of the transept, is excellently painted, and adorned with
some of the rich fret work removed from the wreck of the churches
of St. Chad and St. Alkmund.&nbsp; On the north side of the altar
is a beautiful triple lancet window, with arches remarkably
acute, resting on two insulated columns, with capitals adorned
with foliage.&nbsp; This window contains some fine stained glass,
representing the history of the life of St. Bernard.&nbsp; The
great east window occupies the whole extremity of the chancel,
and exhibits the debased style of English architecture of the
Elizabethan era.&nbsp; In this window is the curious and
beautiful ancient stained glass which filled the window of the
old St. Chad&rsquo;s church, prior to its demolition, and which
was presented to this church in 1791.&nbsp; The subject is the
genealogy of Christ from the root of Jesse.&nbsp; Jesse is
represented reclining in sleep, from his loins spring a vine,
which overspreads the whole window, enclosed in his branches the
several kings, his descendants&mdash;the series of which is
finished by the husband of the Virgin Mary in a devotional
posture at the feet of his progenitor.&nbsp; Many of the figures
are depicted with their peculiar emblems, the ground of the whole
is exquisitely beautiful, and the clusters of grapes, and the
bright verdure of the vine leaves, are displayed with great
effect.&nbsp; Underneath is an inscription requesting our prayers
for &ldquo;Mons. John de Charlton, and Dame Hawis, his
companion,&rdquo; from which, and from the armorial bearings, we
learn that this beautiful piece of ancient art was set up by the
great Sir John de Charlton, lord of Powis, and must have been
executed about the middle of the fourteenth century.&nbsp; It has
been conjectured the glass was presented to the grey friars of
this town, to which religious house Sir John and his wife were
great benefactors, and that it was removed to St. Chad&rsquo;s at
the dissolution.&nbsp; This is a singular circumstance of so
fragile a material surviving the destruction of two vast and
substantial edifices.&nbsp; Within the last few years the window
has been judiciously restored.&nbsp; The organ is a powerful and
fine toned instrument, erected by Harris and Byfield, in
1729.&nbsp; By the munificence of the present incumbent, the west
end has been enriched by an elegant organ screen of the most
elaborate workmanship, executed by Mr. John Carline.&nbsp; On the
south side of the chancel is the Trinity or &ldquo;Leybourne
chapel,&rdquo; which communicates with the south transept by a
fine Norman arch, and with the chancel with an arch in the
pointed style.&nbsp; It is said to have been founded about the
year 1300, by one of the Leybournes, of Berwick, as a place of
sepulture for the family, and was subsequently enlarged into its
present form by the Draper&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; In the south
east wall are three stone sedilia, with canopied arches, and near
the north east wall is an altar tomb (probably of Simon de
Leybourne, lord of Berwick, who died between 1300 and 1315), the
sides of which are adorned with canopied niches formerly
containing figures; and on the tomb reclines a figure of a knight
cross-legged, and in chain armour.&nbsp; In this tomb <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>the headless
corpse of Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, who was taken prisoner
at the battle of Shrewsbury, 1403, and beheaded, is believed to
have been interred.&nbsp; Underneath the south window is a neatly
executed gothic monument in memory of Heathcoate Wigram, of
Woodhouse, in the county of Essex; he was a pupil to the Royal
Free Grammar School, of this town, and was drowned whilst bathing
in the Severn, on September 1st, 1838, aged 14 years.&nbsp; The
monument was erected by the masters and pupils in memory of him
whom they loved and lamented.&nbsp; Against the east wall are
monuments to John Jendine, Esq., and Thomas Sutton, Esq., and
between them is the statue of Bishop Butler, erected by his
pupils at the cost of eight hundred guineas.&nbsp; The figure is
full length, sitting in an easy and graceful position, clothed in
the episcopal robes; the right hand hanging over the chair, and
the left hand supporting the head, which is leaning in
thought.&nbsp; The figure is of the purest statuary marble, and
the pedestal which supports the statue of dove coloured marble
from the Clee Hill; it was sculptured by F. H. Baily, Esq.,
R.A.&nbsp; On the north side of the chancel is the vestry,
recently erected in the Norman style, the windows of which are
ornamented with antique German and Flemish glass; immediately
adjoining is the chauntry chapel of St. Catherine; these windows
are also beautified with stained glass, illustrating various
portions of Scripture history.&nbsp; This chapel is now used as a
baptistry, and the ancient stone font, which is beautifully
carved, stands in the centre, on a rich pavement of encaustic
tile.&nbsp; An alabaster slab, against the north wall, engraved
with figures of a warrior and a lady, commemorates Nicholas
Stafford, Esq., and Catherine, his wife, who died in 1643.&nbsp;
A white marble monument, recently erected by subscription, over
the door leading into the vestry, remembers the brave admiral
Benbow, a native of the parish.&nbsp; It represents an obtuse
pyramid of black marble, against which leans an oval medallion
bust of the admiral, surrounded with anchors, flags, and cannon,
and below a delicately sculptured representation in bas relief of
a naval fight.&nbsp; In the north transept is placed a most
beautiful free stone monument to the late Rev. J. B. Blakeway,
which for elegance of design, and beauty of execution, has rarely
been surpassed in modern times; it is upwards of 12 feet in
length and 16 feet in height, and is divided into three
compartments by clustered buttresses, which sustain richly
crocheted pinnacles.&nbsp; The centre compartment comprises a
large pointed arch canopied and crocheted, the back of which is
deeply recessed, and contains the following inscription in
ornamental Roman capitals:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To the Memory of the
Reverend<br />
<span class="smcap">John Brickdale Blakeway</span>, M.A.,
F.A.S.,<br />
Thirty-one years ordinary and official,<br />
And thirty-two years Minister of this Parish.<br />
This Monument is erected<br />
By the voluntary subscription of his parishioners,<br />
As a tribute of respect for his talents,<br />
Esteem for his virtues,<br />
And gratitude for his long and faithful services,<br />
As their friend and pastor.<br />
He died the tenth day of March, <span
class="GutSmall">MDCCCXXVI</span>,<br />
Aged sixty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a preacher, Mr. Blakeway was admired for his forcible
illustration of Holy writ, and the valuable admonitions which his
discourses generally contained.&nbsp; As an author he was known
to the world by the publication of several sermons, and
controversial tracts; and as an historian his name will be
immortalized in the elaborate History of Shrewsbury, which he
commenced in 1820, in conjunction with the venerable Archdeacon
Owen, and just lived to see the general history and
ecclesiastical portions published in two quarto volumes.&nbsp;
There are other memorials, exquisite specimens of monumental
skill, unrivalled in elegance of design and richness of
execution, in various parts of the same edifice, which our limits
will not allow us to notice.&nbsp; On the exterior wall of the
tower are the <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>following quaint verses to the memory of Robert Cadman,
who, on February 2nd, 1793, lost his life in an attempt to
descend from the top of the spire of St. Mary&rsquo;s along a
rope which he had fixed to its highest part, and extended to a
field on the opposite side of the river.&nbsp; In the midst of
his passage the rope broke, as he was passing over St.
Mary&rsquo;s Friars, and he fell lifeless on the ice-bound
earth:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Let this small monument record the name<br />
Of Cadman, and to future times proclaim,<br />
How from a bold attempt to fly from this high spire,<br />
Across the Sabrine stream he did acquire<br />
His fatal end!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas not for want of skill,<br />
Or courage, to perform the task, he fell;<br />
No, no, a faulty cord, being drawn too tight<br />
Hurried his soul on high to take his flight,<br />
Which hid the body here beneath; good night.</p>

<p>The patronage of St. Mary&rsquo;s church is vested in five
trustees, the living is returned at &pound;312, and is enjoyed by
the Rev. W. G. Rowland; the Rev. V. B. Johnstone and T. G. Galway
are the curates.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Chad&rsquo;s Church</span>.&mdash;The
old collegiate church of St. Chad, of which only a small part,
called the Lady Chapel, is standing, occupies the eminence
between College Hill and Belmont.&nbsp; The collegiate
establishment consisted of a dean, ten secular canons, and two
vicars choral; and was founded soon after the subjugation of
Pengwern, in the 8th century, by Offa, King of Mercia, who, as
tradition states, converted the palace of the kings of Powis into
his first church.&nbsp; In the time of Edward the Confessor, this
church held twelve hides of land, which it retained at the
Domesday survey.&nbsp; Subsequently other considerable
possessions were acquired by the college, so that at the
dissolution the yearly revenues amounted to &pound;49. 13s.&nbsp;
The college was dissolved in the 2nd Edward IV., and the crown
leased the collegiate property for a term of twenty-one years,
and a few years afterwards it was appropriated to the Free School
of Shrewsbury, in which it is now vested.&nbsp; Respecting the
various changes which this ancient edifice must have undergone
during a period of nearly 1,000 years, few notices have been
preserved.&nbsp; In the year 1393, a considerable part of it was
consumed by fire, occasioned by the carelessness of a plumber,
who, alarmed at the conflagration, endeavoured to escape over the
ford of the Severn, and was drowned.&nbsp; The damage was so
extensive, that the inhabitants of the town obtained from Richard
II. a remission of certain taxes to enable them to rebuild
it.</p>
<p>In this church, at a very early period, the doctrines of the
Reformation were promulgated.&nbsp; William Thorpe, a priest,
obtained leave in the year 1407 to deliver a sermon before the
principal inhabitants.&nbsp; On this occasion he boldly exposed
the corruptions of the Romish church, in consequence of which the
bailiffs of the town preferred charges of heresy and sedition
against him to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who brought him to
trial.&nbsp; In his examination, he candidly admitted the charges
laid against him, but adhered to his opinions with manly and
unshrinking steadiness, when he was remanded to prison; but of
his subsequent fate we possess no account.&nbsp; The progress of
the Reformation effected a wonderful change in the minds of
men.&nbsp; In the 1st of Edward VI. the bailiffs of Shrewsbury,
whose predecessors had denounced one of its boldest champions as
a heretic, ordered the pictures and superstitious ornaments of
St. Chad&rsquo;s to be publicly burnt; and in the 26th of
Elizabeth, the service of the Church of England was solemnly
established there.</p>
<p>The old church was a majestic edifice, and from its situation,
on a commanding eminence, presented from a distance a
cathedral-like appearance.&nbsp; It was cruciform, with a central
tower, and chiefly in the Anglo-Norman and lancet styles of
architecture, with subsequent additions, having the
characteristics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.&nbsp;
The misfortune which befel this venerable edifice in 1788 is a
striking proof of the <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>mischiefs occasioned by the interment
of the dead in the interior of places of worship.&nbsp; Early in
the year, one of the four pillars, which supported the tower in
the centre of the church, shrunk in so alarming a manner as to
endanger the safety of the fabric.&nbsp; An architect of the town
advised that the whole tower should be taken down, but the parish
vestry, rejecting this advice, employed a mason in the rash
attempt of underbuilding the pillar.&nbsp; The second morning
after the work had commenced, July 9th, when the clock had struck
four, the decayed pillar gave way, the tower was instantly rent
asunder, and falling with its heavy peal of bells on the roof of
the nave and transepts, sunk, with a great part of the building,
in one tremendous crash to the ground.&nbsp; The ruins, on the
following day, presented an awful spectacle; and pews, pulpit,
organ, monuments, and bells, were seen broken and dispersed in a
thousand forms.&nbsp; Among the rubbish were found pieces of
Saxon sculpture, which had probably belonged to the ancient
church, and had been used in the repairs after the calamitous
fire which happened in 1393.&nbsp; Any attempt at rebuilding the
edifice being now deemed inadvisable, the remaining fragments
were taken down, except the Lady Chancel, to prevent further
mischief.&nbsp; The fine stained glass of the west window having
fortunately escaped destruction, was carefully preserved, and
afterwards placed in the chancel of St. Mary&rsquo;s
church.&nbsp; The figure of St. Chad, in his episcopal vestments,
which stood on the summit of the organ, was also preserved, and
is now placed in the vestry of the new church.&nbsp; Such funeral
monuments as could be rescued from the ruins, were placed at the
disposal of the families to whom they belonged, and others were
removed to the chapel before mentioned.&nbsp; This chapel,
originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was rebuilt in 1571, by
Humphrey Onslow, Esq., being the burial place of his family, and
is now solely used for reading the funeral service over those who
are buried in the ancient cemetery.&nbsp; One of the monuments
now removed to the Abbey Church remembered Richard Onslow, an
eminent lawyer, and speaker of the House of Commons in the 8th of
Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; He was the ancestor of Sir Richard,
afterwards Lord Onslow, who filled the chair of the House of
Commons in the 8th of Queen Anne; and also of Arthur Onslow,
Esq., who so ably exercised the office of speaker during many
successive parliaments.&nbsp; There is a small tablet to the Rev.
Job Orton, who was interred in the same grave as Mr. Bryan, a
former minister of this church, who quitted his benefice on the
act of uniformity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The New Church of St.
Chad</span>.&mdash;From the site of the old edifice being deemed
ineligible, the new church was built on a commanding eminence
bordering on the Quarry.&nbsp; It is constructed of the beautiful
white free stone brought from Grinshill.&nbsp; The body of the
church forms a circle one hundred feet in diameter, and
externally consists of a rustic basement, with square windows, on
which reposes a superstructure, containing a series of large
arched windows, between each of which are coupled Ionic
pilasters, resting on the basement and supporting a bold cornice,
crowned with an open balustrade.&nbsp; Attached to the main
edifice is a small circular building with similar enrichments;
and beyond which is the steeple, consisting of three
stories.&nbsp; Upon a square rustic basement rises an octagonal
belfry, enriched with Ionic pilasters, and above, a small cupola
supported on a heavy cylinder, surrounded by eight slender
Corinthian pillars.&nbsp; A heavy cross and vane crowns the
summit.&nbsp; On each side of the tower is a plain square wing,
which are used as vestries.&nbsp; Before the front is a handsome
portico, elevated on a flight of steps, and supported by four
Doric columns.&nbsp; The exterior beauty of this church consists
more in the fineness of its materials, and the splendour of its
ornaments, than in the harmonious proportion and disposition of
its several parts.&nbsp; The interior is handsomely and
conveniently arranged; and though possessing much of the
theatrical air, yet, by the ingenuity of the circular
arrangement, all the congregation can distinctly hear and see the
officiating clergyman.&nbsp; A capacious gallery, ornamented in
front with a handsome balustrade, surrounds the whole church
except the chancel, and reposes on a double row of short pillars
with Ionic capitals.&nbsp; From these a corresponding tier of
slender fluted <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>shafts rises to the ceiling, which is adorned with a
glory in the centre, and a rich cornice of angels and wings
interlaced.&nbsp; The chancel, contrary to general custom, is
towards the north, and is separated from the body of the church
by a handsome arch, springing from an entablature supported by
composite columns, with capitals richly gilt.&nbsp; Over the
chief entrance is a powerful and fine-toned organ, built by Gray,
of London, in 1794, and enlarged and improved in 1848.&nbsp; The
font formerly belonged to the parish of Malpas, and is that in
which the late Bishop Heber was baptized.</p>
<p>The principal monuments are, a handsome panelled marble
tablet, with a fine bust by Chantrey, commemorative of Mr. John
Simpson, an eminent architect, and builder of this church.&nbsp;
A similar tablet and bust, by Chantrey, to William Hazledine,
Esq., the builder of the Menai bridge; an oblong Grecian tablet,
with an elegant latin inscription, to the Rev. Francis Leighton,
his lady, and two grandchildren; and in the vestibule an elegant
marble mural monument to the officers and privates of the 53rd,
or Shropshire Regiment, who were killed on the 10th of February,
1846, in the battles of Subraon, Aliwal, and Loodhiana, on the
Sutluj.&nbsp; The window above the altar is ornamented with
painted glass, representing the descent from the cross, after
Rubens, the Salutation and Representation in the Temple, executed
by Mr. Evans, of this town, whose skill has also been exercised
in four other windows of this church, of which the subjects are,
the raising of Lazarus, Christ receiving little children, healing
of the sick, and the tribute money, the whole of which were
presented by the Rev. R. Scott.&nbsp; The church was commenced
building March 2nd, 1790, and consecrated August 20th, 1792;
there is accommodation for a congregation of 2200 persons.&nbsp;
The total cost, including site, organ, and bells,
&pound;19,352.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, returned at
&pound;350, in the patronage of the Lord Chancellor; incumbent,
Rev. John Yardley, M.A.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church of the Holy Cross</span>,
commonly called the <i>Abbey Church</i>, is situated in the Abbey
Foregate.&nbsp; It is built of red sand stone, and consists of
nave, side aisles, and a massive tower at the west end.&nbsp;
Though the beauty of the church has suffered both from
dilapidation and mutilation, yet it displays many interesting
features of ancient Norman architecture, combined with the
earlier pointed style.&nbsp; It originally formed part of the
richly endowed monastery founded by Roger de Montgomery, the
first Earl of Shrewsbury, and was built on the site of a small
wooden church dedicated to St. Peter, which it is said was
erected in the time of Edward the Confessor, by Siward, a Saxon
gentleman, then resident in Shropshire.&nbsp; The nave or great
western aisle, was in very early times appropriated to the use of
the neighbouring inhabitants, who were in general servants of the
Abbey.&nbsp; It was called the Parish Church of the Holy Cross,
within the monastery of St. Peter&rsquo;s, of Salop.&nbsp; For
this reason it was spared in the general destruction of the
Abbey, and being now one of the parochial churches of the town,
retains the name of Holy Cross.&nbsp; When entire it was a
stately cruciform building, equal in size to some of our
cathedrals, but two-thirds of the structure was destroyed at the
dissolution of monasteries in the time of Henry VIII.&nbsp; The
principal entrance is at the west end under the tower, through a
pointed doorway, with mouldings skilfully inserted within a
deeply recessed semi-circular arch, the exterior rib of which
springs on each side from a Norman pillar, with indented
capital.&nbsp; Above this rises a magnificent and elegantly
proportioned window, divided horizontally by embattled transoms,
and perpendicularly by six upright mullions into seven
compartments; the arched head is gracefully pointed and filled
with a profusion of the most delicate tracery.&nbsp; On each side
of the window is a canopied niche, containing statues of St.
Peter and St. Paul, the tutelar saints of the Abbey.&nbsp; The
nave is separated from the side aisles by the semi-circular
arches, resting on short mosaic pillars in the Anglo-Norman
style.&nbsp; The western portion has two pointed arches in the
Gothic style, rising from clustered pillars, with capitals
composed of small horizontal mouldings; a lofty and graceful arch
opens from the nave of the tower, and affords a view of the fine
west window, the upper part of which is filled with armorial
bearings.&nbsp; The <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>fine eastern window filled with stained glass was
executed by Evans, of Shrewsbury, with his usual taste.&nbsp;
Underneath this window is a beautifully executed stone altar
screen, composed of an arcade of five Norman arches, with varied
mouldings, surrounded by a pierced balustrade.&nbsp; The
communion table is fenced by stone railing uniform in style, the
whole of which was designed and executed by Messrs. Carline and
Dodson, of this town, through the liberality of the late Rev. R.
Scott.&nbsp; The north east window of the north aisle contains a
figure of St. Peter, the arms of the see of Lichfield, of Lord
Berwick, the donor, and of thirteen incumbents since the
reformation.&nbsp; In the south aisle is a beautiful mosaic
window of stained glass, containing the armorial bearings, of the
families connected with the Rev. John Roche.&nbsp; At the west
end of the church is a spacious gallery, and an excellent organ,
erected in 1806, at the cost of 365 guineas.</p>
<p>There are several ancient monuments which have been removed
hither on the demolition of other sacred edifices in the town and
county, which are preserved in the ample side aisles.&nbsp; The
oldest in the church is in the south aisle, a mutilated figure of
a warrior in the costume of the reign of King John, and supposed
to represent the founder of the Abbey, Earl Roger de Montgomery,
who died in the year 1094.&nbsp; In the north aisle is the
recumbent figure of a person in the robes and coif of a judge
brought from St. Chad&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the south aisle is a
monument brought from St. Giles&rsquo;s church, with a figure in
priestly vestments.&nbsp; Opposite the last is the effigy of a
knight in linked armour, removed from the priory church of
Wombridge, conjectured to commemorate Sir Walter de Dunstanville,
who died in the 25th of Henry III., 1240.&nbsp; In the south
aisle an alabaster altar tomb, bearing the recumbent figures of a
man (in the habiliments of war) and his wife, remembers William
Charlton, who died in 1524.&nbsp; This monument was originally
erected in Wellington church.&nbsp; An altar tomb in the north
porch, in the style of the fifteenth century, has a figure of a
knight in plate armour, partly covered with a monastic dress, and
another figure in the dress of a hermit of the Romish
church.&nbsp; Near the east end of the north aisle, is a large
altar tomb with full length figures, to the memory of Richard
Onslow, Esq., speaker of the House of Commons, in the 8th of
Elizabeth, who died 1571, and his lady.&nbsp; This memorial was
formerly placed in the chancel of old St. Chad&rsquo;s
church.&nbsp; Above this is a mural monument brought from St.
Chad&rsquo;s, representing a gentleman in a ruff, and a lady with
long veil thrown back, kneeling under two arches; above, a lady
in a habit and coif, and a little girl kneeling, to the memory of
Thomas Edwardes, Esq., who died 1634, and of Mary, the wife of
his son, Thomas Edwardes, Esq., who died 1641.&nbsp; In the south
aisle is an alabaster altar tomb, in the Grecian style, bearing
the figure of an alderman in his civic robe, and a lady in the
scarlet gown formerly worn by the lady mayoresses of Shrewsbury,
commemorative of William Jones, Esq., who died 1612, and his
wife, who died in 1623.&nbsp; The monument was originally placed
in St. Alkmund&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; There are numerous other
mural monuments, of more modern dates, which are elegantly
designed, in memory of deceased members of some of the principal
families of the parish.&nbsp; In the vestry is an old painting of
the Crucifixion, which in 1728 occasioned much strife between the
minister and his flock.&nbsp; In that year Mr. Latham, who had
been lately inducted to the vicarage, presented a petition to the
Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, praying that a picture
representing our Saviour upon the cross might be removed out of
the church.&nbsp; A counter petition was also presented by the
parishioners, but the wardens shortly after received an order
from the bishop for the removal of the picture.&nbsp; It was
afterwards long possessed by the family of Hilton, by whom it was
again restored to the parishioners of the Holy Cross.&nbsp; The
living is a vicarage with St. Giles annexed, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;8.&nbsp; The small tithes are
commuted for &pound;363, and the impropriator, Lord Berwick,
receives &pound;110.&nbsp; The patronage is vested in the Right
Hon. Lord Berwick, who received it in exchange for three small
livings in Suffolk; incumbent, Rev. Robert L. Burton, M.A.&nbsp;
The vicarage of the Holy Cross is a small fabric of wood and
plaster situated in the Abbey Foregate, now <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>converted
into two cottages.&nbsp; From time immemorial certain lands have
been vested in the churchwardens and their successors; they now
produce an income of &pound;250 per annum.&nbsp; &ldquo;The vicar
and churchwardens are a corporation with power of making leases
of the landed possessions, &amp;c., and have a common seal which
is appended to such documents.&nbsp; The seal is kept in a chest
secured by three locks, and the keys are severally in the
possession of the vicar and two churchwardens.&nbsp; It is of
brass of the <i>visica piscis</i> form, and has in the centre a
baton or mace, and on each side a clothed arm projecting towards
the centre, that on the dexter side holding a pastoral crook,
that on the sinister side a naked sword; the ground work studded
with stars, and around the margin this
inscription:&mdash;S.COMMVNE DE FFORYATE MONACHOR.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The space of ground on the east side of the church, containing
7300 yards, whereon formerly stood the choir and Lady Chapel of
the monastery, was in 1840 converted into a public cemetery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church of St. Giles</span> stands at
the eastern extremity of the suburb of the Abbey Foregate, the
living of which is annexed to that of Holy Cross.&nbsp; It is a
small plain building consisting of nave, chancel, and north,
aisle, with a small bell turret at the west end.&nbsp; Of its
foundation we possess no record, but the structure is doubtless
as old as the early part of the twelfth century, and some
confirmation is afforded to this conjecture by the arches of the
northern and southern doors, having the characteristics of that
era.&nbsp; The nave is divided from the side aisle by three
pointed arches, sustained on plain round pillars.&nbsp; It is
highly probable that the north aisle was made for the
accommodation of persons afflicted with leprosy&mdash;the
hospital of which formerly stood near the church, and from which
they had access by a pointed doorway, when they might hear the
offices of religion without endangering other worshippers with
their contagious malady.&nbsp; A lofty pointed arch separates the
nave from the chancel, which is terminated by a flat arched
eastern window, which is exquisitely beautified with stained
glass, executed by Mr. Evans.&nbsp; The four lower compartments
have full length figures of the Evangelists, standing upon
hexagonal pedestals.&nbsp; Over each figure is a beautiful canopy
of tabernacle work, and the intersections of the tracery contain
the symbols of the Evangelists.&nbsp; In the three principal
compartments of the upper division, are fine representations of
the salutation, the wise men&rsquo;s offering, and the
presentation in the temple.&nbsp; The small lancet window on the
north side, contains a figure of the patron saint, St. Giles,
exquisitely executed.&nbsp; On the floor are several ancient
stones bearing crosses, probably denoting the interment of some
of the masters of the old hospital.&nbsp; From an entry in the
parish registrar of the date 1655, it appears this church
formerly possessed a steeple at the west end.&nbsp; In the
steeple was a great bell and two smaller ones, which were taken
down in 1672, and used in the following year, with four lesser
bells, and the great &ldquo;Wenefrede bell,&rdquo; in the
recasting of the present ring of bells in the Abbey church.&nbsp;
For a long period this venerable edifice exhibited a rude
appearance of damp and neglect, and divine service was celebrated
only on two Sunday evenings during the year.&nbsp; In 1827,
however, the Rev. W. G. Rowland, the liberal donor of the
beautiful east window, thoroughly repaired and happily rescued it
from the ruin and decay to which in its previous condition it was
fast hastening.&nbsp; Subsequently the massive oak benches were
removed, and replaced with new ones; a new pulpit and altar
screen of oak, beautifully carved in unison with the architecture
were added, and the whole building fitted up for divine service
by the munificence of the Rev. Richard Scott, who also gave
&pound;500 towards augmenting the salary of the officiating
minister.&nbsp; Since June, 1836, divine service has regularly
been performed on the Sabbath.&nbsp; The Rev. Joseph Simpson,
M.A., is the officiating minister.&nbsp; In the parish book is
the following memorandum:&mdash;&ldquo;1585, paid Barnett and his
sonne for pulling down the crosse of St. Gyles, xviij
d.&rdquo;&nbsp; This cross formerly stood in the church yard, and
was curiously sculptured.&nbsp; A large stone which now lies in
the church yard, with a cavity on the upper side, was most
probably the base and socket of the cross.&nbsp; It is now termed
the <i>pest basin</i>, which tradition states to have been <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>used during
the time of the plague for holding water, in which to avoid the
spread of the disease the people deposited their money in their
bargains for provisions with the country folk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Alkmund&rsquo;s Church</span>,
situated in St. Alkmund&rsquo;s Square, is a neat structure of
freestone, erected in 1795, with the exception of the tower and
spire, which fortunately escaped the fate of a former edifice,
inconsiderately destroyed under a mistaken apprehension of its
stability.&nbsp; The original church was founded by Ethelfleda,
daughter of Offa, King of Mercia, who governed that kingdom at
the beginning of the ninth century.&nbsp; King Edgar, by the
advice of St. Dunstan, gave other lands and possessions, and
placed here a dean and ten prebends.&nbsp; Its patron saint was a
prince of the Northumbrian family, who is said to have been
buried at Lilleshall.&nbsp; At the Doomsday survey, this church
had possession of nine manors, in all about 4,020 acres, out of
which 620 were in demesne, and a rent of &pound;8. 8s. 8d.,
which, with other rents, produced a revenue of &pound;500 per
annum.&nbsp; The manner in which it lost this appendage, as
recorded in Dugdale, is an example of the fluctuations to which,
in those days of turbulence, even the most sacred property was
liable.&nbsp; King Edward the Confessor wrested these lands from
one Spirtes, a canon of St. Alkmund&rsquo;s, and gave them to
Godfrey Wiffesune.&nbsp; On his death, about two years after the
conquest, Nigel, an ecclesiastic, obtained them.&nbsp; After his
decease, one Gilbert de Cundore, a layman, had possession of
them, and retained them till he was excommunicated by the
bishop.&nbsp; In order to obtain absolution, he and his knights
submitted to do penance, and were flogged by the canons at the
altar of St. Alkmund&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; The property finally
centred in Roger, Earl of Hereford, who held it by force of
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The superior and dean of this collegiate church had, in
common with those of other Saxon foundations, the right of
hereditary succession, and even claimed a privilege of alienating
the property to other than religious uses.&nbsp; In the year
1150, when monastic institutions were universally popular, and
the colleges of the secular clergy had fallen into disrepute,
Richard de Belesme, then dean of St. Alkmund&rsquo;s, voluntarily
surrendered the estates of the deanery, which lay at Lilleshall,
towards the endowment of an abbey of canons regular of St.
Augustine, about to be erected on that spot made sacred by the
sepulchre of the patron saint of his church; and so great was his
zeal for this new institution, that he solicited and obtained the
consent of the Pope and King Stephen for dissolving the college
entirely, and for transferring all its estates to the new
abbey.&nbsp; Thus stripped of all its landed property, the
benefice sank from a collegiate establishment to a poor vicarage,
which continued in the patronage of the monks of Lilleshall till
the dissolution, when it became vested in the crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old church was a spacious structure, exhibiting various
styles of architecture, from the Anglo-Norman period to the
middle of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; Of its antiquity, however,
few features remain; for the panic caused by the sudden fall of
St. Chad&rsquo;s church, induced the parishioners of St. Alkmund
to petition parliament to pull down the body of the old church,
and erect a new one on its site.&nbsp; The modern building is in
the ancient pointed style of architecture; an oblong square,
eighty-two feet by forty-four feet, with a recess for the
altar.&nbsp; The ancient tower, terminated with crochetted
pinnacles, remains, and is seventy feet high, surmounted with a
chaste and elegantly proportioned spire, one hundred and fourteen
feet&mdash;making a total of 184 feet from the ground.&nbsp; Over
the altar is a window of painted glass, executed about fifty
years ago by Eginton, representing Evangelical Faith, in a female
figure as large as life kneeling on a cross, with the eyes
elevated and the arms extended towards a celestial crown, which
appears amidst the opening clouds, This window was erected at a
cost of two hundred guineas.&nbsp; The church is handsomely
fitted up, and will accommodate a congregation of 800
persons.&nbsp; Upon the gallery, at the west end, is a good
organ, erected by subscription in 1823.&nbsp; The tower contains
a peal of eight bells, recast in 1813.&nbsp; The sound of church
bells was supposed to be very efficacious in chasing away the
spirit of darkness by our superstitious ancestors.&nbsp; <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>The following
curious notice will shew that they were not at all times proof

<p>Of the ancient tombs and mural monuments which abounded in the
old edifice, none were preserved in the present structure worthy
of notice, with the exception of a tablet to Chief Justice Jones,
who died in 1692.&nbsp; Several tablets of a modern date adorn
the walls.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;6, now returned at &pound;219.&nbsp;
Patron, the Lord Chancellor; incumbent, the Rev. Charles Edward
Leopold Wightman, M.A.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Julian&rsquo;s Church</span> is
situated upon elevated ground, at the top of the Wyle-cop, near
to St. Alkmund&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; Of its early foundation in
Saxon times we possess no particulars.&nbsp; It was distinguished
through several reigns as a rectory and a royal free chapel, with
a peculiar jurisdiction.&nbsp; According to Tanner, at a very
early period it was annexed to the free chapel of St. Michael,
within the castle, and so continued until the reign of Henry IV.,
when they were both resigned into the king&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;
Subsequently, the rectory was granted, among other things, to
augment the new foundation of Battlefield College, and
thenceforth the living became a mere stipendiary curacy.&nbsp; On
the dissolution of that college, the living was granted by the
crown to John Capper and Richard Trevor; and after many
subsequent transfers, passed into the family of Prince, from whom
it has descended to the present patron, the Earl of
Tankerville.</p>
<p>The present church, built in 1749 on the site of a former
edifice, which had become ruinous, is an oblong structure in the
Grecian style, consisting of nave, chancel, and side aisles, with
a tower at the west end.&nbsp; This tower is the only existing
portion of the old church which remains, and is crowned with
eight crochetted pinnacles.&nbsp; It has an excellent illuminated
clock; and a peal of six bells, which were recast in 1706.&nbsp;
The interior has a handsome appearance: four Doric pillars on
each side the nave support the ceiling, which is carved and
decorated with the fret-work of the old church.&nbsp; Over the
side aisles and west end are commodious galleries, in the latter
of which is a superior organ, erected by subscription in
1834.&nbsp; The east window contains a figure of St. James, in
ancient stained glass, which was purchased from a splendid
collection brought from Rouen in 1804.&nbsp; Several of the other
windows are ornamented with armorial bearings.&nbsp; There is
only one monument of any antiquity: a coarse marble slab,
inscribed in Longobaric capitals to a member of the Trumwin
family.&nbsp; Among the memorials of a modern date is one to the
memory of Mr. John Allatt, the benevolent founder of
Allatt&rsquo;s Free School.&nbsp; The south aisle contains a neat
memorial, of the Grinshill freestone, to commemorate the
liberality of the late Rev. Richard Scott, B.D., who expended
upwards of &pound;1,500 in the reparations of this church, and
other improvements connected with the fabric.&nbsp; It contains
the following inscription, dated 1847, in reference to the
improvements made by Mr. Scott: &ldquo;Who, in Christian love,
and a desire to honour God with his substance, has caused an
effective architectural character to be given to the exterior of
the south side of this sacred edifice, which, from the limited
funds raised for its re-edification in 1750, necessarily induced
brick as a material, and a design possessing little claim to
taste; stone piers are now set at each end of the building and
between the lower windows, which have been lengthened.&nbsp;
Above, on a block cornice, are Roman Doric pilasters which
sustain an entablature, crowned by an open balustrade and
vase-shaped acroteria.&nbsp; Fretted console tables have been
added to the upper windows, the architecture entirely renewed,
and, like those below, re-glazed with metallic frame-work.&nbsp;
A new portal and door at the eastern end of the south aisle, and
the surface of this portion of the church and chancel, covered
with stucco; the apex of the gable being finished with an
appropriate ornament.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>In the
north aisle is a similar memorial, inscribed to the same
individual for his munificent beneficence &ldquo;In erecting an
ornamental stone wall and parapet round the church-yard, flagging
the foot-path underneath and that on the eastern side, and
likewise along the basement of the church, renewing the steps at
the south-east thoroughfare, and lowering, repairing, and
enclosing those which form the main approach from the street to
the cemetery; also for a new pavement in the area leading to and
from before the south door, rebuilding the steps of the portico
with the addition thereto of a continuous pedestal, painting the
north side of the church, and cleaning the stone work, roofing
the chancel, and placing thereon a stone cornice and blocking
course, with a foliated cone at each angle, as well as for other
useful improvements connected with the fabric.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
living of St. Julian&rsquo;s is a perpetual curacy, returned at
&pound;159, in the patronage of Earl Tankerville, and incumbency
of the Rev. James Jardine Rogerson, M.A.&nbsp; The chapel of Ford
was formerly an appendent of this church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. George&rsquo;s Church</span>, situated
at Frankwell, is a neat cruciform structure, in the Gothic style,
with a short tower at the west end, ornamented with four
pinnacles.&nbsp; It is built of the beautiful Grinshill
freestone, from a design by Mr. Haycock.&nbsp; The cost was
nearly &pound;4,000, raised by voluntary subscription.&nbsp; It
was consecrated for divine service on January 30th, 1832.&nbsp;
The interior has a chaste and elegant appearance, and will
contain a congregation of 750 persons.&nbsp; Of the sittings, 460
are free and unappropriated.&nbsp; By the liberality of the late
Rev. Richard Scott, B.D., the chancel has been beautified with an
altar screen, the gallery with a small organ, and the triple
lancet windows filled with splendid stained glass.&nbsp; The
centre window contains a full-length figure of Isaiah, clothed in
a brilliant vest of purple, over which is thrown a green robe
lined with ermine, denoting his royal descent.&nbsp; The windows
on each side have spirited figures of St. Matthew and St.
Mark.&nbsp; The former exhibits deep and serious meditation, and
holds a manuscript in his left hand; and the latter, a venerable
figure, is pointing to an open gospel, which he holds in his left
hand.&nbsp; The windows in the north and south transepts are also
embellished with glass of a rich and elaborate mosaic pattern,
which contributes to the imposing effect of the splendid east
window.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, returned at
&pound;118, in the patronage of the vicar of St. Chad; incumbent,
the Rev. John Harding, M.A.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Michael&rsquo;s Church</span>,
situated in the populous suburb of Castle Foregate, is a neat
brick structure, in the Grecian style of architecture, consisting
of nave, side aisles, and elliptical recess for the communion,
with an octagonal tower in three divisions, rising to the height
of seventy feet, over the side aisles are galleries which are
free; there is also a spacious gallery in the west end for the
use of the school children, in which stands a small organ the
gift of the Rev. W. G. Rowland, M.A.&nbsp; The pulpit and reading
desk are octagonal, and placed on opposite sides of the church;
the roof is panelled in large square compartments, and painted in
imitation of oak.&nbsp; Three windows of stained glass which
decorate the chancel are the exquisite productions of Mr. David
Evans.&nbsp; The centre one is illustrative of the Nativity, from
the celebrated &ldquo;La Notte&rdquo; of Correggio.&nbsp; The
windows on each side represent the Annunciation, and the
Presentation in the Temple; the former from a picture by Guido,
and the latter from a celebrated painting by Rubens.&nbsp; These
windows were the gift of the Rev. W. G. Rowland, M.A., to whose
liberality the parishioners are also indebted for the service of
communion plate, the peal of six bells, which hang in the tower,
and the erection of the adjacent school rooms, for the education
of the poor children of this populous portion of the parish of
St. Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The church was erected at an expense of
&pound;2000, raised by subscription, and consecrated on the 24th
August, 1830, as a chapel of ease to St. Mary&rsquo;s
church.&nbsp; The edifice contains 800 sittings, of which 600 are
free and unappropriated.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church of the Holy Trinity</span>,
situated on the Meole-road, was erected in 1837, for the
accommodation of the inhabitants of the populous suburb of
Coleham.&nbsp; It was built <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>at a cost of nearly &pound;1900,
raised by subscription, aided by the grant of &pound;600, from
the Lichfield Diocesan Society, and a further grant of
&pound;150, from the Incorporated Church Building Society.&nbsp;
The structure is a neat fabric of brick with a short tower; the
body of the church has five windows on each side, and an
elliptical recess for the communion, separated, internally, from
the nave by a circular arch.&nbsp; The church contains 812
sittings, of which 504 are free.&nbsp; The window over the altar
contains beautifully executed figures in stained glass, of the
Evangelists, and St. Peter and St. Paul; several of the other
windows are beautified with scriptural medallions, in stained
glass, which together with a handsome service of communion plate,
were presented by the late Rev. Richard Scott, B.D.&nbsp; This
place of worship was formed into a district parish church in
1841.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy enjoyed by the Rev.
James Colley, M.A.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ancient Chapels</span>.&mdash;Several
ancient chapels formerly stood in various parts of the town, the
most considerable of which seems to have been the collegiate
chapel of <span class="smcap">St. Michael</span>, within the
castle.&nbsp; No vestige of its site now remains, though it
probably existed, at least in a ruinous state, in the reign of
James II., for, it appears at that time, an order was made by the
corporation, &ldquo;that enquiry should he made after the stones
taken away from the ruins of St. Michael&rsquo;s chapel within
the castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Part of the <span class="smcap">Chapel
of St. Nicholas</span>, on the left hand entrance to the council
house, is still standing; it is of the early Norman era, and most
probably was built by the first Norman, Earl of Shrewsbury, for
the use of such of his retainers as resided in the outer works of
the castle.&nbsp; The only portions of this edifice at present
remaining are the nave, a massive arch formerly opening into the
chancel, and two similar side arches.&nbsp; The building is now
converted into a stable.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">St.
Catherine&rsquo;s Chapel</span> is stated to have occupied an
elevated site upon Coton-hill.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene</span>, a site near
Trinity Church.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">St. Blase&rsquo;s
Chapel</span> was situated in the Murivance.&nbsp; A tea garden
near the site of the Belle-vue, was formerly called the
Hermitage.&nbsp; These and other ecclesiastical edifices which
once adorned this eminent town, have now disappeared; yet their
faint traces still afford matter of interesting speculation for
the antiquary.</p>
<h3>DISSENTING CHAPELS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The Presbyterian Chapel</span>, situated
in High-street, as the first dissenting place of worship
established in the town, claims our first attention.&nbsp; To the
act of uniformity, which, on St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s day, 1662,
drove from their livings upwards of two thousand clergymen of the
church of England, Shrewsbury is indebted for its first
dissenting church.&nbsp; It was formed by the Rev. John Bryan,
M.A., and the Rev. Francis Tallants, M.A., ejected from the
livings of St. Chad&rsquo;s and St. Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Their
meetings were first held in the house of Mrs. Hunt, and after
experiencing various alternations of suffering and indulgence
during the unsettled times that followed the act of uniformity,
in 1683 their meetings were suppressed, and these eminent
preachers of the gospel were forced into obscurity.&nbsp; On King
James II. allowing liberty to Dissenters to meet for worship,
they assembled as before in Mrs. Hunt&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; In
1691, they built a chapel in High-street, and Mr. Tallants caused
the following (with the latter sentence the Hugonists, of France,
usually began their worship,) to be painted on the
walls:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>This place was not built for a faction or
a party</i>, <i>but to promote repentance and faith in communion
with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in
sincerity</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Our help is in the name of the
Lord who made heaven and earth</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The year
1715 was particularly unfortunate for Protestant Dissenters; mobs
and riots arose in various places, particularly in Lancashire,
Shropshire, and Staffordshire&mdash;among the chapels pulled down
in Shropshire were those of Wem, Whitchurch, and
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The chapel, in High-street, was soon after
rebuilt by the government, and the liberties of Dissenters
confirmed and fixed upon a solid foundation.&nbsp; In 1839 the
venerable chapel was almost entirely taken down, owing to the
building being considered unsafe, and because the commissioners
under the street act required a part of the premises.&nbsp; It
was rebuilt nearly <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>on the old site, and re-opened for public worship in
July, 1840.&nbsp; The interior has a simple and primitive
appearance, the fittings are of old oak; there is accommodation
for about 300 worshippers.&nbsp; The Rev. Richard Astley has been
the respected pastor of the congregation since the year
1831.&nbsp; For a more extended and very pleasing account of this
place of worship, we beg to refer our readers to the
&ldquo;History of the Presbyterian Meeting House of
Shrewsbury,&rdquo; published by the present minister in 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span>, situated on
Swan-hill, had, its origin in some unhappy disputes which arose
in the congregation worshipping in High-street chapel, relative
to the invitation of a minister being invited to settle among
them.&nbsp; The chapel is a substantial brick edifice, with a
neatly furnished interior, and contains six hundred
sittings.&nbsp; On a stone tablet in the front is the following
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;This building was erected in the year
1767, for the public worship of God, and in defence of the rights
of majorities in Protestant Dissenting congregations, to choose
their own ministers.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a cemetery adjoining
the chapel.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Weaver has been the pastor of
the congregation worshipping here for 52 years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span>,
Castle-gates, a handsome building of free stone, is the most
imposing structure in connection with the nonconformists in the
town of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It was erected in 1845, at a cost
(including the site) of &pound;3000.&nbsp; The interior has a
very chaste, and beautiful appearance; it will hold six hundred
persons.&nbsp; The Rev. Edward Hill is the minister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Catholic Chapel</span> is situated in
Beeche&rsquo;s-lane, near the southern portion of the town
walls.&nbsp; It is a neat building erected in 1776, and enlarged
in 1825; the front is stuccoed, and surmounted by a plain
cross.&nbsp; The interior has a tasteful and elegant appearance;
the altar rests on a sarcophagus, on the front of which is a
painting of the last supper, above is a figure of Christ on the
cross.&nbsp; On the gallery is a small organ, and on each side
the entrance an elegant marble shell for the holy water.&nbsp;
The chapel will hold about three hundred worshippers.&nbsp; The
Rev. Eugene Egan is the priest.&nbsp; A plot of land, extending
from Belmont to the southern walls, has been purchased, with the
intention of erecting a new Catholic church, on a scale
commensurate with the wants of an increasing congregation.&nbsp;
The Catholics formerly met for worship in an upper room of an old
house in St. Alkmund&rsquo;s-square.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Baptist Chapel</span>, situated in
Claremont-street, a plain brick building, was opened for divine
worship in 1780, and enlarged in 1810.&nbsp; A society of this
persuasion is stated to have existed in this town, in the time of
the Commonwealth.&nbsp; In the chapel is a small memorial, of Mr.
Palmer, who was pastor of the congregation for twenty-seven
years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel</span> is a
commodious building, on St. John&rsquo;s-hill, erected in 1804,
and subsequently enlarged and decorated.&nbsp; It is neatly
fitted up, and surrounded with galleries, in which is a small
organ.&nbsp; It is calculated to hold 700.&nbsp; The Methodists
have also small places of worship in the Castle Foregate and
New-street, Frankwell.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wesleyan New Connexion Chapel</span>,
(<span class="smcap">Ebenezer</span>,) situated at Tower-place,
is a handsome building, having two entrances, with a Doric
portico to each.&nbsp; The cost of the structure was &pound;1500,
and it was opened for divine worship, June 13th, 1834.&nbsp; The
interior has a light and pleasing appearance; it is without
galleries; in the centre of the chapel are two rows of pews, with
a row on each of the sides, which ascend gradually from the
floor; the blank walls display arches and pilasters, supporting a
frieze and cornice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Friends&rsquo; Meeting House</span>, a
plain brick structure, in a retired situation, on St.
John&rsquo;s-hill, is fitted up with much simplicity and
neatness.&nbsp; It was erected in 1746, and enlarged in 1807.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Welsh Calvinistic Chapel</span>, a
brick structure, erected on the site of a former edifice, is
situated in Hill&rsquo;s-lane.&nbsp; It is calculated to
accommodate about 400, and was opened for divine worship in
December, 1826.&nbsp; The Dissenters of this persuasion have also
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>a small
chapel, situated in the Wagon and Horses passage,
Pride-hill.&nbsp; The service in both these chapels is in the
Welsh language.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Primitive Methodists</span> have a
place of worship to accommodate about four hundred, situated in
Castle-court.&nbsp; They have also a small chapel, at the Old
Heath.</p>
<h3>SCHOOLS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The Royal Free Grammar School</span>,
situated near the Castle gates, is a noble institution for the
education of youth, founded by King Edward VI., in 1552, and
endowed with the greater portion of the revenues of the two
dissolved colleges of St. Mary and St. Chad.&nbsp; Queen
Elizabeth greatly augmented the endowment, in 1571, by adding the
rectory of Chirbury, with additional tithes and estates in St.
Mary&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; The structure is large and lofty, and
occupies two sides of a quadrangle, with a square pinnacled tower
at the angle, partly rebuilt in 1831.&nbsp; The original school
was of timber, and the present tower, chapel, and library, were
added in 1595.&nbsp; The wooden building was taken down in 1630,
and its place supplied by the present stately edifice of
Grinshill free stone.&nbsp; In the centre is a gateway, adorned
on each side by a rude Corinthian column, supporting statues of a
scholar and a graduate bareheaded, in the costume of the
times.&nbsp; Over the arch is an inscription in Greek, importing
that a love of literature is essential to the formation of a
scholar.&nbsp; The whole structure exhibits an incongruous mode
of building, and that mixture of styles, &ldquo;where the Grecian
and the pointed, however discordant and irreconcilable, are
jumbled together, and compose a fantastic species, hardly
assignable to any class or name.&rdquo;&nbsp; The principal
school room, which occupies the upper story, was originally
divided by three partitions with folding doors, but these being
removed, it forms a very spacious and noble apartment.&nbsp; The
chapel, in which prayers are read by the head master every
morning, occupies the ground floor, and is divided from the
ante-chapel by a very handsome oak screen carved in the grotesque
manner prevalent in the days of Elizabeth.&nbsp; The ceiling is
adorned with fret work, preserved from the ruins of St.
Alkmund&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; Above the chapel is the library,
which was rebuilt at considerable expense in 1815.&nbsp; It
contains a valuable collection of manuscripts and books&mdash;one
side being occupied by the library of the late Dr. Taylor.&nbsp;
Two large pointed windows, with mullioned tracery, afford light
to this apartment;&mdash;in the northern window are the arms of
Edward VI., Queen Elizabeth, St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge;
the See of Lichfield and Coventry impaling Cornwallis, and those
of the town;&mdash;in the south windows are the arms of the four
principal benefactors, with appropriate inscriptions in
Latin.&nbsp; Around the walls are portraits of Henry VIII.,
Edward VI., an Admiral in the costume of the time of Charles II.,
and several of the former head masters.</p>
<p>Among the curiosities in the library are three sepulchral
stones, discovered in ploughing a field near Wroxeter.&nbsp; The
largest has on its summit, a pine-cone between two lions, and
beneath the pediment a rose.&nbsp; The first is taken from the
<i>Picea</i>, called by Pliny, <i>Feralis Arbor</i>, expressive
of its melancholy subject, and not unfrequent on memorials of
this kind; the inscription denotes the death of <i>C. Mannivus
Secundus</i>, of the town of Polentia, a <i>beneficiarius</i>, or
veteran of the twentieth legion, who had served his time, and was
called again into the service by the entreaties of the chief
legate.&nbsp; The second stone has, on the upper part, a human
face, two dolphins, and two serpents.&nbsp; The third is
inscribed to M. Petronius, sigifer, or standard bearer, to the
<i>Legio quatuor-decima gemina</i>, the fourteenth double legion,
or a legion formed from two.&nbsp; As this legion never was in
Britain, the learned Dr. Ward supposes that Petronius only came
for his health and died here.&nbsp; There are also various other
interesting antiquities, chiefly found at Wroxeter, and a small
collection of fossils and natural curiosities.&nbsp; In front and
at the back of the schools are play grounds, contiguous to which
are houses for the master and the assistant-masters, with ample
accommodation for boarders who come from all parts of the
kingdom.&nbsp; The grammar school has long maintained a
pre-eminent rank among the public seminaries of sound learning
and religious education in this country, and has sent forth
numerous individuals who have been <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>distinguished for their eminent
classical attainments.&nbsp; Under the care of its first master,
Thomas Ashton, we learn there were two hundred and ninety
scholars, among whom were the sons of many of the first families
in England.&nbsp; Camden, when he wrote, says&mdash;&ldquo;it was
the best filled in all England, being indebted for their
flourishinge state to provision made by the excellent and worthie
Thomas Ashton&rdquo;&mdash;who was a munificent contributor to
the school himself, and was instrumental in procuring the grant
of augmentation from Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; Mr. Ashton resigned
his office some years before his death, but he continued to
cherish the seminary over which he had presided with paternal
care.&nbsp; He drew up the code of laws by which it was governed
for more than two centuries; and one of his last acts was to
visit the school, when he preached a farewell sermon to the
inhabitants of the town, after which that &ldquo;Godlie
father,&rdquo; accompanied with the tears and blessings of the
people, returned to Cambridge, near which he died at the end of a
fortnight, 1578.</p>
<p>The school is open for the gratuitous instruction of burgesses
of Shrewsbury, who are not under six nor more than sixteen years
of age, provided they are qualified to begin the Latin
accidence.&nbsp; By act of parliament, 38th George III., the
whole management of the school and revenue was vested in the
Bishop of Lichfield, as visitor, and thirteen governors and
trustees.&nbsp; The appointment of head master rests with the
Fellows of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp; The under
master is appointed by the head master.&nbsp; Among the many
persons of eminence who have received their education in this
school, we may enumerate Sir Philip Sidney; Sir Fulke Greville;
Lord Brook; Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York; Judge Jeffries;
Lord Chief Justice Jones; Dr. Bowers; Bishop of Chichester; Dr.
Thomas Bishop, Salisbury; Dr. Taylor, editor of <i>Lysias and
Demosthenes</i>; James Harrington, the author of <i>Oceana</i>;
Wycherley, the dramatist; Ambrose Phillips, the poet; and the
Rev. J. B. Blakeway and the Venerable Archdeacon Owen, the
learned historians of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Through the exertions and
learning of the late venerable head master, Dr. Butler (late
Bishop of Lichfield), the school attained to unrivalled
celebrity, and the learned prelate observed, on resigning his
arduous duties to his talented successor, &ldquo;That he
considered Dr. Kennedy as the most brilliant scholar he had ever
sent forth, as the brightest star in that galaxy of distinguished
pupils whose names adorn the &lsquo;boards&rsquo; of Shrewsbury
school.&nbsp; That from Dr. Kennedy&rsquo;s experience of his
system, both as a pupil and assistant master at Shrewsbury
school, from his constant practice as a lecturer and private
tutor at College, and as an assistant master for six years or
more at Harrow, as well as from his own unrivalled talents and
high literary distinction, from his fine taste and sound
learning, there was not a shadow of doubt but that he would fully
maintain the reputation which Shrewsbury school had already
acquired, and would add at least as many distinguished names to
its &lsquo;boards,&rsquo; during his superintendence of this
important foundation, as had been inscribed there by himself in
an equal period.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are happy to observe that the
bright anticipations of the venerable bishop have been already
realised.&nbsp; By an act of parliament, passed 33rd George III.,
for the better government and regulation of the Free Grammar
School in Shrewsbury, it was ordered, that, after the payment of
all taxes, salaries, scholarships, exhibitions, and repairs of
the school, and all expenses about the necessary business of the
school, the surplus should be employed in founding and
maintaining exhibitions in the Universities of Cambridge and
Oxford, as the governors and the bishop of the diocese for the
time being should think fit; and that such surplus should, when
and as often as it should amount to &pound;100 or upwards, be
laid out in the purchase of lands and tenements, or in the
purchase of stock, or in such other way as the governors and
bishop should deem advisable.&nbsp; At this period the annual
income of the school amounted to &pound;900.</p>
<p>From the Charity Commissioners&rsquo; Report, published in
1830, we learn that the total income of the school property for
the year ending December 31st, 1828, amounted to &pound;2,740.
2s. 9d.&nbsp; The following will show the particulars of the
property held by the governors:&mdash;The tithes of Albrighton,
in the parish of St. Mary, &pound;101. 15s. 6d.; the <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>tithes of

pursuance of one of the orders of Thomas Ashton, for the scholars
to retire to in case of infectious disorders, let for &pound;4.
4s.; spiritual jurisdiction of St. Mary&rsquo;s, demised by the
corporation to the Rev. W. G. Rowland, the office of the said
ecclesiastical, spiritual, peculiar, and exempt jurisdiction,
with all the profits thereto belonging, and the seal of office
for twenty-one years, at the yearly rent of &pound;1. 6s. 8d.,
payable to the governors and trustees of the Free Grammar School,
dated 29th January, 1828; Chief rents at Astley and Sansaw, 18s.
3d.; for encroachments on school garden, 3s.; and &pound;30 per
annum arising from the sum of &pound;1,000 invested in the three
per cent. consols, purchased in 1828.&nbsp; In January, 1829, the
amount of stock was &pound;14,570. 10s. 4d. three per cent
consols.&nbsp; This was subsequently reduced by sales, made under
the directions of the Court of Chancery, for the purpose of
defraying the expenses of repairs on the estates, to
&pound;13,311. 19s. 6d.</p>
<p>The income arising from the school property now (1851) amounts
to upwards of &pound;3,000 per annum, which is appropriated in
the payment of the salaries of the masters, the maintenance of
scholarships and exhibitions in the universities, the stipend of
the Vicar of Chirbury, and the curates of St. Mary&rsquo;s,
Clive, and Astley, and the necessary repairs of the school
buildings.&nbsp; The surplus is employed in founding additional
exhibitions in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.&nbsp;
The following list will show the great advantage presented to
meritorious scholars of Shrewsbury School:&mdash;Four
exhibitions, of &pound;63 each, founded by James Millington,
D.D., in 1724, at Magdalen College, Cambridge, tenable during
residence till M.A.; two exhibitions of &pound;40 each, founded
by the same donor, for sons of burgesses born in Frankwell, and
who have been educated at the school, in Millington&rsquo;s
Hospital, founded by the testator; also one fellowship of
&pound;126 per annum at Magdalen College, tenable during
residence till M.A.; one exhibition, of &pound;23 per annum,
founded by the Rev. John Taylor, D.D., in 1766, open to any
college.&nbsp; The scholars chosen are allowed to enjoy the
exhibition for the term of six years, provided they reside in the
college the greater part of each term.&nbsp; One exhibition of
&pound;10 per annum, the gift of Mr. Noneley; one of &pound;30
per annum, founded by Mr. Podmore.&nbsp; There are also four
foundation exhibitions of &pound;70 per annum each; one Butler
foundation of &pound;100 per annum; and one of &pound;66 per
annum;&mdash;all limited to the sons of burgesses of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Two exhibitions, founded by Oswald Smith, of
&pound;25 per annum; four exhibitions to Christ Church, Oxford,
founded by Mr. Careswell, in 1689, for natives of Shropshire, of
&pound;60 per annum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bowdler&rsquo;s</span>, or <span
class="smcap">the Blue School</span>, situated in Beeches-lane, a
plain brick building with a cupola, was founded in 1724, pursuant
to the will of Mr. Thomas Bowdler, alderman and draper, for the
instruction, clothing, and apprenticeing poor children of St.
Julian&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; Twenty-five boys and an equal number
of girls are now educated and clothed; the dress of the children
is blue, whence the school is called &ldquo;The Blue
School.&rdquo;&nbsp; The master has a salary of &pound;40 per
annum, and the privilege of taking twenty day scholars, and the
mistress &pound;20 per annum.&nbsp; Robert Rogerson and Mary Ann
Sharrat are the teachers.&nbsp; The foundation of the several
charity schools will be more particularly noticed with the
general charities of the borough.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span><span
class="smcap">Allatt&rsquo;s Charity School</span>, situate in
St. John&rsquo;s-row, is a neat structure of free stone,
comprising commodious houses for the master and mistress,
connected by arcades, with spacious school rooms.&nbsp; The
school was built in 1800, pursuant to the will of Mr. John
Allatt, who bequeathed his property for the educating and
clothing of the children of the more respectable class of poor
persons resident in the town.&nbsp; There are forty boys and
forty girls educated, clothed once a year, and a certain number
at a proper age apprenticed.&nbsp; The funds of the school
consist of a capital stock of &pound;14,200, of which
&pound;10,800 are invested in three per cents, as the educational
fund, and &pound;3,400 as a clothing fund.&nbsp; Thomas Bagley
and Frances Buttery are the teachers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millington&rsquo;s School</span> stands in
the rear of the hospital, and was founded by the munificence of
Mr. Millington, for the instruction of twenty-five boys, and as
many girls, natives of Frankwell.&nbsp; The children are
completely clothed twice in every year, and at the age of
fourteen apprenticed with a small premium; on producing a
certificate of good conduct during their apprenticeship they are
rewarded with a gratuity.&nbsp; Two exhibitions of &pound;40 a
year each, in Magdalen College, Cambridge, are founded, to which
scholars originally on the hospital foundation have the
preference, or in default of such, two born in Frankwell,
educated at the free schools.&nbsp; Sarah Bishop and Francis
Cullis are the teachers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Shrewsbury National School</span>,
situated in the Abbey Fore gate, is also called the &ldquo;Brown
School,&rdquo; from the brown dress of the children.&nbsp; The
schools are commodious, and there is a convenient residence for
the teachers.&nbsp; It is supported by subscriptions, and sermons
annually preached in aid of its funds.&nbsp; There are now 190
boys and 96 girls educated in this school.&nbsp; Joseph Barker
Molynaux and Mary Ann Williamson are the teachers.&nbsp; The
annual income amounts to &pound;250 per annum.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Chad&rsquo;s Parochial School</span>
is a plain substantial edifice, situated in Barker-street.&nbsp;
It is supported by subscriptions and donations, and a small
weekly sum contributed by the children.&nbsp; The average number
of children that attend the school may be calculated at a hundred
boys and an equal number of girls.&nbsp; Edward Evans and Jane E.
Turner are teachers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Holy Trinity School</span> is a spacious
building of brick, situated in the rear of the Holy Trinity
Church, at Coleham; a residence for the teachers adjoins the
school.&nbsp; There are about 100 boys and girls, and 120
infants, receiving instructions in these schools.&nbsp; James
Owen and Martha Clarke are the teachers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Mary&rsquo;s and St. Michael&rsquo;s
Schools</span>, situated in St. Michael-street, owe their origin
in a great measure to the Rev. W. G. Rowland, the incumbent of
St. Mary&rsquo;s, who was a munificent contributor towards their
erection.&nbsp; The schools were built in 1832, in the old
English style of architecture.&nbsp; They are supported by
voluntary subscriptions, and the scholars are provided with
books, and gratuitously educated, with the exception of a number
of the children from the extensive factory of Messrs. Marshall
and Co., whose instruction is paid for by the proprietors of the
mill.&nbsp; Richard Jones and Sophia Evans are the
teachers.&nbsp; About 120 boys and 100 girls attend.&nbsp;
Adjoining the school premises are ten neat cottages, built by the
Rev. W. G. Rowland, the income arising from which is expended in
bread, and distributed amongst the necessitous poor, in St.
Mary&rsquo;s and St. Michael&rsquo;s churches.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Diocesan Schools</span>, Swan hill, in
connection with the Lichfield Board of Education, was established
in 1842.&nbsp; This is an institution for the general education
of youth, ably conducted by Mr. Henry Newsham.&nbsp; Particular
attention is paid to the mathematical education of the youth of
this establishment.&nbsp; A limited number of boarders are
taken.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The British</span> or <span
class="smcap">Lancasterian Schools</span> were first established
in Shrewsbury in 1812, when a commodious school was built
opposite the county gaol, for conducting education on the plan
suggested by Mr. Joseph Lancaster.&nbsp; Subsequently the
premises were <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>taken down, and the site is now occupied as a railway
station.&nbsp; A building was afterwards taken in Watery-lane,
where the school was conducted till the present year (1851), when
a neat school-house, measuring forty-eight feet by twenty-eight,
was erected at the rear of the county gaol, at an estimated cost
of &pound;700.&nbsp; About 150 boys and 100 girls attend the
school.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Harris is the teacher.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Alkmund&rsquo;s Parochial
School</span>, situated between St. Mary&rsquo;s-street and St.
Alkmund&rsquo;s-place, is numerously attended both by boys and
girls.&nbsp; The teachers are William Donellan and Martha
Badger.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Infant Schools</span>.&mdash;<i>St.
Chad&rsquo;s Infant School</i> is situated in Barker-street, not
far from the National School.&nbsp; One hundred and twenty attend
the school, which is conducted by Segismunda Roberts.&nbsp; The
<i>Infant School</i>, Castle Foregate, has an attendance of
eighty.&nbsp; Ann Townsend is the teacher.&nbsp; There is also an
infant school in Frankwell, which was built by the late Dr.
Darwin, and is now chiefly supported by Miss Darwin.&nbsp; These
are interesting institutions for giving an early moral bias to
the mind, and calculated to effect much good.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sunday Schools</span>.&mdash;The Sunday
schools of Shrewsbury have existed nearly from the earliest
formation of such institutions.&nbsp; Schools are connected with
the established churches, and the different congregations of
dissenters, which are very numerously attended.</p>
<h3>PUBLIC BUILDINGS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The Salop Infirmary</span>.&mdash;This
excellent institution, situated near St. Mary&rsquo;s churchyard,
was established in 1747, and has the honour of being one of the
earliest of these Samaritan institutions in the kingdom.&nbsp;
The building, which preceded the present stately fabric, was a
plain brick structure, designed for a private residence; although
repeatedly enlarged, it was found too small for the additional
number of patients consequent upon an increasing population, and
at a meeting held on November 16th, 1826, it was resolved that a
new infirmary should be built on the site of the old one.&nbsp;
The present building was erected in 1830, from a design by Mr.
Haycock, at the cost of &pound;18,735. 18s. 10., of which
&pound;12,994. 1s. 3d. was raised by subscriptions, and the
remainder disbursed from the funded property of the
charity.&nbsp; The structure has a noble appearance, and stands
in a commanding position on the verge of an eminence overlooking
the Severn; it is 170 feet in length, by 80 feet in height,
having a handsome Doric portico in the centre.&nbsp; There is
ample accommodation for 150 patients, and the internal
arrangements are admirably adapted for the purpose they are
designed to fulfil.&nbsp; The principal floor is appropriated to
the board room, dispensary, waiting room for patients, with
private apartments for the house surgeon and matron; the first
floor has seven wards for male patients, with day room, scullery,
and baths; the upper room contains a spacious operation room,
with wards for females; in the attics above are four other wards
with nurses&rsquo; room, &amp;c.&nbsp; A staircase at each end
communicates with spacious galleries extending the length of each
story.&nbsp; The whole is thoroughly ventilated, and an uniform
temperature preserved by a patent hot water apparatus.&nbsp; A
spacious terrace has been constructed on the eastern side, that
such of the patients as are able may possess every benefit
resulting from pure air and exercise.&nbsp; From this the eye
commands an uninterrupted view of an extensive and finely wooded
country, bounded by the long ridge of Haughmond Hill, the Wrekin,
and the Stretton Hills.&nbsp; The pecuniary concerns of the
institution are superintended by a board of directors; a
treasurer is also appointed annually, who, on the anniversary day
in the hunt week, is accompanied to church by the subscribers and
patrons of this charity, where, after a sermon, a collection is
made in aid of the funds.&nbsp; From its establishment to
midsummer, 1849, the sum of &pound;219,934. 16s. 7&frac14;d. has
been received for its support; 60,077 in-patients admitted, and
117,747 out-patients recommended as fit objects for its
benefits.&nbsp; The weekly average number of patients in the
house during the year ending midsummer, 1849, was 103;
out-patients on the books, <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>603.&nbsp; The total receipts for the
year ending at the same period was &pound;3,237. 7s. 5d., of
which &pound;1,669. 11s. was received from yearly subscriptions;
&pound;355. 2s. 6d. from benefactions and legacies; &pound;627.
6s. 11d., the interest and dividends of funded stock, and
&pound;585. 7s. 6d. from miscellaneous sources, which includes
&pound;183 8s. 6d. collected at the anniversary sermon in St.
Chad&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; Of this stock &pound;16,400 is secured
in the three per cent consols, &pound;3,449. 10s. new 3&frac14;
per cents; &pound;100 on the Watling-street road, and &pound;150
on the Bridgnorth-road.&nbsp; Subscriptions have been made
amounting to &pound;1,227. 6s. 8d., as a &ldquo;Chaplain&rsquo;s
Endowment Fund.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The house surgeon is allowed
to take three pupils at a premium of twenty guineas to himself,
and 200 guineas to the infirmary, which entitles the pupil to
board and residence for five years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Attendance at
this hospital is recognized by the Royal College of Surgeons, and
the apothecaries&rsquo; company, London.&mdash;<i>Physicians</i>:
Henry Johnson, M.D., Thomas James Drury, M.D., Henry Parker,
M.D.&mdash;<i>Surgeons</i>: H. E. Burd, J. Dickin, and J. Y.
Arrowsmith.&mdash;<i>House Surgeon</i>: John Robert
Humphreys.&nbsp; <i>Secretary</i>: Henry Bevan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Dispensary</span>, like most other
institutions of this kind, is supported by annual subscriptions
and benefactions.&nbsp; It was established in 1843, and although
the funds do not allow the full extent of usefulness which the
charity is capable of, yet it is pleasing to observe from the
annual reports that it is making steady progress in the
estimation of the public.&nbsp; It appears from the report ending
September, 1849, that the total number of patients have been
3,391.&nbsp; The receipts for the year ending at the same period
were &pound;160.&nbsp; During the year 560 cases received
attention, of which 403 were cured, 123 relieved, 30 died, and 4
were dismissed.&mdash;<i>Patron</i>: His Grace the Duke of
Sutherland.&mdash;<i>Surgeon</i>: Mr. G. P. Gill,&mdash;<i>Hon.
Secretary</i>: Folliott Sandford, Esq.&mdash;<i>Dispenser</i>:
Mr. G. S. Whitney.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Eye and Ear Establishment</span>,
Castle-street, was established in 1818, under the management of a
committee of gentlemen, for the special object of affording
relief to the humbler members of society, who may be suffering
from any calamity incident to those delicate organs of the human
frame, the eye and ear.&nbsp; The number of patients admitted
from the opening of this institution has been
6,224.&mdash;<i>President</i>: Viscount
Hill.&mdash;<i>Surgeon</i>: Edwin Foulkes.&nbsp; The institution
is open every Wednesday and Saturday mornings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The County Hall</span>, situated in the
Market-square, is a handsome and commodious building, completed
in 1837, at the cost of about &pound;13,000.&nbsp; It is built
from a design of Sir Robert Smirke, of beautiful white free
stone, the principal front measuring 112 feet in length, and
exhibits the Italian style of architecture.&nbsp; In the interior
of the structure the different apartments are convenient, lofty,
and well adapted to the various purposes for which they are
intended.&nbsp; On the ground floor is a commodious vestibule,
which communicates with rooms on each side, for the mayor, and
counsel at assizes and witnesses.&nbsp; Opposite the entrance
door is a noble staircase; on the first landing, the centre one
leading to the judge&rsquo;s room, and those on each side to the
respective courts, which are of equal dimensions, forty-two feet
by thirty-six feet.&nbsp; The bench is elevated three feet above
the floor, on each side is accommodation for the magistrates;
immediately before the judge is a large table, with seats
provided for the councillors.&nbsp; In each court is a gallery
for the public, and the ceiling is panelled and ornamented.&nbsp;
From this division the staircase leads to another large room,
adapted for a third court, or other public purpose; above it are
offices for the clerk of the peace, and for the town clerk.</p>
<p>The ancient Guild or Shire Hall was a low timbered fabric,
with a high clock turret, erected in the reign of Henry VIII.,
and stood across the market square.&nbsp; The lower part was
appropriated to retail shops, and the upper story contained the
rooms in which the business of the town was transacted, and the
assizes held.&nbsp; The municipal records were preserved in a
strong square tower near the south east side, erected in
1490.&nbsp; At the summer assizes, in 1783, in consequence of the
pressing remonstrance of the judge, enforced by the threat of a
fine upon the county, an act of parliament was obtained <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the following
year for this purpose.&nbsp; To render the new building more
handsome and commodious, and to remove the inconvenience
occasioned by the old one standing across the street of the
greatest resort, several houses, together with the ancient tower
of the Exchequer, were taken down, and various other improvements
made, in the adjacent parts.&nbsp; The new hall was completed in
1785, at an expense of &pound;11,000, raised by a county
rate.&nbsp; In consequence of sinkings having in 1832 been
observed in different parts of the structure, the building was
surveyed by different architects and pronounced unsafe and
dangerous.&nbsp; The proper authorities immediately determined to
take down the whole edifice, and erect a more commodious one on
its site.&nbsp; For this purpose some adjoining premises were
purchased, and the present substantial structure, admirably
adapted for the purposes intended, was completed, as already
noticed, by Messrs. Birch, builders, in 1837.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Town and County Gaol</span> stands on
a salubrious cliff of gravel, a short distance from the castle,
and contiguous to the railway station.&nbsp; The building was
erected in 1793, on the principles of the benevolent Howard, at
an expense of &pound;30,000.&nbsp; The front of the prison
displays a bold and massive appearance, having two rusticated
stone lodges and a gateway in the centre, over which is a fine
bust of Howard, by Bacon.&nbsp; The building is of brick, and is
spacious, airy, and well supplied with water, by means of a pump
worked by the prisoners.&nbsp; Immediately in front of the
gateway is the governor&rsquo;s house, which, with certain
offices, forms the southern front of the building.&nbsp; The
chapel is an octagonal structure in the centre of the prison, and
is contrived so as to separate every class of prisoners, yet, so
that the minister may be seen by all the congregation.&nbsp; The
remainder of the structure is divided into four principal courts,
with several smaller ones, around which are cloisters, with
sleeping rooms above for the prisoners, and cells for the
refractory.&nbsp; A regard to the gradation of vice is strictly
observed in the classification of the prisoners, many of whom are
employed in some useful trade, such as shoemakers, tailors,
blacksmiths, &amp;c., others are employed in picking oakum and
wool.&nbsp; The galling and disgraceful restraints of irons are
altogether dispensed with, except in cases of capital and very
refractory offenders.&nbsp; Great attention is paid to the moral
culture of the inmates by the assiduous chaplain, in order to
reclaim the wanderer.&nbsp; Divine service is performed twice
every day, except Saturday; and the prisoners are all separately
catechised several times during the week.&nbsp; The water to
supply the gaol is pumped from the Severn into a large reservoir,
which will hold 2,000 gallons.&nbsp; The gaol is calculated to
accommodate 300 prisoners, and there are 135 separate
cells.&nbsp; During the year ending September, 1849, there was a
total of 1,291 prisoners; greatest number of prisoners at any one
time in the year, 203; daily average of criminals, 147; daily
average of debtors, 9.&nbsp; Gross expenditure for the same
period, &pound;3,337. 17s. 8d.&nbsp; Mr. John Shepherd is the
governor; and the Rev. David Winstone, chaplain.&nbsp; The
corporate magistrates are entitled, under the act for erecting
this gaol, to send to it prisoners, both criminal and civil, for
whose maintenance, of course, the borough pays.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Market House</span>, situated in the
Market Square, an antique and interesting fabric, is one of the
handsomest structures of its kind in the kingdom.&nbsp; In Dr.
Taylor&rsquo;s MSS. is the following account of the first Market
House in this town of which any record remains:&mdash;&ldquo;This
yere, 1567, Maister John Dawes, of Shrosbery, an alderman of the
sayde towne, began and buylded two fayre houses in the Corne
Market there, for the saffe placinge of corne from wether, so
that the owners thereof may stand saffe and drye, the which
buildings was at his own coste and charge, which place servyth
for the inhabitantes as also strangers to walke in, and the loft
above for soondry profitable purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp; To these
timber buildings others were added in 1571, for the like
purpose.&nbsp; In 1595 the whole was removed, and the present
structure built on the site.&nbsp; The principal front is towards
the west, and has in the centre a spacious portal, over which are
sculptured the <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>arms of Elizabeth.&nbsp; On each side of the portal is
an open arcade of three round arches, supported by massive
pillars, over which a range of square mullioned windows lights
the upper story.&nbsp; Large open arches occupy the north and
south ends, which are terminated with pointed gables.&nbsp; Above
the northern arch is a tabernacled niche, containing a statue of
Richard, Duke of York, in complete armour, with his armorial
bearings, removed from the tower of the old Welsh Bridge, on its
demolition in 1791.&nbsp; At the south end is the figure of an
angel, in a canopied niche, bearing a shield of the arms of
France and England.&nbsp; This fragment of antiquity formerly
stood in the southern tower of the Castle, or North Gate, and was
removed here in 1825, when that building was taken down to widen
the street.&nbsp; The basement of the Market House is 105 feet
long, and 24 feet wide.&nbsp; The upper story is devoted to the
purposes of a Mechanics&rsquo; Institution.&nbsp; The market is
held on Saturday, is numerously attended by farmers from the
surrounding district, and considerable quantities of corn are
sold, chiefly by sample.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Music Hall and Public Rooms</span>
occupy the southern side of the Market Square, and form a
handsome pile of building, erected in 1840 from a design by Mr.
Haycock.&nbsp; On the ground floor is the Post Office; and
immediately above, the Public News Room, which is supported by
annual subscription.&nbsp; The Music Hall, a noble apartment,
occupies the remaining portion of the second floor.&nbsp; It
measures 90 feet in length, 42 feet wide, and 38 feet high.&nbsp;
The orchestra, which is situated at the south end, contains a
fine-toned and powerful organ, the munificent gift of the late
Rev. Richard Scott, B.D., to the Choral Society of the
town.&nbsp; On the third story are Billiard Rooms, &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Theatre</span>, situated in the
Shoplatch, has a lofty stuccoed front, with three niches,
containing statues of the immortal Shakspere, and of the comic
and tragic muses, which give it a bold and imposing effect.&nbsp;
The lower part consists of a rusticated base, one hundred feet in
length, comprising a range of good shops, and a dwelling for the
manager.&nbsp; The interior is conveniently arranged, and
handsomely decorated with appropriate devices.&nbsp; It will
accommodate a numerous audience; and was opened September 8th,
1834.&nbsp; It stands on the site of a former Theatre, which, if
we may credit the affirmation of Phillips, was part of the
ancient palace of the Princes of Powisland, who, in their
frequent transactions with the sovereigns of England, often
resided in Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The ancient boundary wall of this
mansion inclosed all the space contained between Cross Hill, St.
John&rsquo;s Hill, Murivance, Swan Hill, and Shoplatch.&nbsp; It
is probable that the old edifice was part of the great chamber,
appropriated, according to the usage of the times, for receiving
company, and occasionally for exhibiting shows and dramatic
interludes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Shropshire and North Wales Natural
History and Antiquarian Society</span> was established on the
26th of June, 1835.&nbsp; The Museum, situated in Dogpole, is
principally designed to illustrate the natural history of the
district in its various branches of geology, mineralogy, zoology,
and botany, by the gradual formation of complete and systematic
arrangements of its productions in each of these
departments.&nbsp; It is also open to other objects of scientific
interest, and in particular is a suitable repository for such
remains of antiquity as are found within the district, or
illustrate its general history.&nbsp; The library contains many
valuable books, illustrative of natural history and
antiquities.&nbsp; It is deeply to be regretted, that hitherto
the council have been able to do little more than maintain the
museum in existence.&nbsp; Had they been entrusted with a larger
amount of funds, they might have very considerably enlarged its
collection, and extended its interests.&nbsp; Many donations are
still in store for exhibition, whenever a more commodious
building can be procured.&nbsp; It is, therefore, hoped that a
district of so much scientific and antiquarian resource may,
before long, be furnished with a building, in which specimens of
its own productions may be placed for inspection, and which may
also be a repository for objects of general interest and national
importance.&nbsp; <i>President</i>: The Right Hon. the Earl of

class="smcap">The Mechanics&rsquo; Institution</span> was
originally established in 1825, and in the year 1833 a building
was erected for their meetings, in Howard Street.&nbsp; The
committee of management subsequently took the Corn Market
chambers, which are found admirably adapted for the objects of
the institution, which affords to mechanics, artisans, and
others, opportunities of acquiring, at their leisure hours, the
principles of science and the arts; and for the cultivation of
literature.&nbsp; The library comprises upwards of 2,000 volumes,
and the reading-room is supplied with the leading London and
provincial newspapers and magazines.&nbsp; There are classes for
the English and French languages, arithmetic, mathematics,
writing, drawing, music, and modelling.&nbsp; The present number

<p><span class="smcap">The Church of England Literary and
Scientific Institution</span> was established in 1850, under the
patronage of the Lord Bishop of Lichfield.&nbsp; Its general
object is to afford the young men of the town of Shrewsbury the
means of spending their leisure hours in a rational and
profitable manner, and of acquiring useful knowledge on literary
and scientific subjects, in subservience to the doctrines and
precepts of revealed religion.&nbsp; A library and reading room
have been established, and competent persons employed to deliver
lectures on various interesting and scientific subjects.&nbsp;
All persons subscribing twelve shillings and sixpence annually,
or five guineas in one donation, to the funds of the institution,
are members; and all persons elected by the committee, on the
payment of six shillings per annum, have the advantages of the
institution.&nbsp; <i>Treasurer</i>, W. B. Lloyd, Esq.&nbsp;

<p><span class="smcap">The Circus</span>, a spacious building
situated near the Welsh bridge, was formerly used for equestrian
performances.&nbsp; It is now used as a depot for the immense
quantities of butter and cheese which are brought to the town for
sale at the monthly fairs; considerable quantities of these
commodities are brought from Wales.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Butter and Poultry Market</span>,
situated at the top of Pride-hill, was erected in 1819 by
voluntary contributions amounting to &pound;2000.&nbsp; It is not
at all commensurate with the wants of the town, and of the ample
produce brought to its weekly markets large quantities are
exposed for sale in the streets.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The New Butter and Cheese Market</span>,
situated in Howard-street, is a spacious building containing an
area of 5400 feet.&nbsp; The exterior consists of a centre and
two wings, and has a handsome appearance; the roof is supported
by four rows of cast iron pillars&mdash;and there is ample room
to dispose of the large quantities of butter and cheese which are
brought for sale on the Wednesdays following the first fair in
each month.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The House of Industry</span> was
originally built as an asylum for the reception of orphans from
the Foundling Hospital in London.&nbsp; This spacious structure
is situated at Kingsland, and crowns the steep eminence above the
river, whence a most delightful and picturesque view of the town
and country is obtained.&nbsp; The governor of the Foundling
Hospital began the building in 1760, and finished it in five
years, at an expense of &pound;12,000.&nbsp; Children were sent
down from London in great numbers, and put out to nurse <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>with the
neighbouring cottagers, under the inspection of the gentlemen in
the vicinity.&nbsp; At a proper age they were taken into the
house, where they were employed in the manufacture of wool, and
afterwards placed out as apprentices.&nbsp; At one time there
were more than four hundred orphans in the hospital; but the
funds of the institution not proving adequate to the plan of
sending children to provincial hospitals, it was discontinued in
1774.&nbsp; After being shut up several years, it was converted
into a place of confinement for the Dutch prisoners taken in the
American war.&nbsp; It was afterwards used as an infirmary,
whilst the present noble structure was building.&nbsp; The rapid
increase of the parochial rates, of Shrewsbury, induced the
inhabitants to petition parliament for an act to incorporate the
five parishes of the Town and Meole Brace, so far as concerned
the poor, and to establish a general House of Industry.&nbsp; In
1784, they purchased the orphan hospital from the governors of
the foundling charity, for the admission of the poor, who, in
their declining years, here find an appropriate shelter, and are
supplied with decent and comfortable necessaries of life.&nbsp;
The situation is highly salubrious, and the terrace in front of
the house commands a fine view of the quarry, the town, its
suburbs, and the whole range of mountains in Salop, Montgomery,
and Denbigh.&nbsp; The internal arrangements have a clean and
orderly appearance, and the kind attention of the governor and
guardians to the wants of the inmates, who are chiefly the aged,
infirm, and helpless poor children, is highly creditable.&nbsp;
[When we visited the house there were six old women of the age of
75 and upwards, one had reached the age of 95 years.]&nbsp; There
is accommodation for 350 inmates, exclusive of that portion of
the building which has been let off as a private asylum; the
inmates are now 75.&nbsp; The infirmary and vagrant ward are in
the rear, as are the schools, which are held in a building
formerly used for hand-loom weaving; adjoining which are four
acres of land, cultivated by the scholars; it is chiefly used in
raising green crops, and is highly productive.&nbsp; The union
embraces the parishes of St. Chad, St. Mary, St. Alkmund, St.
Julian, Holy Cross, and Meole Brace, for which ten guardians are
appointed.&nbsp; <i>Chairman</i>, Mr. Charles Lloyd.&nbsp;
<i>Surgeon</i>, Henry Keate.&nbsp; <i>Chaplain</i>, Rev. W. J.
James.&nbsp; <i>Governor</i>, Mr. William N. Kindellon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Savings&rsquo; Bank</span>, situated
on College-hill, was erected in 1838, at a cost of &pound;2000,
which includes a sum of &pound;600 given for the site.&nbsp; The
capital stock of the bank, on November 20th, 1849, amounted to
&pound;179,990. 6s., at which time 4461 depositors, 56 Charitable
societies, and 42 Friendly societies had accounts with the
bank.&nbsp; Of the depositors there were 2329 whose respective
balances did not exceed &pound;20; 1138 were above &pound;20 and
not exceeding &pound;50; 587 were above &pound;50 and not
exceeding &pound;100; 253, not exceeding &pound;150; 134 not
exceeding &pound;200; and 20 exceeding the latter amount.&nbsp;
The bank is open on Monday and Saturday, from 11.30, a.m. to
1.30, p.m.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Blount, <i>Actuary</i>.&nbsp; The
gross amount of the capital invested by the Charitable Societies,
amounts to &pound;307. 14s. 5d.; and of the Friendly Societies,
to &pound;18,362. 5s. 4d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Royal Baths</span>, situated at
Benbow-place, were established in 1831, by Mr. William
Onions.&nbsp; The front of the building exhibits a chaste design,
being ornamented by a portico, supported by two Ionic pillars,
and two pilasters.&nbsp; The conveniences, are varied and ample,
and such as are only to be met with in the first rate
establishments in the kingdom.&nbsp; The moderate charges and
strict attention to cleanliness and comfort will, no doubt,
insure to them an extensive patronage.&nbsp; The swimming bath is
of sufficient dimensions to enable persons to learn or practice
the art of swimming; there are also hot, air, vapour, shower,
warm, medicated, salt, and fresh water baths in constant
readiness.&nbsp; A charge of 21s. per annum is made for the use
of the swimming bath, and sixpence for a single bath.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Shrewsbury Waterworks</span> were
established, by a company of shareholders, under an act of
parliament, obtained in 1830, for the purpose of affording the
inhabitants a constant supply of water from the Severn.&nbsp; The
works are situated in Chester-street, and the water is raised by
means of a steam engine, capable of throwing up 20,000 gallons
per <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>hour,
into a large reservoir near the top of Pride-hill, and thence
distributed in pipes to all parts of the town.&nbsp; The town is
also gratuitously supplied with excellent water from a fine
spring called Broadwell, near Crow Meole, distant about two
miles, being conducted thence to conduits placed in different
parts of the town for the convenience of the inhabitants.&nbsp;
Few towns have such an excellent and abundant supply of this fine
beverage of nature.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Gas Works</span> are situated in the
Castle Foregate, near the goods dep&ocirc;t of the Shrewsbury and
Ellesmere canal.&nbsp; They were established in 1820 by a company
of shareholders with a capital stock of &pound;10,000 raised in
&pound;10 shares.&nbsp; The luminous vapour is supplied from
three gasometers which will hold together 80,000 cubic feet of
gas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Railway Station</span>.&mdash;The
united station of the Shrewsbury and Chester, the Shrewsbury and
Birmingham, and the Shrewsbury and Stafford branch of the
Shropshire Union Railway, is a magnificent structure in the
perpendicular style of architecture, situated near the
Castle-gates.&nbsp; It exhibits a frontage of 150 feet in length,
and two stories in height, with a square tower in the centre,
ornamented with a richly carved battlement, with octagonal
turrets of considerable elevation, at the corners.&nbsp; On each
side of the tower extends a large wing, divided into four equal
spaces by projecting turrets.&nbsp; The ridge of the roof is
finished with an ornamental cast iron crest, and the windows are
divided by stone transoms and mullions.&nbsp; The total cost of
the station-house, offices, and engineering works, was
&pound;51,000; the goods, engine-station, and other necessary
works &pound;20,000.&nbsp; The gross cost of the above works,
including the viaduct of the Severn, contiguous to the station,
and the bridge over Castle Foregate, exceeded &pound;100,000.</p>
<p>The ground floor is appropriated to booking offices, waiting
rooms, and a large refreshment room; above are the offices for
the clerks, and other offices.&nbsp; The platforms respectively
measure 600 feet, and 450 in length, and 16 feet wide.&nbsp; A
wrought iron roof, beautifully designed, of 70 feet span, covers
the platforms and lines of rails for a space of 450 feet.&nbsp;
The goods and coal depots are situated between the station and
Coton-hill, with convenient access from Castle Foregate-street:
here an abundance of coal, lime, and slates is always on
hand.&nbsp; Near the station is the <i>Viaduct</i> over the
Severn, consisting of seven elliptical arches, 45 feet
span.&nbsp; The rails are 36 feet above the ordinary level of the
river.&nbsp; A cast iron bridge of sixty-four feet span, from the
Brymbo iron works, carries the Shrewsbury and Chester railway
over the Castle Foregate.&nbsp; The whole of the works were
executed by Mr. Brassey, the contractor, under the direction of
Mr. James Baylis, the resident engineer, at the joint expense of
the several companies whose lines unite in Shrewsbury.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Hill&rsquo;s Column</span>, erected
to commemorate the brilliant victories and achievements of that
distinguished warrior, stands on rising ground near the entrance
of Abbey Foregate, from the London road, and forms a conspicuous
and interesting object to the surrounding country.&nbsp; This
fine Doric pillar, considered to be the largest in the world, was
completed on the 18th of June, 1816, at a cost of &pound;5,973.
13s. 2d.&nbsp; The pedestal, which is square, has a buttress at
each angle, on which is a lion couchant, worked out of Grinshill
free stone, of which material is the column.&nbsp; The chastely
fluted shaft is surmounted by a cylindrical pedestal, supporting
a statue of his lordship, of colossal proportions, executed in
artificial stone, by Messrs. Coade and Sealey, London.&nbsp; The
statue is 17 feet high, and the height of the pillar 116 feet,
making a total height of 133 feet from the ground to the top of
the statue.&nbsp; A beautiful spiral staircase, the munificent
donation of the builder, Mr. Straphen, winds round the interior
of the shaft, and opens on the summit, at the base of the
pedestal of the statue, whence the visitor will enjoy a beautiful
panoramic view of Shrewsbury and the fertile plains of
Shropshire, unrivalled in extent and splendour.&nbsp; On the
sides of the pedestal are inscriptions, recording the victories
of the gallant general, to whose honour this voluntary tribute of
Salopian esteem was erected.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Armoury</span>, situated near to St.
Giles&rsquo; church, is a spacious brick edifice, built by
government in 1806, at an expense of &pound;10,000, and intended
as a dep&ocirc;t for containing <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the arms of the volunteer corps of
this and the adjoining counties.&nbsp; The principal building is
135 feet long by 39 feet wide, divided into an upper and lower
story, capable of containing 25,000 stand of arms; at each angle
is a small residence, and within the enclosure are two magazines
for ammunition.&nbsp; The arms having been removed to Chester,
the premises have remained unoccupied ever since.&nbsp; The
structure now presents a dilapidated appearance; it has become by
purchase the property of Lord Berwick.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The County Court Offices</span> for the
recovery of debts not exceeding &pound;20 are situate in Wyle
Cop.&nbsp; The court contains within its jurisdiction the
following parishes and places, viz.:&mdash;Acton Burnell,

<p><span class="smcap">The Cattle Market</span> or <span
class="smcap">New Smithfield</span>, situated near the banks of
the Severn, on a plot of land called Raven Meadow, is approached
from the lower part of Mardol, and the Castle gates nearly
opposite the railway station.&nbsp; This market covers four acres
of land, and is not surpassed by any provincial market in England
for the conveniences it affords, and its adaptation to the
purposes intended.&nbsp; It was opened on November 19th,
1850.&nbsp; The total cost has been &pound;15,000, of which
&pound;2500 was expended in raising the ground.&nbsp; A lofty
brick wall surrounds the market, which is capable of affording
accommodation for 700 horses, 1400 cattle, 5000 sheep, and 1000
pigs, with suitable trial ground for the horses, appropriate pens
for the sheep and pigs, and a long range of sheds under the north
wall for the cattle.&nbsp; If the tolls are not sufficient to pay
the interest of the money borrowed for the formation of the
market, the act of parliament authorizes a rate upon the town to
meet the deficiency.&nbsp; The market or fair is held every
alternate Tuesday, when stock of all kinds is brought in very
considerable quantities for sale.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fairs</span> for cattle, horses, sheep,
pigs, and fat stock are held every alternate Tuesday.&nbsp; The
following will be the dates for the year 1851,
viz.:&mdash;January 14, 28; February 11, 25; March 11, 25; April
8, 22; May 6, 20; June 3, 17; July 1, 15, 29; August 12, 26;

<p><span class="smcap">Butter and Cheese Fair</span> is held on
the Wednesday following the first fair in each month.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wool Fair</span> takes place on July 1
and August 26.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The English Bridge</span> is a substantial
and elegant structure, 400 feet in length, and composed of seven
arches, crowned by a bold balustrade.&nbsp; It was erected in
1774, at an expense of &pound;15,710, of which &pound;11,494 was
raised by voluntary subscriptions.&nbsp; The central arch is
sixty feet in width, and forty in height, which is double the
height of the end arches, and consequently disagreeably steep;
the breadth of the thoroughfare is also inconveniently narrow
(only twenty-five feet) for the innumerable carriages and
passengers which are continually passing over it.&nbsp; The
object in its construction was to contrive as much space as
possible for the water during floods.&nbsp; With the exception of
this defect, its architectural beauty is surpassed by few bridges
in the kingdom; it is highly ornamental to the town, and an
equally noble monument of the public spirit of the gentry of the
county.&nbsp; The keystone of the central arch is adorned with a
fine head of Sabrina, <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>&ldquo;goddess of the river,&rdquo;
and that on the opposite side with a head of Neptune, the
&ldquo;father of fountains.&rdquo;&nbsp; The keystones of the
other arches are worked into a shell; on the central piers of the
arches are finely carved dolphins.</p>
<p>The old English bridge, built probably by the abbots and
burgesses conjointly, was taken down on the completion of the
present structure.&nbsp; It was constructed on seventeen arches,
and extended over the main stream, also an arm of the river now
filled up which flowed into the Meole Brook; its length was 864
feet, and the breadth only 12 feet, being greatly encumbered with
houses.&nbsp; Near the eastern extremity was a gate and a strong
embattled tower, with chamber and portcullis, and beyond a
draw-bridge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Welsh Bridge</span>, so called on
account of the road from Shrewsbury to a considerable part of
North Wales lying over it, is situated at the foot of Mardol, and
crosses the river into the populous suburb of Frankwell.&nbsp; It
is a bold and substantial structure, consisting of five arches,
the length being 266 feet and the breadth 30 feet, completed in
1795, at an expense of &pound;8000, raised by
subscriptions.&nbsp; The old Welsh bridge taken down on the
erection of the above structure, was situated a few yards higher
up the stream than the present fabric.&nbsp; It was a most
interesting monument of antiquity, and consisted of seven arches,
with massive gate towers at each extremity, in the finest style
of castellated building.&nbsp; Leland, who visited Shrewsbury in
1539, in describing this bridge says:&mdash;&ldquo;It is the
greatest, faynest, and highest upon the stream, having six great
arches of stone; it standeth on the west syde of the towne, and
hath at the one end of it a great gate to enter by into the
towne; and at the other end towardes Wales a mighty stronge towre
to prohibit enemies to enter on the bridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Above
one of the gates stood an armed statue of a knight, which was
removed in 1791, and placed in a niche in front of the
Market-house.&nbsp; This effigy was an important object of
attraction to the Welshmen, from a tradition, that it represented
Llewelyn, Prince of Wales.&nbsp; Antiquaries, from its attendant
embellishments, state it represented Richard Duke of York.&nbsp;
The tolls arising from marketable goods over this bridge were
abolished by the payment of &pound;6000 to the corporation, which
sum was raised by public subscriptions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Railway Viaduct</span> over the
Severn, situated a little east from the station, consists of
seven elliptical arches, forty-five span, and thirty-six feet
above the ordinary level of the river.&nbsp; The whole has a
bold, massive, and elegant appearance.&mdash;A <span
class="GutSmall">BRIDGE</span> of cast iron of sixty-four feet
span, crosses the Castle Foregate, and carries the four lines of
rails of the Chester and Shrewsbury railway.&mdash;A <span
class="GutSmall">WOODEN BRIDGE</span>, consisting of two timber
arches, eighty-five feet span each, on the bow and spring
principle, leads from the public walk called the Dana, over the
railway station, to the front of the county gaol.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Trade and Manufactures</span>.&mdash;The
trade of this town was once esteemed of great importance to the
kingdom, and though its consequence has been eclipsed by the
subsequent increase of other places, yet it has never been
destitute of a considerable share of internal commerce.&nbsp; In
early times it was distinguished for its glove cloth, and shoe
manufactories, but its ancient traffic in Welsh woollens was in a
great measure the cause of the former opulence of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Camden, in his account of the town in 1586,
observes:&mdash;&ldquo;It is a fine city, and of good commerce;
and by the industry of the citizens and their cloth manufacture,
and their trade with the Welsh, is very rich, for hither the
Welsh commodities are brought as to the common mart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pennant, who wrote more than half a century ago,
says:&mdash;&ldquo;From very early days this place possessed
almost exclusively the trade with Wales, in a coarse kind of
woollen cloth called Welsh webs, which were brought from Merinoth
and Montgomeryshire to a market held here weekly on
Thursday.&nbsp; They were afterwards dressed, that is, the wool
raised on one side, by a set of people called shearmen.&nbsp; At
the time of Queen Elizabeth the trade was so great, that not
fewer than 600 persons maintained themselves by this
occupation.&nbsp; The cloth was sent chiefly to America to clothe
the negroes, or to Flanders, where it is used by the
peasants.&nbsp; At present the greatest part of this traffic is
diverted into other channels, and <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>not more than four or five hundred
thousand yards are brought to the ancient mart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
stout Welshmen were accustomed to come to the market, with troops
of hardy ponies, each with a halter of twisted straw, and laden
with bales of cloth.</p>
<p>It was a practice of the drapers and shearmen to assemble at
the Market-house at two o&rsquo;clock, and according to ancient
usage proceed up stairs in seniority.&nbsp; The traffic was a
ready money business, and as the Welshmen left much of their cash
behind them, in exchange for groceries, malt, and other
commodities, the loss of such a trade may easily be conceived,
when it is said that more than six hundred pieces of web have
been sold in one day.&nbsp; The Welsh flannels were formerly made
by the rural population, and the small farmers employed their
female domestics at leisure hours in this business.&nbsp; These
seldom made more than four or five pieces during the year, and
those from the wool of their own flocks.&nbsp; The principal
manufacturers were farmers, who maintained servants solely for
that purpose, and hired weavers by the year.&nbsp; They produced
forty or fifty pieces annually at market, each measuring from 100
to 150 yards; and, as it was a ready money trade, many of them
made considerable sums.&nbsp; At present, chiefly from the
introduction of spinning mills and the power loom, this ancient
domestic manufacture is almost swept away.&nbsp; The market,
formerly held here every Thursday, is now removed to Welshpool,
Newton, and Llanidloes, which has nearly caused the total
extinction of this branch of local commerce.&nbsp; There are now
only two flannel merchants in the town, and they visit the
different localities in which the flannels are manufactured to
purchase their goods.</p>
<p>The general trade and prosperity of Shrewsbury are said to
have been very much injured by the exactions of its guilds or
incorporated companies, the most considerable of which are the
drapers and the mercers.&nbsp; The former were incorporated by
Edward IV., and united with an ancient guild or fraternity of the
Holy Trinity, founded in the church of St. Mary.&nbsp; Their
company is recognised by several subsequent acts of
parliament.&nbsp; They have now a considerable estate, originally
purchased by the voluntary contributions of the members, which is
expended in the support of the inmates of St. Mary&rsquo;s
almshouses, in liberal subscriptions to the charitable
institutions of the town, and in relief to widows and families of
deceased members.&nbsp; On the south-west side of St.
Mary&rsquo;s church is the Drapers&rsquo; Hall, a curious
half-timbered building, erected, probably, about the time of
Elizabeth.&nbsp; The large room, finely wainscotted with old oak,
contains two massive oak tables, and a fine old chest, with
richly carved ornaments.&nbsp; Portraits of the royal founder of
the company, and of Degory Watur and his spouse, decorate the
wainscot.&nbsp; Among the records of the Drapers&rsquo; Company
are the following:&mdash;&ldquo;25 Elizabeth, 1583, ordered that
no draper set out for Oswestry on Monday before six
o&rsquo;clock, on forfeiture of 6s. 8d., and that they should
wear their weapons all the way, and go in company.&nbsp; Not to
go over the Welsh Bridge before the bell tolls
six.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;27 of Elizabeth, 1585, a market was held
at Knocking, and a halfpenny paid by the drapers for every piece
of cloth bought.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;1621, agreed to buy no more
cloth in Oswestry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mercers were incorporated by Edward IV., on condition that
they should maintain a priest to sing at the altar of St. Michael
in the collegiate church of St. Chad; that they should give a
penny a week to thirteen poor men, to pray for the good estate of
the king, his family, and themselves; and also find a wax taper
to be carried before the holy sacrament on the procession of
Corpus Christi, on the celebration of which day it was customary
for all the companies to unite as their grand anniversary, and
preceded by their masters and wardens, ornamented with colours
and curious devices they attended the bailiffs and members of the
corporation, who, with the friars of the convents and the
parochial clergy, followed the holy sacrament, which was borne by
priests under a rich canopy of velvet, to a stone cross without
the town (probably that now called the Weeping Cross).&nbsp; Here
all joined in bewailing their sins, and in chanting forth
petitions for a plentiful harvest; they then returned in the same
order to the church of St. Chad, when <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>a grand mass was celebrated.&nbsp;
Three days of unbounded jollity and recreation followed this
magnificent festival.&nbsp; These were held on a piece of ground
called &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Kingsland</span>,&rdquo; where
each company had its &ldquo;arbour,&rdquo; and the several
incorporated communities, accompanied by bands of music, flags,
and devices emblematical of their craft, preceded by a
&ldquo;King&rdquo; or some other principal personage, assembled
at their respective arbours and spent the time with much
festivity.&nbsp; After the reformation the religions ceremony was
abolished, but one day of entertainment is still observed under
the denomination of the <span class="smcap">Shrewsbury
Show</span>, now held on the second Monday after Trinity
Sunday.&nbsp; Each company has still its arbour or pavilion,
adorned with the arms of the company, in which refreshments are
provided.&nbsp; These are visited by the mayor and corporation,
who used formerly to wear their robes of office upon this
occasion.&nbsp; The following is an entry from the books kept by
the bailiffs, dated 1521:&mdash;&ldquo;Wine to the Bishop of
Coventry and Lichfield, president of our lord the king&rsquo;s
council in the marches of Wales at the general procession of
Corpus Christi, 3s. 8d.&rdquo;&nbsp; The show was revived and
kept up with much pageantry in 1850.&nbsp; The ancient
<i>Tailors&rsquo; Hall</i> formerly stood on College Hill; the
<i>Weavers&rsquo; Hall</i> on Wyle Cop; the <i>Cloth
Workers&rsquo; Hall</i> in High-street, and the <i>Mercers&rsquo;
Hall</i> in the King&rsquo;s Head Shutt.&nbsp; The chief
manufactories at the present time in Shrewsbury are the extensive
establishment of Messrs. Marshall and Co., for flax spinning and
the manufacture of linen thread, where upwards of 800 operatives
are employed.&nbsp; The factory is a spacious and lofty building,
situated in St. Michael-street; the aggregate amount of steam
power employed is equal to 116 horses.&nbsp; Linen was formerly
extensively manufactured here; a linen and flax mill was taken
down about fifteen years ago; there are now only about half a
dozen hands employed in weaving linen.&nbsp; The cotton
manufacture was introduced into Shrewsbury in 1790, when several
factories were built at Coleham, and the trade was carried on in
a spirited manner.&nbsp; In 1817 the proprietor, in consequence
of a great depression in trade, declined business, since which
the mills have been closed, and some portion of them converted
into cottage tenements.&nbsp; <i>Malting</i> is very extensively
carried on, as will be seen in reference to the trades&rsquo;
list, which will show thirty different firms.&nbsp; <i>Glass
Staining</i> has been brought to the highest state of perfection
by Mr. David Evans, whose ingenious talents and consummate skill
have raised the art to a degree of perfection unequalled in
modern times.&nbsp; The beautiful specimens visible in the
restorations of Winchester and Lichfield cathedrals, in most of
the churches of Shrewsbury, and in churches almost in all parts
of the kingdom, will compare with some of the finest works of the
ancient masters, and speak his merits more forcibly to the
refined taste than whole volumes of feeble encomiums.&nbsp; There
are several <i>Iron-founderies</i>, and the manufacture of
<i>Agricultural Implements</i> is carried onto a considerable
extent, with <i>Tanning</i> and other branches of trade as will
be seen on reference to the trades&rsquo; directory.&nbsp; Among
the delicacies for which the town is noted is the <i>Shrewsbury
Cake</i>, a delicious sweet cake, which the poet Shenstone speaks
of as &ldquo;Rend&rsquo;ring through Britain&rsquo;s isle
Salopian&rsquo;s praises known.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>Simnel
Cake</i> is also much admired, and great quantities are made
about the season of Christmas.&nbsp; It consists of an exterior
crust or shell deeply tinged with saffron, enclosing a compound
of rich fruit.&nbsp; <i>The Shrewsbury Brawn</i> is highly
celebrated among the connoisseurs of this ancient Christmas
dish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Quarry</span>.&mdash;This fine public
promenade occupies a rich sloping meadow of about twenty acres,
on the west side of the town, and derives its name from a disused
stone quarry nearly in the centre, which supplied a considerable
part of the red sand stone visible in the older portions of the
walls and churches of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; An avenue of lofty lime
trees, more than five hundred yards in length, follows the
windings of the Severn; to the middle and at each end of which,
three other shaded walks lead from various parts of the
town.&nbsp; &ldquo;The still retirement and pleasing gloom of
this delightful grove, from which the noise of the busy town, and
even a prospect of its buildings, are almost entirely
excluded&mdash;the refreshing coolness of its shade&mdash;the
rich verdure which <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>ever clothes its meadow&mdash;the fine sweep of its
umbrageous arch&mdash;and the majestic flow of the river, which
here combine to render it the favourite and constant resort of
the inhabitants, and a principal attraction to the
stranger.&rdquo;&nbsp; The opposite bank of the Severn rises
abruptly, and is crowned with the House of Industry, an extensive
and handsome building, and some modern plantations, contribute
greatly to embellish the scene, and render it one of the finest
public walks in the kingdom.&nbsp; The ground was planted and
laid out during the mayoralty of Henry Jenks, Esq., in the year,
1719, previous to which it was a waste plot of land, where the
inhabitants were used to indulge in feats of wrestling, tilting
and other sports.&nbsp; In a place called the Dingle, planted
with a clump of magnificent trees, are the remains of a rude
amphitheatre, with ascending seats cut in the bank, where the
friars of the adjacent convent entertained the Salopians with
those ancient, sacred dramas, called mysteries or Whitsun plays,
so famous in the days of our ancestors.&nbsp; Here, also, during
the reign of Elizabeth, many plays were exhibited, in which the
scholars of the free school sustained the principal characters;
among which, in 1565, was a play called Julian the Apostate, and
two years afterwards was exhibited the passion of Christ.&nbsp;
It is said that the Queen herself intended to have honoured the
last with her presence, and had even arrived as far as Coventry
on her way, but hearing that it was over she returned to
London.&nbsp; The corporation in the year 1569 leased the quarry
to three persons for ten years, for the consideration of a red
rose yearly, on condition that they should bring the water from
Broadwell, near Crow Meole, in leaden pipes as high as it would
run into the town of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; By this means the water
was first brought into the town; the work was completed in the
year 1574, and then the conduits were first opened.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Horse Races</span> are held annually
in the second week in May, and continue for two days; they
attract a considerable influx of visitors to the town, but are
not so celebrated as they were in former times.&nbsp; The race
course is situated a quarter of a mile N.N.E. from the Abbey
Church, on the road leading to Monk Moor.&nbsp; It also bears the
name of &ldquo;the soldiers&rsquo; piece,&rdquo; and is pointed
out by tradition as the spot on which the unfortunate Charles I.,
when at Shrewsbury in 1642, drew up his army and addressed the
assembled gentry of the county on the subject of his
distresses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Assembly Room</span> was erected in
1777, at the back of the Lion Hotel; the room is commodious and
suitably decorated, and the balls are usually attended by the
rank and fashion of the county.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Billiard Rooms</span> are situated in
the Market-square; the third story of the Music Hall has been
divided into convenient apartments, which are now occupied as
billiard rooms, of which Mr. Edward Vaughan is the
proprietor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aquatic Excursions</span>.&mdash;Much
pleasure and healthy exercise is afforded on the Severn during
the summer months, and an emulation of skill is frequently
excited among the rowers.&nbsp; Boats may be hired at a moderate
charge, and pleasure parties frequently take an excursion up the
river to the picturesque and shady banks of Berwick and the Isle,
or to the rural village of Uffington.&nbsp; The Severn also
affords much pleasure to the votaries of the &ldquo;gentle
craft,&rdquo; the river being celebrated for the excellency of
its salmon, besides which trout, pike, grayling, perch, and many
other sorts of fish are caught.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kingsland</span> is a plot of ground
covering twenty-seven acres on the south west side of the town,
the common property of the burgesses, thirty of whom in rotation
receive annually 4s. 6d. from its produce, in lieu for a
&ldquo;turn for their kine.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is studded with small
enclosures and &ldquo;arbours,&rdquo; to which the several
incorporated trading companies of the town annually resort in
procession on the Monday after Trinity Sunday, accompanied by
bands of music and devices emblematical of their craft; a more
particular account of which has been noticed with the various
guilds.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Monastic Foundations</span>.&mdash;<i>The
Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul</i>, which stood on the eastern
banks of the Severn, in the suburb which still bears its name,
owes its foundation <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>to Roger de Montgomery, the first Norman Earl of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In the time of the Saxons it is said a church
stood on or near this spot, and a community of monks was in all
probability united to it.&nbsp; The Danes, during their ravages
in the ninth century, plundered and depopulated monastic
institutions, and this it is conjectured fell with the
rest.&nbsp; The kingdom becoming more settled under the reign of
Edgar, many of the abbey churches which had till then laid
desolate were taken possession of by secular priests, who,
swerving from the strictness of monastic life, engaged in the
active concerns of society.&nbsp; Such, apparently, was the state
of the monastery of Shrewsbury at the time of the Norman
invasion.&nbsp; The church, then a rude edifice of wood, was
governed by Odelirius, a priest, who as archpresbyter, presided
over a college of married secular clergy.&nbsp; Its district was
called the parish of the city.&nbsp; From the fact that the
portion of each prebend, at the death of the incumbent, should
revert to the monks of a new abbey, there can be no doubt that at
this period it was collegiate.&nbsp; This was the cause of much
litigation, it being customary for ecclesiastical livings to
descend as by inheritance to the next of blood.&nbsp; These
claims were, however, abolished during the reign of Henry
I.&nbsp; In the seminary belonging to this ancient church, a
priest named Seward is mentioned as an eminent teacher, and to
him the historian Ordericus Vitalis owed his education.</p>
<p>When Roger de Montgomery took possession of his territories in
Shropshire, he determined to refound the monastery, and to
introduce into it the monks of his favourite order, St. Benedict,
whom he invited over from a religious house founded on the
estates of Mabel, his first Countess, at Sees, in Normandy.&nbsp;
He obtained the land on which the monastery of Shrewsbury stood
from Siward, a Saxon nobleman, and in 1083 laid the foundation of
a magnificent abbey, which, when finished, was re-dedicated to
St. Peter and St. Paul, the patrons of the ancient
monastery.&nbsp; With the consent of his Countess, Adelaisa, he
retired to the holy solitude of his monastery and received the
tonsure and habit of a monk, on which occasion he presented the
fraternity with the tunic of Hugh, the sainted abbot of Clugin,
in Burgundy, which vestment he occasionally wore, doubtless in
anxious hope of its communicating some portion of the sanctity of
its former possessor.&nbsp; In the immediate prospect of his
dissolution he invested himself with this precious relic, thus
exemplifying the pitiable superstition of those who &ldquo;put on
the weeds of Dominic or Franciscan and think to pass
disguised.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was buried in the Lady Chapel, between
the two altars.</p>
<p>His second son, Hugh, succeeded to the Earldom of Shrewsbury,
soon after which he paid a solemn visit to the abbey, to do
homage to the tomb of his father, on which occasion, though of a
profligate and cruel character, he added greatly to the
endowments of the institution; and, among other things, conferred
on the monks the tithe of all the venison of his forests in
Shropshire, that of Wenlock excepted.&nbsp; The barons who
attended Earl Hugh, imitated his munificence and conferred large
estates on the abbey.&nbsp; By these and other acquisitions the
revenues of the house were greatly enriched, and the abbot
obtained the honour of ranking among those spiritual barons who
sat and voted in parliament, had the authority of bishops within
their houses, wore the mitre, sandals, and gloves, carried silver
crosiers in their hands, gave their episcopal benediction,
conferred the lesser orders, and in some instances were exempt
from all authority of the diocesan.&nbsp; It is uncertain when
these high functions were first exercised, but the abbot of
Shrewsbury is mentioned among the spiritual lords who voted in
parliament in the 49th of Henry III.</p>
<p>In the days of King Stephen, when the popular passion for
relics had attained an unbounded extravagance, the monks of
Shrewsbury determined not to be behindhand with their brethren in
availing themselves of so fruitful a source of opulence;
therefore, during the abbacy of Herbert, the third abbot, they
commenced business on their own account.&nbsp; After ransacking
the legends of Wales for a subject, they at length had the good
fortune to pitch upon one sufficiently absurd for their purpose,
in the bones of the martyred Virgin St. Wenefrede, which lay
interred in the churchyard at Gwytherin, in Denbighshire.&nbsp;
After much fruitless negotiation with the priest and the people
of Gwytherin, the abbot of <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Shrewsbury procured an order from
Henry I. for the translation of the sacred dust to his
monastery.&nbsp; The Welshmen honoured their saint more than
their king, and turned a deaf ear alike to entreaties and
menace.&nbsp; The Salopian monks persevering in their purpose,
held a chapter, in which Robert Pennant, their prior, a
Denbighshire man, who is supposed to have fabricated the legend,
was commissioned to make a pilgrimage to Gwytherin, and to leave
no expedients untried for obtaining possession of the
relics.&nbsp; Assisted by a priest in Wales, two clever monks of
his abbey, and the prior of Chester, he practised on the
credulity of the Welsh by pretended visions and divine
warnings.&nbsp; The prize was given up, and the delegates
returned with it in triumph to Shrewsbury, where it was enshrined
with great pomp and solemnity, near the high altar of St. Peter
and St. Paul.&nbsp; The speculation of the monks was completely
successful; multitudes of pilgrims flocked with gifts to the
shrine, and even nobles contended who should offer the richest
donations.&nbsp; In addition to these treasured bones the monks
in after times appear to have possessed a most extensive and
varied assortment of other relics, doubtless of equal value and
efficacy.&nbsp; In 1486 the abbot Thomas Mynde incorporated the
devotees of St. Wenefrede into a religions guild or fraternity,
founded by him in her honour.&nbsp; A great bell was also
dedicated to her memory.&nbsp; One of the most remarkable persons
this house produced was Robert of Shrewsbury, a monk, who was
promoted to the see of Bangor, in the reign of Henry II.&nbsp;
His influence in Wales excited the jealously of King John, who
imprisoned him in his own cathedral, and for his ransom obliged
him to pay three hundred hawks.&nbsp; This eminent prelate, it is
said by his will, ordered his body to be buried, not in his
cathedral church, but in the middle of the market place of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; At the various visits with which the English
sovereigns honoured Shrewsbury, it is highly probable that they
took up their residence in the abbey, and there can be little
doubt that the parliament of Edward I., 1283, and that of Richard
II., 1398, called the Great Parliament, were held within the
monastery.&nbsp; At the dissolution of 1513, when the property
and possessions of this monastery fell to the crown, the
burgesses of Shrewsbury presented a petition that the abbey might
be converted into a college or free school, to which request
Henry refused to accede, alleging as a reason his intention of
erecting Shrewsbury into a bishopric, the diocese of which was to
include the counties of Salop and Staffordshire, and the
endowments to consist of the monastic revenues.&nbsp; Dr.
Bouchier, the last abbot of Leicester, was actually nominated
Bishop of Shrewsbury, and hence it is said arose the appellation
&ldquo;Proud Salopians,&rdquo; founded on the tradition that the
inhabitants rejected the offer of having their borough converted
into a city.&nbsp; The bailiffs and principal inhabitants of the
city in vain petitioned their monarch to spare the buildings of
the monastery.&nbsp; On the 22nd of July, 1546, Henry VIII.
granted the site of the dissolved abbey to Edward Watson and
Henry Henderson, who the next day conveyed the same to William
Langley, a tailor, in whose family it continued for five
generations, until 1701, when Jonathan Langley, Esq., devised it
to Edward Baldwyn, Esq., and he in like manner in 1726 passed it
to his sister Bridget, wife of Thomas Powys, Esq.&nbsp; In 1810
the premises were sold by the trustees of the wife of Thomas Jelf
Powys, Esq., to Mr. Simon Hiles, in whose devisees they are now
vested.&nbsp; The property with which the abbey had been endowed
at various periods, comprised seventy manors, twenty-four
churches, and the tithes of thirty-seven parishes, besides very
extensive and valuable privileges and immunities of various
kinds.&nbsp; In 26 Henry VIII., their possessions were found of
the yearly value of &pound;572. 15s. 5&frac34;d., equal to
&pound;4700 in the present day.&nbsp; Pensions were assigned to
the late abbot, Thomas Boteler, and the seventeen monks.</p>
<p>The abbey presents few features of its ancient grandeur, the
chapter house, cloister, and refectory are entirely
destroyed.&nbsp; In the stately chapter house occurred the early
authorised assembly of that popular representation in the
constitution of this kingdom, to which, under Providence,
Englishmen have been indebted for much of their subsequent
prosperity.&nbsp; From the important state affairs which were
transacted here in 1307&ndash;8 it was <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>denominated the Great
Parliament.&nbsp; The cross of Canterbury was brought here, upon
which the lords spiritual and temporal were sworn to observe and
keep all the statutes which were then made.&nbsp; Here too,
Richard II., attended by a numerous guard of Cheshire men,
entertained the members of his parliament with a sumptuous
feast.&nbsp; The site of the abbey embraced upwards of ten acres,
but it is no longer possible to trace the wide circuit of the
ancient embattled walls.&nbsp; In 1836, on excavating near the
site of the chapter house, a leaden seal was found, which had
once been appended to a bull from the pope, whose name is thus
inscribed on it:&mdash;INNOCENTUS.&nbsp; P.P.&nbsp; IIII.&nbsp;
The most interesting portions of the ruins is a little octagonal
structure, six feet in diameter, which is generally called the
Stone Pulpit, the admiration of every antiquary and person of
taste.&nbsp; Some broken steps lead to the interior through a
narrow flat arched door on each side.&nbsp; The south part stands
upon a portion of a ruined wall, and originally looked into one
of the outer courts.&nbsp; The corresponding moiety projected
considerably within the hall, and rests upon a single corbel,
terminating in a head.&nbsp; From this point it gradually
spreads, with a variety of delicately ribbed mouldings, until it
forms the basement under the floor.&nbsp; The whole is crowned
with a dome of stone work, at about eight feet from the base,
supported on six narrow pointed arches, rising from pillars
similar to the mullions of the windows.&nbsp; One of the
remaining sides of the octagon is a solid blank wall, and the
other contains the door.&nbsp; The roof within is vaulted on
eight delicate ribs springing out of the wall, and adorned at
their intersection in the centre, by a boss representing an open
flower, on which is displayed a delicate sculpture of the
crucifixion.&nbsp; The spaces between the divisions of the three
northern arches, are filled up four feet above the base, with
stone panels, over which they are entirely open, and the light
thus introduced is productive of a beautiful effect.&nbsp; On the
centre panel is a rich piece of sculpture designed to represent
the annunciation.&nbsp; The right hand panel bears the images of
St. Peter and St. Paul; that on the left St. Wenefrede and the
abbot Beuno.&nbsp; The architecture of this interesting structure
is referred to the time of Henry VIII.&nbsp; Much conjecture has
arisen among antiquaries respecting its probable use, but there
can be little doubt that it originally projected from the wall of
the refectory, and was used as a pulpit, from which one of the
junior brethren of the monastery, in compliance with the rule of
the Benedictine order, daily read or recited aloud, during meal
times, a subject of divinity to the monks during dinner.&nbsp;
Southward from the pulpit is a range of red sand stone building,
now incorporated with the abbey house.&nbsp; To the south east is
the abbot lodge, of which the only remnant is a portion of the
cloister, consisting of three pointed arches.&nbsp; The dormitory
was cut through on the formation of a new line of road in
1836.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Shrewsbury Castle</span>.&mdash;The events
which belong to the Castle are intimately connected with the
history of the town, where they are more fully noticed.&nbsp; Its
founder, Roger de Montgomery, made it his residence soon after
the Conquest, and it became the chief seat of his baronial
power.&nbsp; As his new possessions had been acquired by the
sword, Earl Roger considered the inhabitants as his property;
therefore, to afford an eligible site for his new buildings, he
is stated to have destroyed fifty houses; a fifth part of the
town at that period.&nbsp; After the fall of the great house of
Montgomery, in the reign of Henry I., on the forfeiture of Earl
Robert de Belesme, the Castle became a royal fortress.&nbsp; Its
defence was entrusted to a constable, usually the sheriff, who
maintained the prison of the county within its walls; and the
vast possessions annexed to it were parcelled out among various
knights, on the condition of their keeping castle-ward for a
certain number of days during war.&nbsp; During the turbulent
reign of Henry III. the castle fell into great dilapidation; but
his son, Edward I., immediately on his accession, almost entirely
rebuilt the structure.&nbsp; The stronger portion of the castle
now remaining was probably erected by direction of that monarch,
being in the style generally adopted during his reign.</p>
<p>It was at this time considered rather as a place of great
consequence in protecting the country from the invasions of the
Welsh, than as a royal or baronial residence.&nbsp; By the union
with Wales all apprehensions on this ground vanished, and the
importance of the <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>castle as a fortress ceased.&nbsp; In the time of Henry
VIII. it seems to have been rapidly hastening to decay.&nbsp;
Leland, who then saw it, observes that it had been a
&ldquo;stronge thynge, but now much in mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
reign of Elizabeth, a grant was made of its site and buildings to
Richard Onslow, Esq., who subsequently transferred his interest
in it to the corporation.</p>
<p>During the civil war, in the reign of Charles I., the Castle
resumed some share of its former importance, and was garrisoned
for the royal party.&nbsp; The dilapidated walls were repaired,
and its gates strongly fortified.&nbsp; After its surrender to
the parliamentary forces, in 1645, it escaped the destruction
that fell upon many other castles, owing to the circumstance of
its being entrusted by the House of Commons to the government of
Colonel Mitton, a native of the county, who, displeased with the
virulent persecution of the king, soon after resigned his
commission.&nbsp; Colonel Mackworth was then appointed governor,
and he was succeeded by Colonel Hunt.&nbsp; On the restoration of
Charles II., the property of the Castle returned to the
burgesses, who in 1663 surrendered it to the king.&nbsp; That
monarch shortly afterwards presented it to Viscount Newport,
afterwards Earl of Bradford.&nbsp; The garrison at this time
consisted of two companies with their officers; the daily
expenses of which, as given in an old record, are stated at
&pound;8. 17s., or &pound;3,230. 5s. per annum.&nbsp; The Castle
continued in a fortified state, and had a large magazine of arms,
which was not removed till the reign of James II.&nbsp; It is
probable that the out-works were in a great measure destroyed,
and its ancient chapel demolished, about this period.&nbsp; The
part still remaining was leased by the Earl of Bradford to Mr.
Gosnell.&nbsp; About the year 1730, this gentleman converted it
into a gloomy habitation, in which state it remained until Sir
William Pulteney repaired and greatly improved it.&nbsp; The
outer walls of the Castle are now undergoing a complete
reparation by the present proprietor, the Duke of Cleveland.</p>
<p>The Castle stands boldly elevated on a considerable eminence
on the narrow isthmus formed by the windings of the Severn, which
in every other part, by surrounding Shrewsbury, formed a portion
of its defence.&nbsp; It has undergone so many changes, and has
suffered so much from the dilapidations of time, that it is not
easy to form any correct notion of its original state.&nbsp; Its
appearance does not convey an adequate idea of the size,
stateliness, or the strength of a great baronial fortress, placed
in so important a position as Shrewsbury was once esteemed.&nbsp;
The present buildings are of red free stone, and consist of the
keep, the walls of the inner court, and the great arch of the
interior gate.&nbsp; How far the original fortifications extended
cannot now be absolutely determined.&nbsp; It is probable that
the usual appendages of feudal castles, the outer court or
ballium, with its strong gate, portcullis, and towers, once made
part of the fortress, and extended, perhaps, beyond the Council
House.&nbsp; The keep is a square building of great strength,
connected with two round towers, embattled and pierced, and
originally consisted of one great apartment on each of the upper
floors.&nbsp; The interior as well as the exterior has been
greatly altered.&nbsp; In the vestibule is a statue of the
founder, Roger de Montgomery.&nbsp; A handsome stone staircase,
of modern construction, leads from the vestibule to the principal
apartments.&nbsp; The drawing room, a spacious and handsome
apartment, was used as a guard chamber in the time of Charles
I.&nbsp; A narrow stone staircase within the wall, lighted by
chinks, leads to an apartment in the western tower, in which was
a recess, with a strong groined ceiling, and small sharp pointed
windows.&nbsp; This building does not appear older than the time
of Henry III.; the beams are of an immense size, and the walls
are ten feet in thickness.&nbsp; The battlements of the walls are
pierced with narrow cruciform openings, called loops or oilets,
which were intended for the convenience of the
cross-bowmen.&nbsp; The noble arch of the gateway is the only
existing part of the original Norman fortress of Roger de
Montgomery.&nbsp; It is eighteen feet high, semi-circular, and
with plain round facings; and its walls appear to have sustained
a tower, from which hung the portcullis.&nbsp; On the east side
of the court is a postern, built probably in the time of Charles
I., when <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>the fortress was restored; and near it are the massive
foundations of an ancient tower.&nbsp; The Castle still retains
one mark of its ancient dignity, for in the area of the inner
court the knights of the shire are nominated, and from time
immemorial have been girt with their swords by the sheriff.</p>
<p>On the south side of the court is a lofty mount, which rises
abruptly from the Severn, the summit of which is crowned with
ruinous walls, and an ancient watch tower for the purpose of
descrying an enemy at a distance.&nbsp; This was rebuilt about
thirty years ago, and converted into a beautiful summer room,
commanding a fine panoramic view, and now called Laura&rsquo;s
Tower.&nbsp; From the above mount there is also a view of
uncommon grandeur and beauty&mdash;the sides of the mount are
richly clothed with foliage, the Severn winds majestically
below&mdash;the eye of the spectator beholds in succession, the
town, with its spires and turrets, its beautiful suburbs, and a
wide sweep of finely wooded and diversified country, with the
most extensive amphitheatre of mountains of which perhaps the
island can boast.&nbsp; The majestic Wrekin is connected by the
hills of Acton Burnell and Frodesley with the towering heights of
the Lawley and Caradoc, from whence the Long Mynd, Stiperstones,
and Long Mountain, form an uninterrupted chain, with the bold and
precipitous cliffs of Kefn-y-Castyr and Breddyn;&mdash;thence the
horizon is bounded by the stupendous Berwin range, losing its
blue summit in the clouds,&mdash;while the northern prospect is
terminated by the humbler eminences of Grinshill, Pymhill,
Hawkstone, and Haughmond.</p>
<p>When the frontier situation of Shrewsbury is considered, and
that for four centuries it was, perhaps, the most important
station on the marches of Wales, it is extraordinary that, though
it has several times fallen into the enemies&rsquo; power by
treachery and surprise, yet it never sustained more than two
sieges, and those in rather early periods of its history.&nbsp;
This circumstance may partly be attributed to the slender hopes
an adverse army must have entertained of reducing by regular
approaches a place so strongly fortified both by nature and art;
for it was not only defended by its castle, but by the river, and
a wall which completely surrounded it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Town Walls</span>.&mdash;The following
account of the ancient walls of Shrewsbury is chiefly taken from
Phillip&rsquo;s history of the town:&mdash;The walls were built
across the isthmus, from the castle down to the river on each
side, by Robert de Belesme, son of Roger de Montgomery.&nbsp; The
other part of the walls surrounding the town was built in the
reign of Henry III., who earnestly pressed the inhabitants to
fortify and strengthen their borough, lest the enemy should
surprise them unawares.&nbsp; This part of the wall was
thirty-two years in building; it was finished in 1252, to defray
the charge of which the king, at sundry times, granted the
burgesses leases of the tolls of the town, and other favours;
among which, every barge laded with merchandise upon the river
had to pay the charge of fourpence.&nbsp; That part from the
north end of the above-mentioned wall to the Welsh bridge, called
Roushill, was built by Oliver Cromwell in the year 1645, the
stone of which was brought from Shrawardine Castle.&nbsp; The
more accessible parts of the town walls, particularly on the
south and south-western sides, were formerly strengthened by
towers, which are now demolished, excepting one, situated near
the Murivance; it is square, embattled, and of two stories high,
lighted by narrow loop holes, the entrance of the upper story
being from the top wall.&nbsp; The only portions of the ancient
walls now left standing are those on the north side of the town,
extending from the Castle gates towards the Welsh bridge, and on
the south-west side, where they stretch to a considerable
distance.&nbsp; Although reduced in height, and stripped of the
battlements, they form an agreeable walk to the inhabitants of
the town.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gates and Posterns</span>.&mdash;In an
exchequer manuscript, without date, several gates or posterns are
mentioned, to the keepers of which the coroners of the town
delivered bolts and locks for their security.&nbsp; Those at
Shepelache and at Kaymeplace no traces of the names remain.&nbsp;
That called Bulgerlode was under the place formerly called the
Gulph, at <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>the bottom of the Wyle Cop, and Cleremont, on the top of
Claremont Hill.&nbsp; There were also gates in Milk Street,
Barker Street, and Water Lane.&nbsp; The latter only remains, and
is memorable as the avenue through which the parliamentary forces
were treacherously admitted into the town, at the siege of
Shrewsbury, on February 22nd, 1644.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Streets</span>, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
following are some of the ancient names of the principal streets
given in Phillips&rsquo; History of Shrewsbury, many of which
have become obsolete.</p>
<p><i>Mardol</i>, anciently written Marlesford, Mardefoie, and
Mardvoll.&nbsp; It had the name of Marlesford from the ford
through the Severn at the bottom of the street, near the welsh
bridge.</p>
<p><i>Chepynges-street</i>.&mdash;An ancient name probably of the
street leading from the Corn Market to Murivance.</p>
<p><i>Stalles</i>.&mdash;The street leading from Mardol head to
High-street.</p>
<p><i>High-street</i>, formerly called Baxter&rsquo;s-row, also
Barker&rsquo;s-row.</p>
<p><i>Ickeslode</i>.&mdash;A lane that went from Dogpole to the
Walls.</p>
<p><i>The Sextry</i> was the Shutt from the passage from
Kiln-lane to High-street.</p>
<p><i>Frankwell</i>, anciently Frankvill; the Frank&rsquo;s Vill,
probably inhabited by the Franks, for in Doomsday book it is
recorded that a part of the town containing 45 Burgase were
inhabited by those people, who are there called
<i>Francigence</i>.&mdash;This place seems to have been regarded
as unconnected with the other part of the town; they had a strong
work erected there for their defence, which at the time
Shrewsbury was taken by the parliamentary forces surrendered upon
bare quarter; and in the year 1640, when the plague began there,
the inhabitants made an attempt to come into the town, but were
beaten back by the bailiffs and townsmen.</p>
<p><i>Cheddelode</i>.&mdash;A lane that went to the Severn, by
Stury&rsquo;s Close.</p>
<p><i>Bulgerlode</i>.&mdash;A place at the bottom of the Wyle
Cop, taken down in 1766.</p>
<p><i>Murivance</i>.&mdash;A name of French extraction signifying
before the walls, or within the walls.</p>
<p><i>Murivance-lane</i>, led from the town wall down to the
river.</p>
<p><i>Sheteplace</i>, in old records written Sotteplace, and
Soetteplace, is now called Shoplatch.&nbsp; <i>Behind the
Walls</i>, from its situation behind the walls, now the
Quarry.</p>
<p><i>Priest&rsquo;s-lane</i>, led from the walls near the tower,
to Murivance, now inclosed.</p>
<p><i>Romboldesham</i>, now called Barber-street.</p>
<p><i>The Bailey</i>.&mdash;That part of the town which lies
before the castle.</p>
<p><i>Hound-street</i>.&mdash;A street leading from the playhouse
to Barber-street.</p>
<p><i>Grope-lane</i>.&mdash;A narrow &ldquo;shutt&rdquo; leading
from High-street to Fish street.</p>
<p><i>Corvisor&rsquo;s-row</i>.&mdash;The same as that which is
now called Pride-hill.</p>
<p><i>Shoemakers&rsquo;-row</i>.&mdash;In Speed&rsquo;s map the
lower part of Pride-hill.</p>
<p><i>Hawmon-strete</i>.&mdash;Probably that now called
Castle-street, or Raven-street.</p>
<p><i>Merival</i>.&mdash;At the east end of the New bridge.&nbsp;
Early in the 16th century, Merival was separated from the
jurisdiction of the corporation, and considered a hamlet within
the liberty of the town.</p>
<p><i>Altus Vicus</i>.&mdash;The high pavement, near the Cross
made in 1570.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ancient Mansions</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">The Council House</span>, was so called from having
been the residence of the Council of the Marches of Wales, during
their occasional visits to Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It is situated in
the precincts of the Castle, on a bold acclivity which rises
abruptly from the Severn, and commands a most delightful prospect
of the surrounding country.&nbsp; The house has been modernized,
and divided into several tenements; that portion which comprises
the hall and the great chamber over it, includes nearly the whole
of the building which retains any resemblance of its original
features.&nbsp; It was built about the year 1501.&nbsp; The
unhappy Charles I. resided here for six weeks, upon the
commencement of his troubles in 1642.&nbsp; James II. on his
visit to the town 24th August, 1687, held his court here.&nbsp;
These once magnificent apartments have been subdivided and
despoiled of their rich furniture and beautiful stained
glass.&nbsp; A fine old porch, and the entrance <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>hall with
other relics have been carefully preserved.&nbsp; The present
proprietor, William James Clement, Esq., has furnished several of
the apartments with antique oak furniture, elaborately
carved.&nbsp; The gateway of the council house is an interesting
specimen of the style of architecture which prevailed in the
early part of the 15th century.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The White Hall</span>, situated near the
Abbey Foregate, is a stately mansion, and exhibits a fine
specimen of the Elizabethan style of architecture.&nbsp; It is a
lofty structure with numerous pointed gables; the roof is adorned
with ornamental chimnies, and crowned with a central octagonal
turret.&nbsp; At the back of the mansion is a magnificent walnut
tree, probably coeval with the house.&nbsp; It was formerly the
manorial seat of Richard Prince, Esq., by whom it was built in
1758.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rowley&rsquo;s</span>, on <span
class="smcap">Hill&rsquo;s Mansion</span>, said to have been the
first brick building erected in Shrewsbury, was built in 1618, by
William Rowley, Esq.&nbsp; He amassed great wealth by fortunate
speculations in Barbadoes.&nbsp; His son, Roger Rowley, Esq., was
the first person in this town who kept his carriage.&nbsp; The
daughter and heiress of the latter married John Hill, Esq., who
lived in this mansion, from whom the street received the
appellation of <i>Hill&rsquo;s-lane</i>, instead of
Knuckin-street.&nbsp; The house has been unoccupied some time, it
now presents a dilapidated appearance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ireland&rsquo;s Mansion</span>, situated
in High-street, a noble timbered residence four stories high,
terminating in pointed gables, was formerly the town residence of
the ancient family of Ireland, long seated at Albrighton.&nbsp;
When entire it must have presented an imposing appearance; it is
now divided into three excellent tenements.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jones&rsquo;s Mansion</span>, situate near
St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, was built by Thomas Jones, Esq., who was
appointed by Charles I. in 1638 the first mayor of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Subsequently the mansion became the residence
of Chief Justice Jones.&nbsp; The Duke of York was lodged here in
1624, during the stay of Charles I. in Shrewsbury, and Prince
Rupert made it his residence after the battle of Worcester.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Judges&rsquo; Lodgings</span>,
situated at Belmont, is a spacious residence purchased by the
county in 1821, for providing suitable accommodation for the
Judges during their attendance at the assizes.</p>
<p>In various parts of the town are seen many curious old
timbered houses, interesting as specimens of the domestic
architecture of the honest burghers of former days.&nbsp; Nearly
opposite the Butter Cross stood the mansion of the Prides, who
gave their name to the street.&nbsp; This house has been greatly
modernized, and partly rebuilt.&nbsp; In the Butchers&rsquo;-row,
is one of the largest, and supposed to be one of the oldest
timber houses in the town.&nbsp; History is silent as to the time
or by whom it was erected.&nbsp; It may have been the town
mansion of the Abbot of Lilleshall, who had a residence in this
part of the parish, and to which monastery the patronage of this
church belonged.</p>

<p>1762.&mdash;A great fire happened in New-street, Frankwell, on
the 23rd February.</p>
<p>1766.&mdash;February 12th, 13th, and 14th, there fell a great

eighteen inches deep.</p>
<p>1772.&mdash;A smart shock of an earthquake was felt, which
occasioned much terror and consternation.</p>
<p>1774.&mdash;On Good Friday, April 1st, a fire broke out in the
Abbey Foregate, by which forty-seven houses were burnt down, and
several others much damaged.</p>
<p>1775.&mdash;September 8th, the inhabitants were much alarmed
with the shock of an earthquake; in the midst of a calm a
rumbling noise much like that of a strong wind was heard; this
was soon followed by two tremulous motions of the earth,
succeeding each other instantaneously.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>1778.&mdash;The Shropshire militia marched from
Shrewsbury on May 7 to Bridgnorth, where they were reviewed; from
thence they marched into Kent.</p>

property.</p>
<p>1793.&mdash;May 13th, the first stone of the new Welsh bridge
was laid.</p>
<p>1794.&mdash;April 28th, John Pritchard died in Frankwell in
the 101st year of his age; he had ten children by the first wife,
and twenty-two by the second.</p>
<p>1795.&mdash;February 7th to 11th, one of the greatest floods
ever remembered in the Severn; Mr. Johnson and his man were both
drowned in endeavouring to recover a large barrel.</p>
<p>1802.&mdash;A sturgeon eight feet six inches long, three feet
four inches in girth, and weighing 192lbs. was caught near the

<p>1809.&mdash;February 7.&nbsp; The suburbs of the town deeply
inundated by the Severn.</p>
<p>1811.&mdash;May 27th.&nbsp; An extraordinary flood in the
Meole Brook, which inundated all the houses in Coleham, situated
near the confluence of the brook with the river Severn, and
caused the latter river to rise four feet in less than ten
minutes; although the Meole Brook is an inconsiderable stream,
the rush of water actually turned the current of the Severn at
its confluence with that river.</p>
<p>1811.&mdash;August 24th.&nbsp; Four persons executed on the
new drop for a burglary at Betton, near Market Drayton.</p>
<p>1814.&mdash;June 30th.&nbsp; Lord Hill paid a visit to

On the 17th of December the first stone was laid of the column in
honour of Lord Hill.</p>
<p>1827.&mdash;July 19th.&nbsp; First stone of the new infirmary
laid by General Lord Hill; opened for the reception of patients
September, 1830.</p>
<p>1828.&mdash;August 4th.&nbsp; Three persons executed on the
new drop of the county gaol for murder.&nbsp; On the 24th of the
same month Ann Harris was executed for the same offence.</p>
<p>1831.&mdash;February 10th.&nbsp; In consequence of the sudden
melting of the snow, the suburbs of the town were deeply
inundated.</p>
<p>Though the flood in 1831 was considered a very high one,
according to evidence of brass plates affixed to the inside of
the window jambs of a house in Frankwell, the Severn at that end
of the town was 3&frac12; inches lower than the great flood in
1795.&nbsp; The lowest plate bears the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is to let you know<br />
The Severn up to me did flow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; December 21, anno 1672.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second plate two inches above the preceding,
records&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To this line flowed Severn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; November 8, 1770.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the third plate six inches higher than the second is
inscribed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This plate is fixed to let you know<br />
That Severn to this line did flow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; February 11, 1795.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1832.&mdash;The cholera morbus in its destructive career
through the kingdom visited Shrewsbury, when about a hundred
persons fell victims to that direful malady.</p>
<p>1849.&mdash;The cholera again made its appearance in
Shrewsbury; the fatal cases were fewer than in 1832.</p>

82</span>CHARITIES.</h3>
<p><i>Sir Thomas White</i>, in 1566, bequeathed certain monies
for charitable uses, in respect of which &pound;100 is annually
paid to twenty-four corporate towns in rotation (Salop being
one), to be lent out, without interest, for a period of ten
years, to poor young men of the said towns.</p>
<p><i>Robert Allen</i>, by will 24th August, 1568, bequeathed
&pound;200 to be lent out to the poor inhabitants of the town of
Salop, in sums of &pound;10, to be held for three years; each
recipient to find a bondsman for the repayment of the same at the
expiration of the term, and to pay 4d. per annum, to be divided
among the inmates of the almshouses of St. Mary and St. Chad.</p>
<p><i>Paul Clarke</i>, April 15th, 1606, bequeathed &pound;20 to
be lent out, in sums of &pound;10, to persons of his name and
kindred only for the space of two years, and then to be returned
to the bailiffs of the town, to be again put forth by the said
bailiffs, from time to time, on sufficient security being given
for the repayment of the same.</p>
<p><i>Sir Samuel Jones</i>, by will, dated 10th March, 1670, gave
to the town of Shrewsbury &pound;500, to be employed for the
setting poor people on work there, which sum he directed should
he paid to the mayor and corporation of the said town, and should
be by them, from time to time, lent on good security, without
interest, to young tradesmen who should set up there.</p>
<p><i>Rev. John Hilton</i>, in 1697, bequeathed &pound;50 in
trust to the mayor and corporation, to be lent out to five young
tradesmen of the town, &pound;10 to each, for the term of five
years, interest free.</p>
<p>The foregoing abstracts are taken from the recitals in a
decree of the Court of Chancery, made in the year 1772, in a
cause between the attorney-general and the mayor, aldermen, and
burgesses, of the town of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; By this decree it was
ordered that the sum of &pound;2,404. 14s. 6d., found to be in
the hands of the corporation, should be apportioned to the
preceding charities, in a ratio proportionate to their several
bequests.&nbsp; It appears that shortly after these proceedings
in Chancery, the whole of the funds of these charities were lost;
that a sum exceeding &pound;3,000 was raised by subscription to
replace the money so lost, which was subsequently repaid to the
subscribers by the corporation.&nbsp; In addition to the above
sum found to be in the hands of the corporation, two sums of
&pound;100 each have been since received from Sir Thomas
White&rsquo;s charity, leaving &pound;2,596. 5s. 3d. in the hands
of the corporation to be accounted for.&nbsp; In lending out the
different sums of money, particular attention is paid to the
directions of the several donors.&nbsp; No applications for loans
are refused, provided the parties are properly qualified, and
sufficient securities are proposed.</p>
<p><i>David Lloyd ap Rogers</i>, by will, bearing date May 1st,
1623, devised certain premises at Frankwell, in trust to the
bailiffs and burgesses of the town of Shrewsbury, and directed
out of the yearly income thereof, 10s. to be paid to the minister
of St. Chad, 10s. to be employed in repairing the bridges in
Shrewsbury, 10s. to be expended in repairing Buttington bridge,
in the county of Montgomery, and the residue thereof to be
distributed to the poor of the parish of St. Chad.&nbsp; The
premises now consist of two tenements, the estimated value of
which is upwards of &pound;30 per annum.</p>
<p><i>Henry Smith&rsquo;s Charity</i>.&mdash;The corporation are
in possession of an estate in Chelmick, purchased with part of
the personal property given by Henry Smith for charitable
uses.&nbsp; It consists of a farm house, outbuildings, and
129<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>.
15<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land.&nbsp; In 1805, upon the
enclosure of the waste lands, an allotment was set out to the
corporation; but the situation was remote from the remainder of
the farm, and it was accordingly sold for &pound;201. 10s.;
&pound;100 of which was subsequently laid out in improving the
farm, and the residue put out at interest.&nbsp; The income
arising from the above sources amounts to &pound;85. 1s. 6d.,
which is carried to the Burlton estate account.</p>
<p>In an old book of accounts, belonging to the corporation of
Shrewsbury, there is an entry stating that gifts and legacies had
been given to the poor of the town of Shrewsbury <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>previously to
the year 1663, amounting in the whole to &pound;1,301. 11s.
11d.&nbsp; The principal legacy is one of &pound;300, left by
William Spurstow.&nbsp; Six other donors left legacies of
&pound;100 each, and the remainder is made up of smaller
items.&nbsp; In the whole there are names given of twenty-four
several donors.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;1,200 was laid out in the
purchase of an estate at Burlton.&nbsp; In 1796 a sum of
&pound;925, which arose from the sale of timber on the estate,
was laid out in the purchase of the tithes of corn, grain, and
hay, in the said parish.&nbsp; In 1829, the sum of &pound;264.
12s. was received for timber cut on the estate; and in the same
year &pound;266. 9s. was expended in rebuilding and improving the
farm premises, &pound;50 of which had been advanced by the
tenant.&nbsp; The income derived from the Burlton estate and the
farm at Chelmick, belonging to the charity of Henry Smith,
amounts to &pound;297. 7s. 6d. per annum.&nbsp; The principal
part of this income is applied in putting out apprentices, with a
premium of &pound;10 each, and in distributing coals among the
necessitous poor.</p>
<p><i>James Phillips</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, of London, in 1661,
devised certain tenements in the borough of Southwark, in trust
to the corporation of Shrewsbury, out of the rents and profits
thereof, to maintain a lecture on the Thursday in every week in
the year, in the parish churches of Ellesmere, Oswestry,
Whitchurch, and Shrewsbury; such lectures to be delivered by able
and orthodox divines.&nbsp; The residue of the said rents to be
expended in gowns or clothes for the poor people of the said
parishes.&nbsp; In 1825, the corporation sold two tenements,
situated in the parish of St. Saviour, left by the same donor,
for the sum of &pound;1,685, which was laid out in the purchase
of &pound;2,146. 10s. three per cent. consols.&nbsp; Out of the
income, amounting to &pound;232. 7s. 10d. per annum, there has
been appropriated for many years &pound;10 per annum to the
officiating ministers of Ellesmere, Oswestry, Whitchurch, and
Shrewsbury; and the residue is expended in flannel, and
distributed among the poor of the above-mentioned parishes.</p>
<p><i>Edward Donne</i>, in 1668, bequeathed &pound;200, and
directed his executors to dispose of the same in the purchase of
lands, and lay out the yearly proceeds in apprentice fees, upon
poor children born in the parishes of St. Chad, St. Mary, St.
Alkmund, and St. Julian.&nbsp; It appears the amount was invested
in a rent charge of &pound;10 per annum, arising from certain
lands situated at Bulchey, Bryn-y-Koppall, and Wollaston.&nbsp;
Dr. Gardiner took possession of this property under the will of
his father, in 1801, and considerable arrears were allowed to
accumulate in his hands.&nbsp; He, however, in March, 1801,
offered to discharge the arrears by paying &pound;60 a-year till
the whole were liquidated, and to pay the amount of the rent
charge in future to the corporation.</p>
<p><i>William Jones</i>.&mdash;From an entry in one of the books
of the Company of Drapers, in the town of Shrewsbury, under the
date of March, 1653, we learn that William Jones conveyed the
manor of Wigmore, in the parish of Westbury, upon trust, that
there should yearly be paid out of the said premises &pound;11.
6s. 8d. to the master warden and assistants; &pound;10 thereof to
be yearly distributed among the most necessitous poor of the town
of Salop, more especially those dwelling in the parishes of St.
Mary and St. Alkmund.&nbsp; The residue, &pound;1. 6s. 8d., to be
paid to the Vicar of St. Alkmund, for reading morning
prayers.</p>
<p><i>Widow Baugh</i> bequeathed twenty marks per annum;
one-third thereof for the better maintenance of the minister of
St. Chad, and the other two parts to the relief of the poor of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Certain lands in Preston Montford are charged
with the payment of the twenty marks, or &pound;13. 6s. 8d.,
one-third of which has been paid to the minister of St. Chad, and
two-thirds thereof to the directors of the House of Industry for
the united parishes of the town of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; [We conceive
that the two-thirds of the annuity which has usually been paid to
the directors of the House of Industry, in aid of the parish
rates, ought to be discontinued; and the amount distributed among
proper objects of charity in the town of Shrewsbury, according to
the intentions of the donor.]</p>
<p><i>John Allatt</i>, by will, bearing date 7th April, 1792,
after bequeathing certain legacies directed all his personal
estate, not specifically disposed of, to be held in trust, to
apply <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>such
sums as the trustees should think proper in the erection of a
school house and residences for the teachers; and the residue to
be invested in government stock, to be applied in support of the
school.&nbsp; By a codicil to his will, dated October 31st, 1796,
he directed &pound;1,600 to be invested in the three per cent.
consols, the dividends thereof to be expended in the purchase of
gowns for poor widows, poor single women not less than the age of
40 years, and coats for poor men of the age of 50 years and
upwards.&nbsp; The testator died in 1796, and the school
buildings were erected in 1800, at an expense of upwards of
&pound;1,500.&nbsp; In addition to the sum laid out in erecting
the school premises, &pound;4,497. 4s. was laid out in the
purchase of three per cent. consols, and also the sum of
&pound;1,600 left for the purpose of providing clothing for the
poor.&nbsp; With the former, &pound;8,743 stock was purchased;
and with the latter, &pound;3,257.&nbsp; Subsequent purchases
have been made with the surplus of the income; and a legacy of
&pound;45 left for the same use, by the will of <i>Sarah
Mason</i>, in 1809.&nbsp; There is, therefore, now a capital of
&pound;14,000, of which the dividends of &pound;10,800 are
appropriated as the educational fund, and &pound;3,400 as the
clothing fund.</p>
<p><i>Sarah Darley</i>, by will, 29th January, 1821, bequeathed
&pound;100 upon trust, and directed the yearly produce should be
applied in the purchase of four tons of coals, for the use and
benefit of all the prisoners who might be confined in the county
gaol of Shrewsbury; and that the residue should be applied in aid
of the prison charity.&nbsp; And she further bequeathed
&pound;500, to be placed out at interest by her executors, and
the interest applied in releasing one or more debtor or debtors
who should be confined in the gaol of Shrewsbury, but who,
through misfortune, is forced into confinement; and that
particular regard should he paid to those whose families should
be suffering from their confinement.</p>
<p><i>Esther Jones</i>, by will, dated 2nd July, 1823, bequeathed
to the treasurer for the time being of the county of Salop,
&pound;300 three per cent. consols, upon trust, to apply the
dividends towards the relief of the industrious poor prisoners,
who should, from time to time, be confined in Salop gaol.</p>
<p>Upon a table, containing the benefactions to poor prisoners,
it is stated that <i>Isaac Hawkins</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, bequeathed
&pound;100, in 1803; <i>Rowland Hunt</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, in 1810,
gave &pound;25; and that <i>Mrs. Knight</i> gave &pound;25.&nbsp;
In respect of Hawkins&rsquo; gift, there is a sum of &pound;189.
11s. 6d. three per cent. consols, the dividends of which amount
to &pound;5. 13s. 8d.; and in respect of the two latter
benefactions, the sum of &pound;75. 3s. 9d., three per cent.
consols, producing &pound;2. 5s. yearly.&nbsp; The amount of
these subscriptions is paid over to the treasurer of the prison
charities, and is added to subscriptions raised for the purpose
of enabling debtors to gain a livelihood while in confinement, to
reward them for good behaviour, and to furnish them with
implements on quitting prison to support themselves and their
families; and also to encourage industry and good behaviour in
criminal prisoners, and to furnish them with the means of
returning home.&nbsp; The subscriptions usually amount to upwards

and if she should marry, or dispose of the said annuity, the
proceeds should thenceforth be applied for the benefit of the
Infirmary of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The testator also devised to
another person a copyhold messuage and premises in Twickenham for

<h3>PARISH OF ST. CHAD.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Millington&rsquo;s Hospital</span>.&mdash;<i>James
Millington</i>, by his will, bearing date 8th February, 1734,
devised the greater part of his ample fortune for the erection
and endowment of an hospital and free school.&nbsp; The hospital
is pleasantly situated upon elevated ground in Frankwell, and
consists of a handsome pedimented front with a stone portico; the
central portion comprises the chapel and school room, and the
houses of the master and mistress, and in the wings on each side
are the apartments of the hospitallers.&nbsp; The property
purchased by the trustees in 1753 and 1794 is wholly situated in
the parish of Llanvair Waterdine, in the county of Salop, and in
the parish of Beguildy, in the county of Radnor, except an estate
of 15<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>.
9<span class="smcap">p</span>., situate in the parish of
Kinnerley.&nbsp; The entire property comprises 2,429<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 9<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and produces a yearly income of
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&pound;1227.&nbsp; The hospital consists of twelve
in-hospitallers and ten out-hospitallers.&nbsp; These persons are
appointed by the trustees as vacancies occur.&nbsp; They are
required to be parishioners of St. Chad, and inhabitants of that
part of the parish called Frankwell.&nbsp; No persons are
selected except poor decayed housekeepers, and the preference has
usually been given to females.&nbsp; Each of the in-hospitallers
has a dwelling house in the hospital, consisting of a room above
and another below, with a small garden, and other
conveniences.&nbsp; The four senior of the out-hospitallers are
allowed to occupy four sets of apartments over the schools, and
they generally succeed as vacancies occur to the situation of
in-hospitallers.&nbsp; Each of the inmates receives &pound;10
10s. a year by quarterly payments, and three tons of coals, and a
sixpenny loaf every Wednesday and Saturday.&nbsp; They are also
supplied with a certain quantity of clothing.&nbsp; The
out-hospitallers receive &pound;4 per annum, and each has a like
allowance of bread and clothing.&nbsp; A clergyman of the church
of England is paid a salary of &pound;50 a year as
chaplain.&nbsp; He attends at the hospital every school day and
reads prayers to the scholars and in-hospitallers, and the first
Thursday in every month catechises the children.&nbsp; The
minister in addition to his yearly stipend receives one guinea
for preaching a sermon on the 12th of August.&nbsp; In the
schools twenty-five boys and twenty-five girls are
instructed.&nbsp; The schoolmaster receives &pound;50 a year, and
the mistress of the girls&rsquo; school &pound;42 per annum, and
each of them has an allowance of coal.&nbsp; The scholars are the
children of parishioners of St. Chad&rsquo;s, living in
Frankwell, and are appointed by the trustees.&nbsp; They are
admitted between six and nine years of age, and are allowed to
remain till they are fourteen.&nbsp; During their stay in the
school they are completely clothed and supplied with books and
stationery; and when they are of sufficient age, the boys are
bound out to trades, and the girls placed out in service.&nbsp; A
premium of &pound;10 is allowed with each apprentice, and
&pound;5 is paid to them when they have completed their
time.&nbsp; The girls are allowed &pound;3 when going out to
service, and a like sum as a reward for good behaviour
afterwards.&nbsp; There is a good garden for the schoolmaster and
mistress, and a plot of garden ground for each of the twelve
hospitallers, which they generally let for their own benefit,
being worth about &pound;2 per annum.</p>
<p><i>St. Chad&rsquo;s Almshouses</i>, situated on the east side
of old St. Chad&rsquo;s church yard, consist of eleven miserable
tenements, containing one room each.&nbsp; They are extremely
dilapidated, there being no fund for keeping them in
repair.&nbsp; It is stated that they were founded in 1409, by one
Bennet Tupton, a common brewer, and that there were formerly
thirteen tenements, but that two fell down.&nbsp; They were
endowed in 1640, by David Ireland, with a rent charge of &pound;4
per annum, issuing out of land in Lythwood, and a further rent
charge of &pound;3. 18s., the gift of the widow of Mr. Ireland,
which is also payable out of land in the same place.&nbsp; There
is also a yearly sum of &pound;1 6s., payable out of a piece of
land in Sutton Lane, left by Robert Owen, and a small payment of
2s. 2d. yearly, made by the Mercers&rsquo; company.&nbsp; These
several sums amounting in the whole to &pound;9. 6s. 2d. are
distributed in equal proportions among the inmates.&nbsp; The
Rev. Richard Scott, B.D., bequeathed &pound;150 in 1848, and
directed the interest to be expended in coals for the poor of St.
Chad&rsquo;s almshouses.</p>
<p><i>Richard Lleweylln</i>, who was bailiff of Shrewsbury in
1637, devised certain lands in the township of Shelton, and
directed the yearly income to be employed in binding out poor
children apprentices born in the parish of St. Chad; the children
of his kindred to be preferred.&nbsp; The property left by the
testator produces an income of about &pound;12. 12s. per
annum.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Owen</i>, one of the justices of the court of common
pleas in 1598, devised to the bailiffs and commonalty of the town
of Salop the yearly rent of his farm at Calcott, and directed
that they should employ the profits thereof in giving assistance
to poor decayed householders of the parish of St. Chad.&nbsp;
This gift in after times merged into a rent charge of &pound;20
per annum.&nbsp; The amount is now received by the chamberlain of
the corporation, and distributed with the produce of the
following charity.</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span><i>Edward Owen</i>, by will, dated 25th November, 1612,
gave to the bailiff and burgesses of the town of Salop a rent
charge of &pound;10 per annum, issuing out of his lands in
Kilgurgan, in the county of Montgomery, the same to be
distributed among 200 of the poorest holders in the parish of St.
Chad, wherein he was born.&nbsp; This sum of &pound;10 is carried
to one account with that of &pound;20 derived from Thomas
Owen&rsquo;s charity, and &pound;1 10s. from the gift of David
Lloyd ap Rogers, and distributed on the first Thursday in the
year to poor persons in the parish of St. Chad.</p>

St. Chad, for the benefit of the poor.&nbsp; This gift is
distributed by the churchwardens among twenty poor widows.</p>
<p><i>Hester Farmer</i>, by will, 1691, devised a parcel of land
in Castle Foregate, and directed the rents to be paid
successively to the several parishes of St. Chad, Guilsfield,
Kinnerley, and Great Ness.&nbsp; The land produces &pound;23 per
annum, and once in four years the amount is distributed in small
sums among the poor of St. Chad&rsquo;s parish.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Williams</i>, in 1712, charged certain lands at
Llansianfraid, in the county of Montgomery, with the payment of
40s, yearly, to the minister of St. Chad, upon trust, to dispose

gowns for three poor women.</p>
<p><i>Francis Swift</i>, in 1717, bequeathed &pound;100 to the
churchwardens and overseers of the parish.&nbsp; This gift was
laid out in the purchase of three tenements, in Shrewsbury, for a
workhouse; together with &pound;100 arising from the charity of
Gabriel Rogers; &pound;10 the charity of John Lloyd; &pound;10
given for a distribution of bread, and &pound;100 given to the
parish officers for the general benefit of the inhabitants.&nbsp;
This workhouse was sold about the year 1799, and out of the sale
&pound;220, the amount of the several sums given for charitable
uses, with the further sum of &pound;40, the gift of John Lloyd,
was lent on the security of the Shrewsbury House of Industry,
bearing interest at five per cent.&nbsp; In respect of
Swift&rsquo;s gift, &pound;5 is given among poor persons in sums
varying from 2s. 6d. to 5s. each.</p>
<p><i>Martha and Mary Harwood&rsquo;s Charities</i>.&mdash;There
is an annual sum of upwards of &pound;80 arising from an estate,
at Faxley, and a dwelling house situated in Belmont, Shrewsbury,
which is distributed among poor decayed housekeepers and aged
widows, chiefly parishioners of St. Chad, excepting &pound;5 per
annum which is used as a clothing fund for poor widows.&nbsp;
There were two houses in Belmont, devised by Mary Harwood in
1734; but they were subsequently converted into one.</p>
<p><i>Josena Pemberton</i>, by a codicil to her will, dated 10th
December, 1817, desired that her sister would pay yearly during
her life the sum of five guineas, to be laid out in coals for the
poor; and she further desired that her nephew, Rev. Robert N.
Pemberton, would, within one month of her sister&rsquo;s decease,
lay out the sum of &pound;100 in the names of the trustees, or
some other safe security, and apply the annual income in
purchasing coals for poor needy persons of the parish of St.
Chad.&nbsp; When the Charity Commissioners published their
report, Miss Pemberton and her nephew were both living, and the
annual sum of &pound;5. 5s. was paid to the churchwardens.</p>
<p><i>Easter Jones</i>, in 1823, bequeathed to the minister and
churchwardens of the parish of St. Chad &pound;400 three per cent
consols, in trust, to distribute the yearly dividends every
Easter Monday, in proportions of 10s. each, to twenty-four poor
women of the said parish.</p>
<p><i>Mary Jukes</i>, by will, in 1700, devised certain premises
on Claremont Hill, and directed the yearly income to be
appropriated to charitable uses.&nbsp; The property consists of
four <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>houses, producing a yearly rental of &pound;46; out of
which 10s. is paid to the vicar for an annual sermon, one moiety
paid in apprentice fees, and the residue distributed among the
poor.</p>
<p><i>Edward Tomkis</i>, by will bearing date 24th January, 1771,
bequeathed &pound;400 upon trust, that the interest should be
annually spent in buying twelve blue coats for men, and twelve
gowns and petticoats of the same colour for an equal number of
women.&nbsp; In respect of this Charity, there is a sum of
&pound;717. 10s. three per cent. consols, the dividends of which
amount to &pound;21. 10s. 6d.&nbsp; The amount is expended in

given to the Vicar of Meole Brace for clothing poor boys,
belonging to St. Chad&rsquo;s, but resident in Meole Brace.</p>
<p><i>Hopton Estate Charity</i>.&mdash;The following legacies

1640, viz.:&mdash;Sarah Giles, &pound;50; John Hill, &pound;50;
Henry Swinnerton, &pound;50; Stephen Rogers, &pound;50; Thomas
Phillips, &pound;10; John Cotton, &pound;50; Hester Lloyd,
&pound;100; Thomas Cotton, &pound;10; John Hall, &pound;20;
Richard Lloyd, &pound;10.&nbsp; These several sums may have
formed the purchase money of the Hopton estate, as it is stated
it was purchased with the proper money of the poor of the parish
of St. Chad; but it does not state the source from whence the
money was obtained.&nbsp; The estate consists of 83<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 37<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, with farm house and
out-buildings, the whole of which was let on lease in 1748, for
99 years, at a yearly rental of &pound;15.&nbsp; The farm is
valued at upwards of &pound;100 a-year.&nbsp; Of the rent one

the Astley estate in 1804, which is secured on the Shrewsbury
House of Industry, and for which interest is paid at the rate of
five per cent.&nbsp; Out of the rents and interest above
mentioned, being &pound;113 per annum, there is paid &pound;20 to
the chapelwardens of Astley; &pound;3 for the repairs of the
chapel; &pound;3. 9s. 5d. for land tax and chief rent; &pound;2

Richard Mather, &pound;20; John Dodd, &pound;20, for a
distribution of bread&mdash;and a further sum of &pound;10, given
by an unknown donor, with the above is carried to the general
charity account.&nbsp; There is also a sum of &pound;200 secured
on the Church of St. Chad, which was lent from an accumulation of
charity money.&nbsp; The surplus of the produce of the several
charities before mentioned, not specifically applied, is carried
to one general account, and disposed of chiefly in bread.&nbsp;
There is also, occasionally, a sum of money distributed by the
churchwardens.</p>
<p><i>Nathaniel Tench</i>, in 1674, conveyed the lands and tithes
of the farm and grange of Crow Meole, in trust, to pay the yearly
proceeds to the minister of St. Chad&rsquo;s, on condition that
he preached an anniversary sermon on the 6th of June, yearly,
being the birth-day of the said N. Tench; and in case the
minister should refuse or neglect to preach the said sermon, or
should not reside, or not personally officiate in the said
parish, then the rents and profits thereof should be distributed
among the poor of St. Chad&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; The value is
about &pound;160 per annum.</p>

Atkins, &pound;20; Thomas Clemson, &pound;10; Elizabeth Forster,
&pound;30; Mary Bowdewin, &pound;20; and Mrs. Pigott,
&pound;20.&nbsp; Up to the year 1747, the interest of the several
benefactions above mentioned was paid out of the
churchwardens&rsquo; account.&nbsp; Subsequent to the year 1747,
a considerable sum was for many years disposed of annually in
bread, but it does not appear from what benefactions such bread
was provided; and from this period there is no distinct trace of
the several gifts above mentioned.&nbsp; Mary Pelton left
&pound;2. 10s., yearly, and Hester Lloyd bequeathed &pound;100;
it appears that formerly apprentice fees were paid from the
interest of this money, the last was in the year 1755.&nbsp;
There is now no evidence to shew how the capital has been
appropriated.</p>
<p><i>John Evans</i>, in 1844, bequeathed &pound;150, in trust,
to the minister and churchwardens of St. Chad&rsquo;s, and

for the necessitous poor of the parish.</p>
<h3>PARISH OF HOLY CROSS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">St. Giles&rsquo; Hospital</span>, situated near St.
Giles&rsquo; Church, was originally established for the reception
of persons afflicted with leprosy.&nbsp; Henry II., for the
support of the hospitallers, granted 30s. yearly out of the rent
of the county of Salop, and a handful of two hands of every sack
of corn, and a handful of one hand of every sack of flour exposed
for sale in Shrewsbury market.&nbsp; Henry III., in 1232, gave a
horse load of wood, daily, from his wood of Lythwood.&nbsp; The
right of nominating the inmates of the hospital is exercised by
the Earl of Tankerville, and the following payments are made to
them by one of his lordship&rsquo;s agents:&mdash;To each of the
four inmates, 1s. 6d. per week; 3s. at midsummer for coals; and
12s. 6d. at Christmas for a garment</p>
<p><i>Peter Langley</i>, in 1650, gave &pound;200 for charitable
uses, and <i>John</i> and <i>Jonathan Langley</i> bequeathed
&pound;100 for the same purpose.&nbsp; These gifts were laid out
in the purchase of lands and premises in Castle Foregate, which
produced an income of &pound;82 per annum at the time the Charity
Commissioners published their report.&nbsp; The amount is
distributed in sums, varying from 2s. to 10s., among the most
aged and needy parishioners.</p>
<p><i>Mathusalem Jones</i> charged an estate at Underdale with
the payment of so much money, as should furnish five coats for
men and five garments for women, to be given to ten paupers every
5th of November.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Prynce</i>, in 1711, bequeathed &pound;100, and
directed the same to be laid out in lands or hereditaments, the
yearly produce thereof to be distributed among the poorest
inhabitants of the parish.&nbsp; There are no deeds in the parish
relating to the laying out of this bequest; but the property
supposed to have been purchased therewith consists of four
cottages in the Abbey Foregate, producing a yearly rental of
&pound;4. 10s. each.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Doughty</i> bequeathed &pound;50, the interest
thereof to be laid out in bread.&nbsp; This bequest, and five
others, amounting in the whole to &pound;85, were probably
carried to the church account, as the interest, &pound;3. 18s.,
has been considered as a charge upon the estate held by the
parish.&nbsp; The amount is expended in bread, which is given
away every Sunday.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Jenkins</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, in 1730, directed that six
poor people, parishioners of Holy Cross, should be clothed once
in every year.&nbsp; Three poor men and three poor women are
supplied with coats and gowns at the expense of R. Jenkins, Esq.,
of Bicton.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Talbot Gorsuch</i>, by a codicil to his will,
bearing date 4th June, 1819, gave to the vicar and churchwardens
of the parish of Holy Cross and St. Giles, &pound;300 three per
cent. reduced annuities, upon trust, to distribute the interest
to such poor persons of the said parish as should be most regular
in attendance at divine service in the parish there, and be the
most deserving objects of charity.&nbsp; Not less than ten
shillings to be given to each poor person.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>There
is an entry in the old churchwardens&rsquo; book, under the date
of 1634, reciting that divers lands and messuages had been
formerly given to the repair of the churches of Holy Cross and
St. Giles, and so decreed by commission of charitable uses, James
II.&nbsp; The amount of these rents, &pound;127. 4s. 10d., with
such payments as are received for opening graves and for pew
rents, the two latter amounting to about &pound;20 per annum,
supply the place of a church rate, and are sufficient for the
repairs and ornaments of the two churches in this parish.</p>
<h3>ST. MARY&rsquo;S PARISH.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">St. Mary&rsquo;s Almshouses</span> were founded by
the Company of Drapers, at a very early period, and are usually
called the Drapers&rsquo; Almshouses.&nbsp; They appear to have
been remodelled in 1461, during the wardenship of Degory Watur, a
draper of Shrewsbury, who devoted a portion of his substance
towards their endowment.&nbsp; This beneficent man is said to
have &ldquo;dwellyd in the almeshouse hall amongst the
poor,&rdquo; and when deprived of sight, and bowed with the
weight of ninety-six years, he daily accompanied the
participators of his bounty to the &ldquo;church of our
lady,&rdquo; where he &ldquo;wold kneele amongst them in a fayre
longe pewe made for them and hym selfe.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his will,
dated 28th July, 1477, he devised certain lands to the wardens of
the Drapers&rsquo; Company, to &ldquo;sufficientlie susteyne
poore people in St. Mary Allmeshouse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other
charitable individuals have made subsequent additions to the
endowment, which are under the management of the Drapers&rsquo;
Company.&nbsp; The old almshouses stood on the west side of St.
Mary&rsquo;s church-yard, and having become much dilapidated,
were taken down in 1825, when the stun of &pound;476. 16s. was
awarded to the Company of Drapers, as a compensation for the site
and materials for the purpose of improving the town.&nbsp; The
company then purchased a piece of ground on the opposite side of
the street, for &pound;750, and they have since built sixteen
tenements, at an expense of about &pound;2,000.&nbsp; The inmates
receive about &pound;6 per annum, and are appointed by the
Drapers&rsquo; Company from amongst the poor parishioners of St.
Mary&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Lord</i>, in 1696, bequeathed &pound;100, and
directed the profits to be employed in clothing ten poor
persons.&nbsp; This sum is in the hands of the corporation, and
&pound;5 annually is paid as the interest thereof, which is laid
out in warm clothing for poor women.</p>
<p><i>Sarah Bolles</i>, in 1747, bequeathed &pound;100, the
yearly income to be given to eight poor housekeepers.&nbsp; On
account of this charity there is &pound;132. 0s. 2d. new four per
cents. standing in the names of certain trustees, who receive the
dividends, amounting to &pound;5. 5s. 6d.</p>
<p><i>Ann Parry</i>, in 1755, gave &pound;60, being a benefaction
intended by her sister, Mary Tench, deceased, the interest to be
given to eight poor housekeepers, not burthensome to the parish;
and in 1776 bequeathed &pound;20, the interest to be given
annually to four poor widows.&nbsp; These two sums were laid out
in the year 1790 in pewing the church, and since that period
&pound;4 has been annually paid out of the church rate.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Price</i>, in 1780, bequeathed &pound;50, the
interest to be given in bread to the poor of the parish.&nbsp;
This money is lent to the guardians of the house of industry.</p>
<p><i>Edward Lloyd</i>, in 1789, left &pound;190, the interest to
be given to ten poor housekeepers.&nbsp; This sum is secured by a
bond given in pursuance of an act of parliament passed for the
rebuilding of the church of St. Chads, and &pound;4 10s. is paid
annually as the interest thereof.</p>
<p><i>Richard Lister</i>, in 1793, bequeathed &pound;100, and
directed the interest to be laid out in bread and given to the
poor after divine service every Sunday morning.&nbsp; In respect
of this gift there is the sum of &pound;154 14s. 10d. three per
cent consols, producing annually dividends to the amount of
&pound;4. 12s. 8d.</p>
<p><i>Pemberton&rsquo;s Charity</i>.&nbsp; The particulars of
this charity will be found amongst those for the parish of St.
Alkmund.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;2. 2s. is expended annually in
coal, and distributed amongst poor housekeepers.</p>
<p><i>Lost Charities</i>.&nbsp; In the parliamentary returns of
1786 there is mentioned a legacy left by Madam Honor Dryden, and
several others, amounting in the whole to &pound;180.&nbsp; This
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>sum was in
the hands of a person who became insolvent, and only &pound;19
9s. was received from his estate.&nbsp; Nothing is now known even
of this sum.</p>
<h3>PARISH OF ST. JULIAN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Thomas
Bowdler</i>, in 1733, bequeathed &pound;100, to be placed out at
interest, the profit to be given away in twopenny loaves every
Lord&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; He also gave his executors the sum of
&pound;1000 upon trust, to lay out such part thereof as they
should think fit, in purchasing or building a school-house and
residence for the teachers, and the residue to be invested in
land, the yearly profits thereof to be applied in maintaining a
master and mistress to teach poor children born in the parish of
St. Julian, and in clothing them and putting some of them out
apprentices, or such useful occupation as the trustees should
think proper.&nbsp; The property now vested in the trustees
consists of an estate at Treffnant and Llanercrockwell, in the
parish of Guilsfield, consisting of 168<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 22<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, with suitable house and
outbuildings, producing a rental of &pound;150 per annum.&nbsp;
On the enclosure of commons in 1788 an allotment was made to the
trustees, which was conveyed to Thomas Loxdale, Esq., for a term
of 500 years, in consideration of which Mr. Loxdale paid the sum
of &pound;200 to the trustees; this amount was subsequently
employed in the reparations of farm buildings, and other
improvements on the school estate.&nbsp; The school is situated
in Beeche&rsquo;s lane, and twenty-five boys and an equal number
of girls are clothed and educated from the funds of the
charity.</p>
<p><i>Catherine Smith</i>, in 1621, left a rent charge of
&pound;4 per annum, to be distributed among four poor widows of
this parish.&nbsp; The amount is paid from the property of the
corporation, and they appoint the poor widows.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Davies</i>, in 1668, directed his trustees to raise
the sum of &pound;300, and dispose of the same in the purchase of
a rent charge, to be disposed of as follows:&mdash;40s. to the
minister of the parish for preaching four sermons, one on the 3rd
September and the other three sermons quarterly; 20s. yearly
among poor housekeepers; &pound;4 to eight poor widows; &pound;4
for maintaining two scholars at the university, and &pound;4 to
be paid in apprentice fees.&nbsp; In 1689 a rent charge of
&pound;12. 5s. was purchased with &pound;250, but it does not
appear how the remaining &pound;50 was disposed of.&nbsp; The
estate is situate at Sutton, from which the rent charge issues,
and was the property of the late John Hiles.</p>
<p><i>Richard Williams</i>, in 1576, left &pound;50, and directed
the interest to be distributed among poor householders of this
parish on Christmas day.&nbsp; He also bequeathed the residue of
his personal estate, after payment of his debts and legacies to
the executors, to be held in trust, and to dispose of the yearly
income in clothing poor men or women or in putting out
apprentices.&nbsp; It appears that the produce of the
testator&rsquo;s residuary estate amounted to &pound;266. 18s.,
and that &pound;6. 18s. was distributed to the poor, and
&pound;260 was placed out at interest secured on bond given by
the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">General Charities</span>.&mdash;The sum of
&pound;308 17s. was expended in the purchase of an estate at
Ellesmere, in 1726, which consists of 19<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 22<span
class="smcap">p</span>., producing a yearly rental of
&pound;45.&nbsp; Of the said purchase money &pound;200 was the
gift of Thomas Baker, in 1685; &pound;30 the gift of Thomas
Cotton, in 1683; &pound;50 the bequest of Stephen Rogers; and
&pound;20 the gift of Richard Presland.&nbsp; The rent is
received by the churchwardens, and carried to one account with
the produce of several other charities, and disposed of in bread,
and small sums of money, to deserving objects of charity.</p>
<p>The sum of &pound;1. 6s. is received every alternate year from
a farm in Willstone, which was bought subject to this payment,
about forty years ago.&nbsp; This is known by the name of
<i>Diana Robert&rsquo;s Charity</i>, the like payment being made
every alternate year to the parish of Cardington.</p>
<p><i>Brook&rsquo;s Charity</i>.&nbsp; The particulars of this
charity will he found noticed with those of St. Alkmund.&nbsp;
The yearly sum of &pound;2. 10s. is received on account of this
parish, and carried to the general charity account noticed
above.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span><i>The
Rev. Samuel Presland</i>, by will, in 1750, as appears from an
entry in the book of charities, gave &pound;10 to be placed out
by the overseers, and the interest to be distributed to the
poor.&nbsp; In the same book it is stated that <i>Thomas
Presland</i> gave &pound;20, and directed the interest to be
given among poor housekeepers.&nbsp; These two sums, with
&pound;50, the legacy of Richard Williams, are placed out on the
security of the house of industry, and the interest carried to
the general charity account.</p>
<p><i>Mary Griffith</i>, in 1781, left &pound;50 to the
churchwardens and overseers, the interest to be distributed every
Sunday in twopenny loaves.&nbsp; This sum is placed out on the
security of the tolls of the Leighton turnpike road, and
&pound;2. 10s. annually received as the interest thereof.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Philemon Hayes</i> left to the minister of the
parish 10s. for a lecture on Candlemas day, and the same sum to
be distributed to poor people by the churchwardens.&nbsp; John
Bryan by his will made an addition to Mr. Hayes&rsquo;s gift of
10s. for the said sermon and 10s. to the poor.&nbsp; In respect
of these charities the sum of &pound;2 is charged upon land
called the Tenter Field, near the Quarry, Shrewsbury.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Hanmer</i>, in 1755, left &pound;20, the interest
to be distributed in bread; she also left a house on the stone
bridge, the rent to be paid to the clerk of the parish.&nbsp; The
stone bridge above-mentioned with the house thereon has since
been taken down, and a sum of money was awarded to the clerk as
compensation for it, with which sum, and the &pound;20 left to be
distributed in bread, another house was bought for him.&nbsp; The
house is now let by the clerk, and he receives the rent and pays
thereout 20s. yearly, as the interest of the legacy of
&pound;20.</p>
<p><i>Richard Breathen</i> gave to the churchwardens and
overseers the sum of &pound;20, the interest to be given to the
poor.&nbsp; This money was placed in the hands of a person who
died insolvent, and after a lapse of some years his son repaid
the principal, and in 1820 it was carried to the general charity
account.</p>
<p><i>Josina Pemberton</i>.&nbsp; The particulars of this charity
will be found noticed with the charities of St. Alkmund
parish.&nbsp; The yearly sum of &pound;2. 2s. is divided among
thirty poor housekeepers.</p>
<p>The average annual income of the Charities of Shrewsbury
amounts to about &pound;2,000, exclusive of the Loan Charities,
which produce no income, being gifts of sums of money to be lent
out for limited periods to young tradesmen and others, free of
interest.&nbsp; The Loan Charities amount to &pound;840. 8s.
4d.&nbsp; In 1837 the High Court of Chancery appointed certain
trustees to administer the charities of which the Corporations of
Shrewsbury were previously the trustees.&nbsp; The following is a
list of the trustees:&mdash;The Right Hon. Lord Berwick, Sir F.
Brian Hill, John Bather, Esq., Mr. R. Beacall, Peter Beck, Esq.,
Robert Burton, Esq., W. J. Clement, Esq., T. G. Gwyn, Esq., J.

<p>The liberties of Shrewsbury were abolished by the municipal
boundary act, and now form part of the county of Salop.&nbsp; The
several parishes which they comprised are now returned in the
Albrighton Division, in the Wem Division of North Bradford
Hundred in the Condover Division, Condover Hundred, and in the
Ford and Pontesbury Divisions, of Ford Hundred.&nbsp; The
following are places included within the liberties of the
borough, the residents of which are included in the Shrewsbury
Directory:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alkmund St</span>.&mdash;A parish partly
returned in the Albrighton Division, and partly in Ford Division
of the Ford Hundred.&nbsp; The parish, in 1841, contained 303
houses and 1641 inhabitants, of whom 1396 were included within
the parliamentary borough.&nbsp; The rateable value of the parish
is &pound;9,041. 11s.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span><span
class="smcap">Chad St</span>.&mdash;The parish of St. Chads is
partly returned in the Albrighton Division, partly in Condover
Hundred, and partly in the Ford Division, of the Ford
Hundred.&nbsp; The entire parish, in 1841, contained 7625
inhabitants, of whom 4524 persons resided within the boundaries
of the borough, exclusive of those residing in Frankwell.&nbsp;
There were also 912 inhabited houses, 80 uninhabited, and 4
houses building.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Frankwell</span> is a populous township in
St. Chad&rsquo;s parish, forming a suburb on the north-west side
of Shrewsbury, from which it is approached by the Welsh
bridge.&nbsp; In 1841 it was returned as containing 413 inhabited
houses, 37 uninhabited and 2 building, with a population of 1895
souls, of whom 902 were males and 993 females.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Holy Cross and St. Giles</span> forms the
eastern suburb to the town of Shrewsbury, and contains the
township of Abbey Foregate and part of Coleham.&nbsp; Abbey
Foregate stretches from the English bridge to Lord Hill&rsquo;s
column, upwards of a mile in length; the street is wide and for
some distance planted on each side with trees; it contains many
genteel residences, and is by far the handsomest approach to the
town.&nbsp; In 1841 the township was returned as containing 358
inhabited houses, 22 uninhabited, and 14 building, and 1638
inhabitants&mdash;of whom 701 were males and 937 females.&nbsp;
That part of Coleham, returned as in the parish of Holy Cross and
St. Giles, contained 30 houses and 104 souls.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Julian&rsquo;s</span> parish is partly
in the Condover Hundred and partly in the Ford Division of the
Ford Hundred.&nbsp; The entire parish, in 1841, contained 3252
inhabitants, of whom 2902 were in the limits of the borough of
Shrewsbury, of the latter number 986 persons were resident in
Coleham.&nbsp; In 1841 there were 387 inhabited houses and 22
uninhabited.&nbsp; Rateable value of the parish
&pound;12,890.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Coleham</span> is a township, partly in
St. Julian&rsquo;s parish and partly in that of Holy Cross and
St. Giles; in 1840 there were 332 houses and 1090 souls&mdash;of
whom 986 were in the parish of St. Julian and 104 in the parish
of Holy Cross and St. Giles.&nbsp; Coleham lies on the south bank
of the river Severn and forms the southern suburb to the town of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Here the manufacture of cotton goods was
formerly carried on to some extent; the factories are now
unoccupied.&nbsp; The houses are for the most part small, and
occupied as cottage residences.&nbsp; A neat church has been
built here which is noticed at a preceding page.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Mary&rsquo;s</span> parish is partly
in the Albrighton Division, and, in 1841, contained a population
of 6684 souls&mdash;of whom 6684 were returned as in the borough
of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The return includes the Castle,
extra-parochial, containing 7 persons; 168 in the County Gaol,
186 in the County Infirmary, 94 in the Shrewsbury Free Grammar
School, and 35 persons in boats.&nbsp; At the same period there
were 1048 inhabited houses, 112 uninhabited, and 2 building.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Meol Brace</span> parish is chiefly in the
Condover Hundred, the entire parish contained, in 1841, 1195
inhabitants&mdash;of whom 361 persons were returned as in the
liberty of the borough of Shrewsbury.</p>

<h2>THE ALBRIGHTON DIVISION.</h2>
<p>The Albrighton division was formed into a separate
jurisdiction for magisterial purposes under the authority of an
Act of parliament, passed in the 4th of William IV.&nbsp; It
comprises the following places:&mdash;The parishes of
Battlefield, Broughton, Fitz, Grinshill, Preston Gubballs, and
Uffington; the chapelries of Albrighton, Astley, Clive, and
Hadnal; and the township of Acton Reynold, Albrightlee,
Harlscott, Hencott, Longner, Berwick, Leaton, Merrington, Newton
and Wollascot; and the extra-parochial liberty of
Haughmond.&nbsp; It may be necessary to observe, that the
arrangement of this work being by hundreds, the townships, or
chapelries, comprised in the several hundreds, will be found
alphabetically arranged, under the head of the respective town or
village, in which the parish church is situated.</p>
<h3>ALBRIGHTLEE,</h3>
<p>a small township in St. Mary&rsquo;s parish three miles N.N.E.
from Shrewsbury, containing 742<span class="smcap">a</span>.
2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 21<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land, is the property of Andrew William Corbet, Esq.&nbsp; At the
census of 1841 there were 8 houses and 45 inhabitants.&nbsp; The
principal residence is an antique house of timber and plaster,
occupied by Mr. John Minton, who farms a considerable portion of
the land in the township, and is also a maltster.</p>
<h3>HARLSCOTT</h3>
<p>township, situated two and a half miles N.N.E. from
Shrewsbury, is partly in St. Alkmund, and partly in that of St.
Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In 1841 there were 8 houses and 41
inhabitants returned as in the former parish, and 6 houses and 28
inhabitants in the latter.&nbsp; The land owners are Andrew
William Corbet, Esq., and Scarlett LLoyd Parry, Esq.</p>
<p>The principal residents are Thomas Briscoe Barber, farmer;
Scarlett LLoyd Parry, Esq., solicitor; John Ralphs, carpenter;
and William Hewlett, shoemaker.</p>
<h3>HENCOTT,</h3>
<p>a small township with a scattered population, is about one and
three quarter miles N. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Colonel Wingfield
is the only proprietor in this township, which in 1841 had 14
scattered houses and a population of 84 souls.&nbsp; The
Shrewsbury and Chester railway intersects this township.&nbsp;
The soil for the most part is a fertile loam.</p>
<p>The following are the principal farmers, viz.:&mdash;Robert
Legh, Cross Hall; Ann Bromley, Hencott farm, Robert Parry,
manager; Edward Randles, Old Heath; and Joseph Yates, Old
Heath.</p>
<h3><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>BATTLEFIELD</h3>
<p>is a small parish, pleasantly situated three and a quarter
miles N.N.E. from Shrewsbury, which contains 1,008<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, the whole of which is the
property of Andrew William Corbet, Esq., of Sundorne
Castle.&nbsp; In 1801 there was a population of 83 souls; in
1831, 70; and in 1841 there were 14 houses and 64
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;1,008. 6s. 8d.&nbsp;
The name is derived from the battle fought here on the 21st of
July, 1403, between Henry IV. and the forces under Percy, Earl of
Northumberland, and generally denominated the battle of
Shrewsbury, which will be found noticed in a preceding
page.&nbsp; The king afterwards built a collegiate church for
secular canons, upon the spot where the battle was fought, and
&ldquo;endowed it with a piece of ground, with all the buildings
on it, within the lordship of Albrighton Husee, in the field
called Battlefield, which piece of ground was ditched in, and
contained in length and breadth two acres of land, together with
two inlets and outlets along the lands of Richard Husee, one
twenty feet wide and the other fifteen feet wide.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
doubt appropriate buildings for the residence of the canons and
servants of the establishment were erected on the land inside
this ditch: these probably were demolished at the period of the
dissolution of monasteries, but no remains of them are now to be
seen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, a venerable fabric
dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, consists of nave, chancel, and
embattled tower ornamented with pinnacles; the nave, however, has
long been roofless, the windows are destroyed, and the tower is
in a dilapidated state.&nbsp; Divine worship is now performed in
the chancel, which has been neatly fitted up, and a new font
recently added.&nbsp; The fine east window was formerly richly
adorned with stained glass.&nbsp; In a recess on the south side
of the altar is a mutilated carving of the Virgin Mary, with a
small figure of the dead Saviour on her lap.&nbsp; A beautiful
monument of the white Grinshill freestone, enriched with Gothic
tracery, remembers John Corbet, Esq., Emma Elizabeth, his wife,
and John Kynaston Corbet, their son.&nbsp; About half a century
ago, when the vault was made in which rest the remains of Mr.
Corbet, the workmen discovered an ancient stirrup and bridle bit,
which had lain among the ashes of the slain since the period of
the battle which gave origin to the church.&nbsp; Near the

Esq., of Longner hall, is owner of the whole township, which in
1841 is returned as containing four houses and 13

with projecting gables ornamented with turrets and pinnacles, and
fronted with the beautiful white Grinshill free stone; it stands
on an acclivity commanding a rich view of the surrounding
country, and of the Severn, which rolls immediately beneath
it.&nbsp; The views up and down the river and over the adjoining
highly cultivated and well wooded country are peculiarly
picturesque and beautiful, affording a great variety of landscape
scenery.&nbsp; An extensive and finely timbered park surrounds
the hall, the immediate vicinity of which is tastefully
ornamented with pleasure grounds and shrubberies.&nbsp; The
interior of the mansion is elegantly furnished, and contains some
beautiful paintings; a fine portrait of Queen Elizabeth is
supposed to have been presented by her Majesty to the ancestors
of the present proprietor.&nbsp; A magnificent gothic window of
stained glass ornamented with figures of different members of the

<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>In
the garden is a tomb placed over the body of Edward Burton, Esq.,
a zealous protestant in Queen Mary&rsquo;s days, and is by Fox,
in his Acts and Monuments, named among those who by various means
escaped persecution.&nbsp; He one day sitting in his parlour
alone, meditating on the troubles of the times, and the
deliverances he and others had found; and whilst thus reflecting
heard a general ring of bells in Shrewsbury, which he concluded
must be for the accession of the Lady Elizabeth to the
throne.&nbsp; Anxious to know the truth, and not daring to send
any of his servants to inquire, he sent his eldest son&mdash;a
youth about sixteen years of age, ordering him if the bells rang
for the Lady Elizabeth&rsquo;s accession to throw his hat up into
the air on his arrival at a certain place where he could he seen
from the hall.&nbsp; The young man finding it as was expected,
threw up his hat, which his father seeing, was suddenly affected
with a transport of joy, that he with difficulty reached a chair,
and immediately expired.&nbsp; By his will he ordered that his
body should be buried in the parish church of St. Chad, in
Shrewsbury, and that no mass monger should be present at his
interment.&nbsp; His friends designing to execute his will in
this respect, brought his corpse to the church, and were there
met by the curate, who said that &ldquo;Mr. Burton was an heretic
and should not be buried in his church.&rdquo;&nbsp; His friends
were therefore obliged to carry his body back again, and bury it
in his own garden.&nbsp; A monument was set over him, which,
being injured and defaced with the weather, Edward Burton, Esq.,
his grandson, in the year 1614, re-edified the tomb.&nbsp; The
following is the epitaph placed on the tomb, written by Sir
Andrew Corbet, Bart.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Was&rsquo;t for denying Christ, or some
notorious fact,<br />
That this man&rsquo;s body Christian burial lack&rsquo;d?<br />
Oh no! his faithful true profession,<br />
Was the chief cause, which was then held transgression;<br />
When popery here did reign, the See of Rome,<br />
Would not admit to any such a tomb,<br />
Within their idol temple walls; but he<br />
Truly professing Christianity,<br />
Was like Christ Jesus in a garden laid,<br />
Where he shall rest in peace till it be said&mdash;<br />
Come faithful servant, come, receive with me,<br />
A just reward for thy integrity.&rdquo;&mdash;1614.</p>

26<span class="smcap">p</span>., and is the property of Andrew
William Corbet, Esq.&nbsp; The stately pile of <span
class="smcap">Haughmond Abbey</span> is now fallen into almost
total decay, but the magnificent ruins have an imposing
appearance; they stand on rising ground, backed by woods, and
command an extended view the plain of Shrewsbury, its town, and
castle, and the fine <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>demesne of Sundorne.&nbsp; From the
extent of the ruins it must have been a place of great
magnitude.&nbsp; Of the Abbey Church few remains exist: the south
door of the nave, which opened into the cloister, exhibits an
elegant specimen of Anglo-Norman architecture.&nbsp; The outer
walls of the chapter house are in a perfect state of
preservation.&nbsp; The entrance is by a finely ornamented round
arch, with a window on each side, divided into small
lights.&nbsp; Southward of the chapter house are the remains of
the refectory, and beyond it the shell of a noble hall, measuring
eighty-one feet by thirty-six feet.&nbsp; The windows were
formerly filled with Gothic tracery.&nbsp; The ruins of the
cloister and abbots&rsquo; lodging may also still be
traced.&nbsp; The monastery was founded in the year 1110, by
William Fitz Alan, for canons of the order of St.
Augustine.&nbsp; It was richly endowed with lands by the founder,
and other individuals, and had many valuable privileges and
immunities granted by the Popes Honorus III., Nicholas III.,
Boniface IX., and Martin IV.&nbsp; The yearly revenues of the
abbey at the dissolution were &pound;269. 13s. 7d., according to
Dugdale, and &pound;294. 13s. 9d. according to Speed.&nbsp;
Leland says, &ldquo;There were an hermitage and chapel on this
spot before the abbey was built.&rdquo;&nbsp; William Fitz Alan
and other members of the family were buried here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sundorne Castle</span>, a spacious and
splendid Gothic mansion, adorned with battlements and turrets, is
situated on a beautiful lawn, amidst the rich verdure of the
adjoining grounds, which are pleasingly diversified with
shrubberies and pleasant walks, and ornamented with a fine sheet
of water, covering upwards of sixty acres.&nbsp; The interior of
the mansion is superbly furnished.&nbsp; The chairs in the
drawing room are of ebony, most elaborately carved.&nbsp; It also
contains a remarkably fine antique statue of Venus.&nbsp; There
are some exquisite paintings by Titian, Salvator Rosa, Rembrandt,
Guido, Raphael, Rubens, Wouvermans, and Van Huysum, among which
is the original design for the altar-piece at Antwerp, by Rubens,
and the Holy Family, exquisitely executed by Raphael.&nbsp; The
library contains a valuable and extensive collection of rare
books, and the windows are ornamented with stained glass.&nbsp;
Amongst a collection of antiquities is the chapter roll of
Haughmond Abbey, and the seal of the abbot: the latter was found
about thirty years ago, near the ruins of the abbey.&nbsp; A
beautiful sequestered carriage drive, of five miles in length,
leads through the woods of the Sundorne demesne.&nbsp; The
kitchen gardens and vineries are situated at the back of the
castle, and cover an extent of about four acres.&nbsp; The
Corbets of Lee removed to Albright Hussey in the reign of Charles
I., and to Sundorne Castle in the middle of the last century.</p>

Chapel</span>, a neat stone fabric in the Gothic style, was
repaired and beautified in 1837, when a new tower was added at
the west end.&nbsp; The entrance, formerly on the south side,
exhibits the Saxon style of architecture.&nbsp; In the interior
is a neat marble tablet, in memory of the Minor family, of Astley
House.&nbsp; A new font was added at the time the tower was
built.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, returned at
&pound;56, in the patronage of the corporation of Shrewsbury, and
enjoyed by the Rev. William Vaughan.&nbsp; In the church yard are
the following lines, on a grave stone in memory of Rowland
Deakin, who died in 1751, aged 95 years:&mdash;</p>

educating poor children of this chapelry, and &pound;6 per annum
paid to the minister of Astley chapel, for reading prayers and

140</span>BERWICK,</h3>
<p>a township pleasantly situated two miles N.N.W. from
Shrewsbury; at the census of 1841 had 67 houses, and a population
of 271 souls.&nbsp; Here the country has an undulating surface,
richly clothed with timber, and presents many interesting views
of picturesque beauty.&nbsp; The estate is now the property of
the Honourable Henry Wentworth Powys.&nbsp; Berwick House is a
handsome mansion, of considerable extent, composed of brick with
stone finishings.&nbsp; It is delightfully situated in a spacious
and finely wooded park; and the immediate vicinity of the house
is richly beautified with shrubberies and pleasure grounds.&nbsp;
The iron gates, at the entrance of the park, are of the most
elaborate workmanship; they have a noble and magnificent
appearance, and are said to have cost &pound;1,000.&nbsp; Berwick
House is now the temporary residence of Thomas Hope, Esq.; and
Upper Berwick House, a neat brick structure, is the occasional
seat of the Hon. Henry Wentworth Powys.</p>
<p>A short distance from the hall are the almshouses, erected and
endowed in 1672 by <i>Sir Samuel Jones</i>.&nbsp; They consist of
sixteen tenements, and a small room for the use of the chaplain,
with gardens attached thereto, and are surrounded by a lofty
wall.&nbsp; The yearly income amounts to about &pound;183. 7s.
6d. per annum, and arises from the following sources:&mdash;Nine
acres of land in Castle Foregate, let for &pound;36 per annum;
the several sums of &pound;20, &pound;40, and &pound;80 per annum
charged on the Berwick estate; and the dividends on &pound;245.
18s. 3d.&nbsp; South Sea Annuities.&nbsp; From the sources above
mentioned, each inmate receives about &pound;5. 8s. annually,
besides clothing and coal.&nbsp; The emoluments of the chaplain
amount to about &pound;54. 9s. per annum.&nbsp; Between the
almshouses and the hall is the chapel appropriated to the use of
the inmates of the adjacent almshouses.&nbsp; It is a small
fabric, of a primitive appearance, with a tower at the west end,
and was built in 1762, on the site of a former edifice which had
become ruinous.&nbsp; There is a free school in the township,
supported by the Hon. Henry W. Powys, where forty scholars are
educated.&nbsp; Leaton Knolls, the delightful residence of John
Arthur Lloyd, Esq., is just within the bounds of this township,
situated in a picturesque glen, and surrounded with beautiful
shrubberies and thriving plantations.</p>

<h3>CLIVE</h3>
<p>is a chapelry in the parish of St. Mary, Shrewsbury, 3&frac12;
miles south from Wem, and eight miles north from
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In 1801 there was a population of 289 souls,
and in 1841 there were 61 houses and 273 inhabitants.&nbsp; The
township contains 1370 acres of land, mostly highly productive;
the soil is a mixture of sand and loam, and considered good
turnip land.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;2,546 10s.&nbsp; The
Duke of Cleveland is the principal owner and lord of the manor;
Mr. Joshua Holmes, George Harding, Esq., Mrs. Nickson, Mrs.
Griffith, and others, are also freeholders.&nbsp; The village is
pleasantly situated on high ground, and commands some pleasing
views of the romantic and rural scenery by which it is
surrounded.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a plain stone fabric,
dedicated to All Saints, and consists of nave and chancel, with a
small turret containing two bells; it is neatly pewed, and the
roof is of groined timber.&nbsp; The pulpit is of white free
stone exquisitely carved, and a new front has recently been
added.&nbsp; The windows on the south side and at the west end
were beautified, <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>and had new mullions introduced in 1849, when other
alterations and improvements were made by the incumbent.&nbsp;
The living is a perpetual curacy returned at &pound;66 in the
patronage of the corporation of Shrewsbury; incumbent, Rev.
William Jaudwine, M.A.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Independents</span> have a small chapel built in 1844; the
congregation is under the pastoral care of the Rev. David
Jones.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Clive Hall</span>, a plain
substantial stone edifice in the Elizabethan style, was built by
Daniel Wycherley, father of the poet William Wycherley; it is now
the property of George Harding, Esq.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Sansaw Hall</span>, the residence of Captain
Martin, a handsome and commodious brick residence, is
delightfully situated in park-like grounds, and surrounded by
lawns and shrubberies laid out with great taste and beauty.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Shooters&rsquo; Hill</span>, another good
house delightfully situated, is the property and residence of
Mrs. Griffiths.</p>
<p>Clive is said to have been the birth place of the poet
Wycherley, though some affirm that he was born at Wem.&nbsp;
Wycherley was one of the wits and poets of Charles II., and was
born about the year 1640.&nbsp; After receiving an education at
school, he was sent to France, where he embraced the Roman
Catholic religion.&nbsp; A little before the restoration he
returned to England, and entered as a gentleman commoner at
Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford; but, being never matriculated, he
quitted the university without a degree, and took chambers in the
middle temple.&nbsp; He soon, however, deserted the law, and
following the taste of that dissipated age, devoted himself to
the composition of comedies.&nbsp; His first piece, &ldquo;Love
in a wood, or St. James&rsquo; Park,&rdquo; made its first
appearance in 1672, and quickly brought its author into
notice.&nbsp; He was much esteemed by Villiers, the witty Duke of
Buckingham, and was honoured with the attentions of his
Majesty.&nbsp; His marriage with the Countess of Drogheda proved
an unhappy one.&nbsp; His lady was excessively jealous of him,
and though on her death a few years after, she settled her whole
estate on her husband, the title was disputed, and he became so
involved in his circumstances by law expenses and other
incumbrances, that he was thrown into prison.&nbsp; He remained
in confinement about seven years, when James II., going to see
his comedy of &ldquo;The Plain Dealer,&rdquo; was so much
delighted with it that he gave orders for the payment of the
author&rsquo;s debts, and granted him a pension of &pound;200 a
year.&nbsp; Wycherley died in 1675, at the age of 75.&nbsp; His
posthumous works in prose and verse were published in 1728.</p>

<h3>LEATON</h3>
<p>township, four and a half miles N.W. by N. from Shrewsbury, in
1841 contained 60 houses and 245 inhabitants.&nbsp; John Arthur
Lloyd, Esq., is the proprietor of the whole township, and resides
at <span class="smcap">Leaton Knolls</span>, a beautiful modern
mansion, which <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>has been erected about thirty years.&nbsp; The house
stands on the acclivity of a hill, overlooking a romantic glen,
planted with thriving plantations.&nbsp; The grounds are
beautifully diversified with shrubberies and pleasant walks; and
in no place in the county is there to be seen such a fine
collection of rare shrubs and choice forest trees as are to be
met at Leaton Knolls.&nbsp; Among the more remarkable objects is
an extensive and valuable collection of the conifera tribe, with
their curious and varied foliage.&nbsp; A short distance from the
house a large plot of ground has been enclosed with a lofty brick
wall, for a kitchen garden, which is now in course of
formation.&nbsp; The house and a portion of the pleasure grounds
stand within the bounds of Berwick township.&nbsp; There is also
a neat free school, at the cross of roads, built in 1828, by John
A. Lloyd, Esq., who also pays for the education of the children,
of whom 35 attend.&nbsp; Leaton Hall, now a good farm residence,
was built in 1683.&nbsp; The Shrewsbury and Chester railway
intersects the township, and has a station here.&nbsp; Bomere
Heath is partly in this township and partly in Preston
Gobalds.</p>

<h3>NEWTON,</h3>
<p>a small township, comprising two farms only, is the property
of the Hon. Henry Wentworth Powys, and Richard Betton, Esq., and
is situated three and a half miles N.N.W. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
At the census of 1841 there were 2 houses, and a population of 21
souls.&nbsp; The Shrewsbury and Chester railway passes through
the township.&nbsp; The farm premises of Samuel Davies, at Cross
Green, Berwick, are situated within the bounds of this
parish.</p>
<p>The resident farmers are Samuel Davies and Charles Kent.</p>
<h3>WOLLASCOTT,</h3>
<p>another small township in the parish of St. Mary&rsquo;s, is
situated four miles N.N.W. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In 1841 there
were 4 houses and 23 inhabitants.&nbsp; John Arthur Lloyd, Esq.,
and Lady Tyrwhitt are the land owners.&nbsp; The occupants of the
farms are James Teece and Richard Tonkies.</p>
<h3>HADNAL, OR HADNAL EASE,</h3>
<p>is a township and chapelry in the parish of Middle, five miles
N.N.E. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The village is pleasantly situated
on the turnpike road from Shrewsbury to Chester, and contains
some good farm houses and a commodious and respectable inn.&nbsp;
The township contains 814<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 19<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land.&nbsp; Viscount Hill is the principal land owner; besides
whom Sir Andrew V. Corbet, Mr. Charles Woodward, Mr. Joseph
Morris, Mrs. Wildig, and others, are also owners.&nbsp; The
population in 1801 was 362; and in 1841 there were 92 houses and
429 souls in the chapelry, and 221 in the township.&nbsp;
Rateable value, &pound;1,119. 16s. 8d.&nbsp; Rent charge,
&pound;107. 18s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Episcopal Chapel</span> is a neat
stone edifice, mantled with ivy; it has a square castellated
tower, ornamented with a clock, and the chapel is surrounded with
a spacious cemetery, the margin of which is fringed with
flourishing limes, yews, and fir trees, which give it a pleasing
and rural appearance.&nbsp; In the east window are several
fragments of stained glass, apparently of the date of the
erection&mdash;the sixteenth century.&nbsp; The living is a
perpetual curacy, in the patronage of the rector of Middle, and
enjoyed by the Rev. William Oliver, of Astley Lodge.&nbsp; In the
Liber Ecclesiasticus the living is returned at &pound;55.&nbsp;
The annual value, however, now is upwards of &pound;70, arising
from the sum of &pound;400, royal <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>bounty, and the moiety of the rent
of a farm in the township of Criggion, which was purchased with
money belonging to the livings of Preston Gubbals, Hanwood, and
Hadnal, by the then incumbent, who, in consequence of enjoying
several benefices, was denominated &ldquo;St. John of the Seven
Churches.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chapelry contains the townships of
Alderton, Hardwick, Haston, Shotton, and Sneethcott.&nbsp;
Rateable value of the chapelry, &pound;5,614. 17s. 9d; acres,
2,418 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 20<span
class="smcap">p</span>.&nbsp; The Banasters, a family of
considerable note in former times, had an estate and seat at
Hadnal as early as the time of William the Conqueror.&nbsp; The
hall was a spacious mansion of chequered timber work, and
occupied a site near the episcopal chapel.&nbsp; The moat may
still be traced, adjoining the turnpike road.&nbsp; Mr. Hulbert
is of opinion that Hadnal Hall was the place where the Duke of
Buckingham was betrayed by Humphrey Banaster, in 1483, from
whence he was taken to Shrewsbury, and, without trial, beheaded,
by command of Richard III.&nbsp; Thomas Banaster, of Hadnal, was
sheriff of the county in 1403.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Providence Grove</span> is a neat house,
the residence and property of Mr. Charles Hulbert, the author and
publisher of an elaborate history of the county, and numerous
other publications.&nbsp; On the 7th of January, 1839, an awfully
destructive fire occurred at Providence Grove, and so rapid was
the progress of the devouring element, that all the valuable
property, consisting of a library of more than 3,000 volumes,
manuscripts, curiosities, paintings, furniture, a large stock of
new books and engravings, with the whole of the house, and a
great portion of the houses adjoining, were consumed.&nbsp; The
loss to the proprietor was irreparable, as only the premises were
insured, and those at one half of their value.&nbsp; Mr. Hulbert
has now arrived at a good old age, and is publishing an account
of his own life, which he entitles &ldquo;Seventy Years of an
eventful Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span>, a neat
stone fabric, was built in 1832.&nbsp; The congregation is under
the pastoral care of the Rev. David James.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Free School</span> is endowed with
&pound;300, bequeathed by Dame Mary Hill, in 1787, who at the
same time made the following bequests, viz., &pound;30 towards
building a school-house in Hadnal, &pound;100 to the treasurer of
the Salop Infirmary, the interest of &pound;100 to be distributed
among poor persons residing in Hadnal, the same amount for the
benefit of the poor of Middle, and the residue of her personal
estate for such charitable purposes as she by a codicil to her
will should direct.&nbsp; The residue of the personal estate
amounted to &pound;1,305 2s. 5d., in respect of which &pound;30
per annum is paid to a dissenting minister at Hadnal, &pound;14
towards the support of the school, and &pound;10 to Prees
school.&nbsp; These several sums appear to be the interest of
&pound;1,200, at 4&frac12; per cent.; it is stated the balance,
&pound;105. 2s. 5d. was applied in building the school at
Weston.&nbsp; In respect of the &pound;300 bequeathed to Hadnal
school, &pound;12 per annum as the interest thereof is paid to
the teacher.&nbsp; It does not appear that any new trustees have
been appointed for carrying into effect the trusts declared in
the will of Dame Mary Hill.&nbsp; The management has therefore
continued in that family.</p>
<p>It is stated in the parliamentary returns of 1786, that Mr.
Watkins gave &pound;15 for the use of the poor of Hadnal.&nbsp;
About thirty years ago Sir Andrew Corbet gave &pound;10, on the
marriage of his son, for the same purpose.&nbsp; These two sums
are in the hands of Viscount Hill, and he pays 20s. annually as
the interest thereof.</p>

Andrew William Corbett, Esq.&nbsp; At the census of 1801 the
population was returned at 120 souls <a name="page146"></a><span

The picturesque beauty of the village, surrounded by a lovely and
fertile country, and its contiguity to Haughmond Hill, which
commands a most delightful view of the surrounding district,
causes this to be a place of much attraction in the summer season
for pleasure parties from Shrewsbury and other places.&nbsp;
There is a good inn, with a spacious bowling green, which is kept
in admirable order, where parties may recreate themselves and
have every attention and comfort at a moderate charge, from the
worthy host of the &ldquo;Corbet Arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; A spacious
room which opens upon the bowling green will accommodate nearly a
hundred persons.</p>
<p>About half a mile east from Uffington is <span
class="smcap">Haughmond Hill</span>, from the summit of which is
seen a most beautiful, panoramic view of the fertile plains of
Shropshire, the lofty steeples of its ancient capital, the
windings of the graceful Severn, and in the distance the blue
mountains of Wales, whilst in the foreground is seen the stately
mansion of Sundorne Castle, adorned with battlements and turrets,
which forcibly reminds us of the beautiful lines of Mrs.
Hemans:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The stately homes of England,<br />
How beautiful they stand!<br />
Amidst their tall ancestral trees,<br />
O&rsquo;er all the pleasant land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the summit of the hill has been built a castellated
tower, which is a conspicuous object for many miles around.&nbsp;
Near the tower is a steep crag, down which the Earl of Douglas
leaped with his horse, on being closely pursued, after his escape
from the battle of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; He was seriously injured by
this daring act, and on his being taken prisoner, the king set
him at liberty, in admiration of his valour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to the Holy
Trinity, is a small fabric of venerable appearance, with a porch
on the south side, and a small belfry.&nbsp; The interior
harmonizes with the simplicity of the structure.&nbsp; The font
is large and circular.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy,
returned at &pound;49, in the patronage of Andrew William
Corbett, Esq.; incumbent, Rev. John Oliver Hopkins, M.A.&nbsp; In
the churchyard are several fine old yew trees.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pimley House</span> is a handsome
residence, pleasantly situated about a quarter of a mile from the
village.&nbsp; It stands on a gentle acclivity rising from the
Severn, and commands some fine prospects.&nbsp; The house was
completed in 1849; it is of brick, with stone finishings,
exhibiting the Elizabethan style of architecture.&nbsp; Pimley
House is the occasional residence of Andrew William Corbet, Esq.,
of Sundorne Castle.</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">Neat Schoolhouse</span> and residence
for the teachers was built in 1849, on the turnpike road leading
to Shrewsbury, by A. W. Corbet, Esq., who also munificently
supports the institution, which is free to all the children of
the tenants upon the Sundorne estate.&nbsp; There is also a good
Sunday school nearly opposite the church.&nbsp; This parish is
intersected by the river Severn, and the Shropshire union
canal.</p>

OSWESTRY HUNDRED.</h2>
<p>The Oswestry hundred is bounded on the east by the hundred of
Pimhill, on the north and west by Denbighshire, and on the
south-west by Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; The river Ceiriog bounds the
hundred at the northern extremity, and the Vernieu and the Severn
form the southern boundary.&nbsp; The population of this hundred
in 1821 was 17,189; and in 1841, 19,858, of whom 3,956 were in
the lower division of the hundred, and 15,902 in the upper
division.&nbsp; Of the total number of inhabitants at the latter
period, 9,805 were males, and 10,054 females.</p>
<p>The lower division of the hundred contains the following
parishes and townships, viz., Cotton, Dovaston, Eardiston,
Edgerley, Felton West, Haughton, Kinnerley, Knockin, Kynaston,
Maesbrook Issa, Maesbrook Ucha, Melverley, Osbaston, Rednal,

<h3>HALSTON,</h3>
<p>an Extra-parochial Liberty, three-quarters of a mile east from
Whittington, and three and a quarter miles E.N.E. from Oswestry,
contains upwards of 500 acres of land, which is the property of
Edmund Wright, Esq., of Halston Hall.&nbsp; This place formerly
belonged to the Knights Templars, or Knights of St. John of
Jerusalem.&nbsp; It is called in deeds Halystone, or Holystone,
and was formerly a sanctuary.&nbsp; Meyrick Lloyd, lord of some
part of Uwch Ales, in the reign of Richard I., would not submit
to the English government, to which the hundred of Dyffryn
Clwydd, and several others, were at that time subject; and having
seized some English officers, who came there to execute the laws,
put several of them to death.&nbsp; From this fact the lands were
forfeited to the king, and Lloyd fled and took sanctuary at
Halston, where its possessor, John Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel,
received him under his protection.&nbsp; It was given by this
family to the Knights Templars, and in the 26th of Henry VIII. we
find the commandary valued at &pound;160. 14s. 10d. a-year.&nbsp;
On the abolition of this religious order, King Henry VIII.
empowered John Sewster, Esq., to dispose of this manor to Alan
Horde, who made an exchange with Edward Mytton, Esq., which
alienation was confirmed by Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; Halston was
the birth place of the celebrated General Mytton, who was born in
1608.&nbsp; By his courage and conduct many strongholds in North
Wales and Shropshire were subdued, and he greatly distinguished
himself in several battles.&nbsp; An ardent love of liberty, it
seems, was the motive which governed his conduct; for finding
that Cromwell&rsquo;s views were ambitious, he resigned his
command and retired.&nbsp; General Mytton died in London, in
1656: his remains were conveyed to Shrewsbury, and interred in
St. Chad&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; The church or chapel is a small
fabric, situated in the park, about five hundred yards from the
south front of the hall.&nbsp; The interior is neatly fitted up,
and contains an ancient font, of an octagonal shape, rudely
carved; an old stone coffin which has been dug up, lies near the
tower.&nbsp; The living is a donative, without any other revenue
than what the chaplain is allowed by the owner.&nbsp; The Halston
estate, after being held by the Myttons from the time of Henry
VIII. to the present century was sold in 1817 to Edmund Wright,
Esq., the present proprietor.&nbsp; The hall, a spacious and
elegant mansion of brick <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>with a stone portico, has been
greatly improved by the present owner.&nbsp; It is beautified
with pleasure grounds and shrubberies, and opens into a beautiful
and finely-timbered park of about 200 acres.&nbsp; Near the front
of the hall is a fine sheet of water, and the river Perry, a
small stream, takes its course through the park.&nbsp; The
kitchen gardens are in a sheltered situation a little west from
the hall, and cover upwards of five acres.&nbsp; Pineries and
greenhouses are now in course of erection.&nbsp; At the census of
1841, Halston is returned as containing three houses and
thirty-four inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kinnerley and Argoed</span>, a township
and pleasantly situated village, seven miles S.E. from Oswestry,
and twelve miles N.W. by W. from Shrewsbury, contains 848<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 9<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, mostly an undulating district,
producing good wheat and barley.&nbsp; The principal land owners
are Edward Downes, Esq.; John Morris, Esq.; Mr. John Doune; Rev.
Thomas Frank; Mr. John Hilton; Mr. William Parkes; Mr. John
Lewis; Mr. Thomas Barlow; Mr. Henry Bowman; Mr. Edward Baddow;
Mr. John Pugh; Mr. Edward Evans; the vicar of Kinnerley; Mr.
Jones; Mr. Griffiths; and others.&nbsp; George Edwards, Esq., is
lord of the manor, and holds a court, the jurisdiction of which
extends over Kinnerley Argoed and Edgerley.&nbsp; It is stated in
ancient records that Kinnerley Castle was plundered and destroyed
by Llewellyn, prince of Wales, during the early part of the reign
of Henry III.&nbsp; We afterwards find that he was compelled to
promise to make satisfaction for the injury he had done; but it
appears the restoration of the castle never took place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Mary,
is built of red sandstone, and has a square tower, with the date
of 1600.&nbsp; The nave and chancel were enlarged and beautified
in 1755.&nbsp; There are several beautiful monuments in the
church, one of which remembers the Rev. John Bridgeman, D.D.,
bishop of Chester, who died in 1719.&nbsp; In the tower are three
fine-toned bells, which were re-cast at Kinnerley.&nbsp; It is
related that a farmer returning from Shrewsbury fair, where he
had sold two cows named Dobbin and Golden, passing the furnace,
was asked what he would give towards the new bells, when he
jocularly replied that he would give Dobbin and Golden, at the
same time emptying a large handkerchief of silver coin into the
furnace.&nbsp; From this circumstance the bells have ever since
been called Dobbin and Golden.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage,
valued in the King&rsquo;s book at &pound;7. 6s. 8d.; now
returned at &pound;114; in the patronage of the Lord Chancellor,
and incumbency of the Rev. Edmund Wolryche Orlando
Bridgeman.&nbsp; The vicarial tithes of this township are
commuted for &pound;18. 12s. 2d.; and &pound;103. 4s. 6d. are
paid to Mrs. Tayleur, and &pound;2. 16s. 6d. to other
impropriators.&nbsp; There are 30<span class="smcap">a</span>.

<h3>BLODWELL</h3>
<p>is a pleasant village in a hilly and romantic country, six

Earl of Bradford, Mrs. Aubrey, Rev. John Parker, John Bonner,
Esq.; John Edwards, Esq.; and John George Edwards, Esq.; the
former is lord of the manor.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Church</span>, dedicated to St. Michael, is a venerable fabric,
the exterior of which is now undergoing a complete reparation at
the expense of the present incumbent.&nbsp; The body of the
church is divided into two compartments, and has a pitched roof,
supported by columns and arches in the Norman style of
architecture.&nbsp; The chancel is tastefully decorated, and
contains a splendid stained glass window; it is fitted up with
stalls, and separated from the body of the church by an antique
oak screen, richly carved.&nbsp; The church has had additions and
alterations made at several different periods; in 1835 the
accommodation of the church was increased by the addition of 47
sittings.&nbsp; The chancel contains several handsome memorials,
one of which remembers the Bridgemans, of Blodwell; another very
elegantly designed is commemorative of the late Sir John
Bridgeman, Bart.; there are also monuments to the Godolphins,
Matthews, and others.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage valued in
the king&rsquo;s books at &pound;7. 12s. 6d., and now returned at
&pound;271 in the patronage of the bishop of St. Asaph, and
incumbency of the Rev. John Parker, M.A.&nbsp; Divine service is
performed alternately in the Welsh and English languages.&nbsp;
The vicarage is a modern and commodious erection of brick, in the
decorative style, with ornamental chimneys, and is situated a
short distance from the church; a considerable portion of the
house has been built by the present incumbent.&nbsp; The bishop
of St. Asaph is the impropriator of the large tithes, which are
commuted for &pound;211 9s. 6d., and the small tithes payable to
the vicar are commuted for &pound;36. 9s. 3d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Blodwell Hall</span>, a modern stuccoed
mansion delightfully situated, is the residence of William Lyons,
Esq.&nbsp; The hills above the hall command a scene of sublimity
and beauty, perhaps unsurpassed in any part of Wales.&nbsp; The
summits of innumerable mountains are seen at once, rising in
every variety of ridge, the distant in softest azure, and the
near clothed in the richest verdure, with hanging woods, fertile
meadows, and the bright rivers, Vernieu and Tanat, meandering at
the foot of the hills, on their way to join the sunny waters of
the magnificent Severn.&nbsp; Turning towards England, a perfect
contrast is presented, in the fertile and expansive plains of
Shropshire, richly wooded, and profuse in luxuriant vegetation,
terminated on the south by the noble Wrekin, and on the north and
east by the faint outline of the distant hills of Cheshire and
Stafford.&nbsp; The river Tanat is crossed by a stone bridge at
the point of separation of this township and that of Abertannat;
at the Grove about a mile and a half below Blodwell it has its
confluence with the river Vernieu, which here separates
Shropshire and Denbighshire.</p>

Bridgeman.&nbsp; In 1825 it was discovered that there was
&pound;300 stock in the old south sea annuities standing in the
names of trustees, but that no dividends had been received
thereon since the 6th April, 1801.&nbsp; In September, 1825,
&pound;211. 10s. was received for the arrears of dividends, out
of which sum &pound;57. 10s. 6d. was paid for the expense of
recovering them, of transferring the stock, and of the new trust
deed, and &pound;123. 7s. 2d. was expended in 1826 and 1827 in
re-building the school.&nbsp; Out of the dividends amounting to
&pound;9 per annum, &pound;7 is paid to the schoolmaster, the
residue having hitherto been reserved for repairs.&nbsp;
According to the deed of 1753 the master is entitled to
three-fourths of the dividends; 50 scholars attend the school,
which is partly supported by the vicar.</p>

roads.&nbsp; There are extensive lime works in this township: a
considerable quantity of that commodity is used by the farmers on
the western borders of Shropshire and in Wales for agricultural
purposes.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Llynck Lys Pool</span> is a
small but beautiful lake of great depth, of which strange and
superstitious tales prevailed in former times.&nbsp; It is <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>stated that
the lake was formerly the site of a royal palace, which in fairy
times was sunken below the earth by a fairy spell.&nbsp; The late
Mr. Dovaston, of the Nursery, in a ballad entitled &ldquo;Llynch
Lys,&rdquo; thus beautifully introduces the tradition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Still the villagers near, when the lake is
clear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Show the towers of the palace below,<br />
And of <i>Croes Willin</i> there, will the traveller hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the cave called the grim <i>Ogo</i>.</p>
<p>And oft from our boat of a summer&rsquo;s eve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet music is heard to flow,<br />
As we push from the side of the blue lake&rsquo;s tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the long green rushes grow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rushes and reeds which grow on the margin are of
extraordinary length; some have been drawn upwards of eighteen
feet in length.&nbsp; The water lily here flourishes with the
greatest luxuriance, and throws out a profusion of blossoms upon

<h3>LLANYMYNECH</h3>
<p>is a parish which contains the townships of
Llanymynech-Llanytidman and Treprenal, partly situated in this
county, and partly in the counties of Denbigh and Montgomery, in
Wales.&nbsp; The entire parish in 1801 had 596 inhabitants; in
1831, 887; and in 1841, 954.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;3,987.&nbsp; The village of Llanymynech is pleasantly
situated, six miles south from Oswestry, and ten miles N.W. by
S.S. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It has attained its present
importance from the extensive quarries of limestone with which
the vicinity abounds.&nbsp; Considerable quantities of the stone
are sent to the Staffordshire iron works, for fluxing the
metals.&nbsp; It is also burnt into lime.&nbsp; The Chester,
Ellesmere, and Newtown canal affords facilities for carrying the
material to distant parts.&nbsp; Copper ore was formerly found in
considerable quantities, but the mines have not been worked for
some time.&nbsp; There are 1,281 acres of land, the principal
owners of which are the Earl of Bradford; Earl Powis; John Lloyd,
Esq.; Richard Nightingale Broughton, Esq.; Rev. William Evans;
Rev. John Luxmoore; Robert Wall, Esq.; Mr. Parker; Philip
Jennings, Esq.; R. W. Kynaston, Esq.; T. W. Thomas, Esq.; Robert
Wall, Esq.; Rev. William Thomas; Mrs. Evans; Hon. Francis West;
Thomas West, Esq.; and Robert West, Esq.&nbsp; Earl Powis is lord
of the manor.&nbsp; The soil is various in this parish.&nbsp; The
meadow lands on the banks of the Vernieu are enriched by that
river frequently overflowing its banks.&nbsp; The river is here
crossed by a substantial stone bridge of three arches; and about
a mile and a half from the village a branch of the Ellesmere
canal is conducted over the river by an aqueduct of five arches,
near which it is joined by the Montgomeryshire canal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St.
Agatha, consists of nave, chancel, side aisles, and a square
tower with one bell.&nbsp; It was rebuilt in 1845, in the
decorative style of English <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>architecture, and exhibits some fine
chiselling and ornamental workmanship.&nbsp; The interior is
neatly pewed, and has a very chaste appearance.&nbsp; The living
is a rectory, valued in the King&rsquo;s book at &pound;12. 13s.
4d., now returned at &pound;394, in the patronage of the Bishop
of St. Asaph, and enjoyed by the Rev. John Luxmore, M.A.&nbsp;
The rectory, a neat stuccoed residence a short distance from the
church, has been much improved by the present incumbent.&nbsp;
The tithes are commuted for &pound;380.&nbsp; The National School
stands near the churchyard, and is supported by subscriptions and
a small charge from the scholars: about sixty children are
educated.&nbsp; There is a school for girls in the village.&nbsp;
Fairs are held on April 1st, May 29th, and September 23rd, and
are generally well attended.&nbsp; A coach leaves the Red Lion
Inn for Shrewsbury and Welshpool daily.</p>
<p>On Llanymynech hill is an artificial cave of considerable
length, called <i>Ogo</i> (from the Welsh word <i>Ogof</i>,
signifying a cave), supposed to have been worked by the Romans as
a copper mine.&nbsp; It contains many sinuosities, and is
generally about three yards wide, having many turnings and
passages connected with each other.&nbsp; Some years ago, all the
passages of this subterraneous labyrinth were explored by J. F.
M. Dovaston, Esq., when none of the paths were found to extend
more than two hundred yards from the entrance.&nbsp; The passages
are cut through the rock, which is of limestone, whereon
frequently appear the marks of chisels, and the various
ramifications have no doubt been made in quest of the rich veins
of ore.&nbsp; Subsequent to the Romans, it probably became either
a place of refuge after battle, or a depository for the dead, for
human skeletons, culinary vessels, hatchets, and Roman coins have
been found in this cavern.&nbsp; A finger-bone was picked up with
a ring on it.&nbsp; One of the skeletons had a curious battle-axe
beneath his arm, and not far from it were the bones of a man,
woman, a child, a dog, and a cat.&nbsp; Some time ago several
Roman coins, mostly of Constantine, were found in the earth which
was washed down the side of the hill.&nbsp; The water which drops
in some parts of the cave is of a petrifying quality, and forms
stalactites; the drops of water hanging on the points of each,
catch the light of the candle, and give the surrounding space a
glittering illumination extremely beautiful.&nbsp; It is probable
that a battle has been fought here in disputing for this mine, or
that the large entrenchments, that run parallel with the Clawdd
Offa eastwardly, were made to defend it.&nbsp; Not far from this
cave is a Cromlech, called the <span class="smcap">Giant&rsquo;s
Grave</span>.&nbsp; At the north-east end are four large stones,
which formerly supported a fifth flat stone on their points, in
form of a Brandart, called in Welsh <i>Trwbad</i>; but these are
now thrown down.&nbsp; Towards the south-west proceed two rows of
flat stones, six feet asunder, and thirty-six in length.&nbsp; On
digging here a Druid&rsquo;s celt was found, and several other
things, with human bones, the teeth very perfect.</p>
<p>There is a sum of &pound;26 in the hands of the churchwardens,
the origin of which is not known.&nbsp; It was received from the
executors of the late incumbent, who died in 1829.&nbsp; The
interest is distributed among poor women of the parish at
Christmas.</p>

<h3>ST. MARTIN</h3>
<p>is a parish, and small but pleasantly situated village, five
miles N.E. from Oswestry, and about the same distance W. from
Ellesmere.&nbsp; The parish comprises the townships of
Bronygarth, Ifton Rhyn, and Weston Rhyn, containing together
5,314<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>.
25<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and had in 1801, 1,476
inhabitants; in 1831, 2,099; and in 1841, 2,200.&nbsp; The
village of St. Martin is included in <span class="smcap">Ifton
Rhyn</span> township, which contains 2,813<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 33<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land; and at the census of 1841 had
217 houses and 1,620 souls.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;4,570.&nbsp; The principal land owners are the Right Hon.
Arthur Trevor Viscount Dungannon, of Bryn-Kinalt Castle, the Hon.
W. M. B. Nugent, Dean and Chapter of Winchester, R. G. Jebb,
Esq., J. Haslam, Esq., Joshua Jones, Esq., Mrs. Fallows, and
Edward H. Dymock, Esq.&nbsp; This township lies on the N.W.
confines of the county, and has some fine grazing land.&nbsp; It
is separated from Denbighshire by the Ceiriog river.&nbsp; The
Morlass brook here turns several corn mills, and has its
confluence with the Ceiriog about a mile from the Erewescob corn
mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St.
Martin, stands on an eminence, and is a conspicuous object for
many miles around.&nbsp; It consists of nave, north aisle,
chancel, and a massive square tower at the west end.&nbsp; The
side aisle is separated from the nave by five pointed arches
rising from octagonal pillars.&nbsp; The east end of the church
and the east window have recently been rebuilt; the lower part of
the window is divided into three compartments, and the upper part
is foliated, and ornamented with stained glass.&nbsp; The windows
on the south side of the church are also richly adorned with
stained glass.&nbsp; The one <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>near the pulpit has beautiful
representations of St. Peter and St. Paul; another has the
armorial bearings of the bishop of the diocese, the rural dean,
and the vicar.&nbsp; There are also the armorial bearings of
Viscount Dungannon, by whose munificence the church has been
renovated; and these beautiful decorations have been added within
these last twenty years.&nbsp; The old font, which is of stone,
has been re-hewn and modernized.&nbsp; A beautiful mural marble
monument remembers Richard Phillips, Esq., of Thyn-y-rhos, who
died in 1824, and his second son, Richard, ensign of the 17th
regiment of the Hon. East India Company&rsquo;s service, who died
at sea, off the Cape of Good Hope, on his return from India in
1832.&nbsp; There are also several other neat tablets in the
church.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;5. 2s. 3&frac12;d., now returned at
&pound;320, in the patronage of the Bishop of St. Asaph, and
enjoyed by the Rev. William Hurst, M.A.&nbsp; The Vicarage is a
neat residence, a little W. by S. from the church.&nbsp; The
vicarial tithes have been commuted for &pound;261, and the
rectorial for &pound;862.&nbsp; On the west side of the
churchyard is a lofty and finely proportioned elm tree, which is
seen at a great distance; and about a quarter of a mile west from
the church, near the toll-gate, stands a magnificent oak tree of
considerable magnitude.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ifton
Heath</span> is a scattered district, chiefly of detached
cottages, half a mile N.W. from the church.&nbsp; Here the
Primitive Methodists and the Wesleyan Association have each a
small chapel.&nbsp; The Primitive Methodists have also a chapel
on <span class="smcap">St. Martin&rsquo;s Moor</span>, a
scattered district of houses near a mile, W. by S. from the
church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Bryngwyla School</span>, situated about a mile W.W.
by S. from the church, was founded in 1705 by <i>Edward
Phillips</i>, for the instruction of twelve poor boys of the
parish of St. Martin to read and write.&nbsp; Mr. Phillips also
endowed the school with the sum of &pound;100, and directed
&pound;3. 12s. yearly to be paid to the schoolmaster, who was to
occupy the school-house rent free, on condition of his keeping
the premises in repair.&nbsp; The donor also directed 4d. to be
given to each boy every Ascension day for his encouragement; and
5s. to be expended by the vicar, trustees, and schoolmaster, in
remembrance of the benefactor.&nbsp; The master now receives
&pound;4. 13s. 6d. per annum, from which 5s. is paid to the
trustees, but nothing is paid to the children.&nbsp; The master
receives 25s. yearly in respect of John Price&rsquo;s charity
hereafter mentioned.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Almshouses</span>.&mdash;The almshouses
are situated near the west side of the churchyard.&nbsp; They
consist of six tenements, mantled with ivy, and are supported by
<i>Lord Dungannon</i>.&nbsp; The inmates are clothed, receive
15s. a quarter, a loaf of bread on Fridays, and two tons of coal
yearly.&nbsp; There is also a school, where twelve children are
clothed and educated.</p>
<p><i>Arthur Trevor</i>, of Kay Mark, left &pound;2 a-year; one
half to be given to the poor on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, and the
other half on Good Friday.&nbsp; The amount is paid by the agent
of Lord Dungannon.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Abellis</i> left 21s. per annum, payable out of a
piece of land called Cae-Rhoes.&nbsp; In 1812, Edward Birch, a
mortgagee, and Edward Jones, in consideration of &pound;220.
10s., conveyed to the Ellesmere Canal Company a parcel of land
called Cae Rhoes, and the said Edward Jones covenanted that he
would indemnify the said company from a rent-charge of 20s.,
payable out of the said premises.&nbsp; The property is still in
the possession of the Ellesmere Canal Company, but nothing had
been paid thereout to the poor for a period of twelve years when
the Charity Commissioners published their report.&nbsp;
Application had been made to Mr. Price, of Felton Butler, who
married the heiress of Mr. Jones, and he promised to continue the
payment of this rent-charge.</p>
<p><i>Edward Phillips</i> charged a piece of land with the
payment of 4s. yearly for the benefit of the poor.</p>
<p><i>John Price</i> bequeathed &pound;100, and directed the
interest of &pound;25 to be applied in the education of youth,
and the interest of &pound;75 to be bestowed in clothing for some
of the poorest parishioners.&nbsp; The amount is secured on a
piece of land in Weston Rhynn, from which &pound;5 are paid
yearly.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>There
are two cottages in the township of Soutley, in the parish of
March Weil, Denbighshire, adjoining premises purchased by the
governors of Queen Ann&rsquo;s Bounty, for the augmentation of
the vicarage of St. Martin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; These cottages have for
a length of time been let for the benefit of the poor; but it is
not known when or how the rents became thus appropriated.&nbsp;
They were repaired some time ago at an expense of &pound;30,
which was borrowed for this purpose, and they are now let for
&pound;6 a-year.&nbsp; Of the rent, &pound;3 is applied in paying
off the debt, and the remaining &pound;3 is given among the poor
on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p><i>Hugh Lloyd</i> left a rent-charge of 16s. per annum,
issuing out of certain lands, called Cae Dickin, in Weston Rhynn,
and directed the amount to be expended in sixteen dozen of bread,
to be distributed on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; It is stated
on the table of benefactions, that &ldquo;Richard Berkley, for
Hugh Lloyd, pays for ten dozen of bread on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day
for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gift of <i>Edward Edwards</i>, of 20s.
per annum to the poor of St. Martin&rsquo;s, is void under the
statute of 9 George II.&nbsp; It is stated in the parliamentary
returns of 1786, that <i>David Hughes</i> left &pound;10 for the
benefit of the poor; and among the parish documents there is a
bond, dated in 1746, from Thomas Phillips, of Trehowell, for the
payment of this money.&nbsp; Nothing, however, has been paid on
this account for many years.</p>

<p>is a township and scattered village from two to three miles W.
from St. Martin&rsquo;s Church, containing 1850<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 4<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and in 1841 here were 195 houses
and 856 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;4,053.&nbsp;
The principal land owners are Frederick Richard West, Esq.; Rev.
John C. Phillips; John Richard Powell, Esq.; Mr. James Edwards;
E. H. Dymoch, Esq.; T. E. Ward, Esq.; Mr. John Pritchard, and
Mrs. Dickin, Mr. Edward Heys, and others are also
proprietors.&nbsp; A neat and ornamental school, in the early
English style of architecture, was built in the year 1850 at the
Lodge.&nbsp; The structure is of stone got from the neighbouring
quarries, with the Cafn hewn stone for the windows and ornamental
portions of the building; it measures 20 feet by 40 feet, and has
a pitched roof with a neat belfry.&nbsp; The cost of the
structure was &pound;700, of which &pound;40 was given by the
National Society and &pound;130 by the Privy Council on
Education, the rest was raised by voluntary subscriptions.&nbsp;
A residence for the teacher adjoins the school.&nbsp; The
Calvinistic Methodists have a chapel at the lodge, built in 1811,
the services of which are conducted in the Welsh language.&nbsp;
Coal of a good quality is found upon the estate of John R.
Powell, Esq.; a steam engine is now in course of erection to
clear the mines of water.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Quinta</span>, a handsome castellated residence built of lime
stone, stands on a gentle acclivity, and commands some pleasing
views to the south.&nbsp; It is surrounded with shrubberies and
park-like grounds, and is the residence of Rowland Jones
Venables, Esq., and the property of F. R. West, Esq.&nbsp; On the
knoll of a hill a short distance from the hall, the owner of the
estate about ten years ago caused immense blocks of stone to be
reared up in the exact form of the celebrated Druidical Temple at
Stonehenge.&nbsp; From this eminence a most beautiful panoramic
view of the surrounding country is seen.&nbsp; <span

<h3>MELVERLEY,</h3>
<p>a parish and township with a scattered population, 12 miles
W.W. by N. from Shrewsbury, and 9 miles S.S. by E. from Oswestry,
is situated on the western verge of the county, and is separated
from Montgomeryshire by the river Vernieu and the Severn; the
former having its confluence with the Severn at the Cymmeran
Ferry.&nbsp; The parish contains 1,445<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 22<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, which from its low situation is
frequently inundated by the overflowing of the Severn, thus
enriching the meadows and producing the greatest luxuriance;
large herds of cattle are usually fed upon the meadows.&nbsp; In
1801 here was a population of 218 souls; in 1831, 216; and in
1841, 229.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;2,317 5s.&nbsp; The manor
in the time of the confessor was held by one Edric, in whose
family it continued till the 9th of Elizabeth, when Henry Earl of
Arundle sold it to Young, from whom it subsequently passed to the
Willastons.&nbsp; Lord Craven was afterwards lord of the manor,
and it is now vested in George Edwards, Esq.&nbsp; The
freeholders are Colonel Desbrow, Hon. Thomas Kenyon, Mrs. E.

<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Peter,
a large fabric of very primitive appearance, built of wood,
stands on an elevated piece of ground near the banks of the
Vernieu; part of it was swept away subsequent to the year
1478.&nbsp; Although the workmanship is of the rudest
description, yet the magnitude of the building and the fine old
porch, give it an attractive and venerable appearance.&nbsp; The
windows are small and admit of very little light.&nbsp; It

pews in 1718, previous to which it was provided with massive

the patronage of the bishop of St. Asaph, and enjoyed by the Rev.
Henry Rogers.&nbsp; The tithes were commuted in 1841 for
&pound;177. 11s., and there are five acres of glebe.&nbsp; The
parsonage is a neat residence of brick in the Elizabethan style

<h3>OSWESTRY</h3>
<p>is a parish, borough, and considerable market town, locally
situated in the hundred to which it gives name, seventeen miles
and a half N.W. from Shrewsbury, and 179 miles N.W. from
London.&nbsp; The name of Oswestry is connected with some of our
earliest historical recollections.&nbsp; On this spot, on August
5th, 652, was fought the battle between the Christian Oswald,
king of the Northumbrians, and the Pagan Penda, king of the
Mercians.&nbsp; Oswald was defeated, and lost his life.&nbsp; The
battle began about four hundred yards west of the church.&nbsp;
The assailant appears to have driven Penda&rsquo;s forces to a
field near the town, called Cae Nef, where Oswald fell, and
Penda, with a savage barbarity, caused the breathless body to be
cut to pieces, and stuck on poles as so many trophies of his
victory.&nbsp; Oswald&rsquo;s strict virtue, and zeal for the
religion he had embraced, gained him the esteem of his subjects,
and his character was so much revered by the monks, that a short
time after his death he was canonized.&nbsp; The importance of
the situation, which rendered it one of the keys to the
principality of Wales, soon attracted the attention of the
political monarch, whose prowess annexed that territory to his
dominion.&nbsp; This place was called by the ancient Britons
Tre&rsquo;r-cadeirian, literally the town of chairs or seats
commanding an extensive view.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the place was
Welsh, and continued so above a century after the death of King
Oswald, yet it has since gone under his name, and for some time
was famed for the miracles wrought there through his
intercession.&nbsp; An ancient poet in noticing Oswald and the
fate of Penda says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Three gibbets raised, at Penda&rsquo;s dire
commands,<br />
Bore Oswald&rsquo;s royal head and mangled hands;<br />
The tenor of the fact, and Oswald&rsquo;s fate,<br />
Were things of moment to the Mercian state.<br />
Vain policy! for what the victor got<br />
Proved to the vanquished king the happier lot;<br />
For now the martyred saint in glory views,<br />
How Oswy with success the war renews;<br />
And Penda scarcely can maintain his own,<br />
Whilst Oswald wears a never fading crown.&rdquo;</p>

164</span>Oswestry is one of the principal towns on the Welsh
borders, and is now the most flourishing and prosperous of any in
the county.&nbsp; In 1801 there were 2,672 inhabitants; in 1831,
4,478; and in 1841, 987 houses and 4,566 souls; of whom 2,121
were males, and 2,445 females.&nbsp; The entire parish of
Oswestry, including the town and liberties of Oswestry in 1841,
contained 8,843 inhabitants.&nbsp; The town is situated on a
gentle eminence, the streets are in general spacious, and there
are many good houses, and retail shops in all the different
branches of trade; yet vestiges of its antiquity, timbered
buildings with projecting gables, are still to be seen in various
parts of the town.&nbsp; The beautiful prospects from the high
ground above the town are perhaps not surpassed by any in the
county.&nbsp; The rich and luxuriant vale of Shropshire lies as
it were a map beneath the feet; while the Staffordshire hills,
Nesscliff, the Wrekin, and the Styperstones, are seen in the
distance.&nbsp; Towards Wales, the alpine heights and lovely
vales are seen in rich profusion; and here the beholder glances
upon a country which was eminently distinguished as the
birth-place and residence of the children of freedom&mdash;a
people, who, by their independent spirit and martial prowess, for
centuries chastised rapacity and injustice, and made oppression
and tyranny tremble upon the throne.&nbsp; The parish of Oswestry
contains the townships of Aston, Cynyion, Crickheath, Hisland,
Llanvorda, Maesbury, Middleton, Morton, Oswestry, Pentregaer,
Sweeney Trefraclawdd, Trevlock, Trefonen, Weston Cotton, and
Wootton.</p>
<p>The Britons were in the possession of Oswestry till the latter
part of the eighth century, when the warlike King Offa, passing
the Severn with a mighty force, expelled them from their fruitful
seats on the plains, and reduced the kingdom of Powis to the
western side of the celebrated ditch still known by his
name.&nbsp; The princes of Powis were then constrained to quit
their ancient residence at Pengwern and remove to Mathrafel, in
the vale of Myfod, and the plains of Shropshire became a
confirmed part of the kingdom of Mercia.&nbsp; The Britons
shortly after entered into an alliance with the king of Sussex
and Northumberland, and, having made a breach in the rampart,
passed the boundary at early dawn, attacked the camp of Offa in
an unprepared state, and put great numbers to the sword.&nbsp; In
the middle of the following century, we find Roderic, Prince of
Wales, added Powisland to his dominions.&nbsp; He, according to
the custom of gavel-kind, divided his principality among his
children.&nbsp; To Anarawd he gave North Wales; to Cadell, South
Wales; to Mervyn, Powisland.&nbsp; Each wore a talaith, or
diamond of gold, set with precious stones; whence they were
styled Y Tri Tywysog Taleithiog, or the three crowned
princes.&nbsp; Bleddyn ap Cynoyn, who ruled Wales jointly with
his brother, at the Conquest re-united the kingdoms of North
Wales and Powis.&nbsp; The latter, however, eventually devolved
to his eldest son, Meredydd, and Oswestry was called Trefred, in
honour of this prince.&nbsp; He made the division, which finally
destroyed the potent kingdom of Powis.&nbsp; To his eldest son,
Madog, he gave the part which bore afterwards the name of Powis
Madog.&nbsp; Madog&rsquo;s chief residence was at Oswestry,
where, according to Welsh historians, he built the castle about
the year 1140.&nbsp; He died at Winchester, and his body was
honourably conveyed to Powis, and buried at Myfod.&nbsp; His
widow married Fitzalan, Lord of Clun; who, in right of his wife,
obtained the town and castle of Oswestry.&nbsp; This William was
a descendant of Alan, who came into England with the Conqueror,
and was the first of the Fitzalans that was baron of
Oswestry.&nbsp; This honourable distinction was possessed by the
Fitzalans, a powerful race, that existed with fewer checks than
common to dignity for more than five hundred years.&nbsp; The
title of Baron of &ldquo;Oswaldestre&rdquo; is now held by the
Duke of Norfolk.&nbsp; His ancestor, Thomas Duke of Norfolk,
married Lady Mary, daughter of Henry, the last Earl of Arundel,
of the name of Fitzalan, in the 13th of Elizabeth, when the
lordship of Oswestry was conveyed to the duke.&nbsp; The Powis
family subsequently became possessed of the manor.&nbsp;
Powisland extended from the Broxton hills, in Cheshire, to
Pengwerne Powis, or Shrewsbury, including a large tract of land
in both those counties, and also comprehended a considerable <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>portion of
Wales.&nbsp; This part of England, previous to the reign of
Edward II., was termed the Northern Marches, and was governed by
a Lord President, who kept his court at Ludlow Castle, and lived
in a style little inferior to that of royalty.</p>
<p>The town of Oswestry had various immunities and privileges
granted by different monarchs.&nbsp; In the 12th of Henry III.
John Fitzalan obtained the grant of a fair at his manor of
Blancminster, upon the eve, the day, and the day after the feast
of St. Andrew, and for two days following.&nbsp; Edward I.
surrounded Oswestry with walls, that it might be less liable to
plundering excursions, and as a key to his intended conquest of
Wales.&nbsp; A murage or toll was imposed upon the whole county
(except the burgesses of Shrewsbury) for the building of the same
for a period of six years.&nbsp; The walls were about a mile in
circumference, with an entrenchment on the outside, which could
be filled with water from the numerous springs in the
vicinity.&nbsp; The remains of this fortification may still be
traced.&nbsp; There were also four gates, the only inlets into
the town.&nbsp; These gates, in process of time, became
exceedingly inconvenient for the passage of carriages and
merchandise, and the Blackgate was taken down in 1766, by the
consent of Earl Powis, the lord of the manor.&nbsp; In 1782, the
corporation entered into an agreement for the demolition of the
three remaining gates, and appropriating the materials to the
erecting of a prison.&nbsp; This was carried into effect, and
pillars substituted in their stead.&nbsp; The New Gate was built
in the reign of Edward II.&nbsp; It was used as a prison and
guard-room for the soldiers.&nbsp; <i>Beatrice Gate</i> is said
to have been named in compliment to Beatrice, wife of Henry IV.,
and was probably erected in that king&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp;
<i>Willow Gate</i> or <i>Wallia Gate</i> took its name from being
the thoroughfare into Wales.</p>
<p>The governing charter, previous to the date of the municipal
act, was one of 25th Charles II., styling the corporation the
&ldquo;Mayor, Aldermen, Common Council, and Burgesses, of the
Borough of Oswestry, in the County of Salop,&rdquo; and
appointing a mayor, fifteen aldermen, fifteen common councilmen,
a steward of the lord of the manor, recorder, coroner, or old
mayor, town clerk, &amp;c.&nbsp; The mayor, steward, coroner, and
recorder, were appointed to act as justices of peace for the
borough.&nbsp; A court of quarter sessions for the criminal
jurisdiction within the borough was appointed to be held by the
mayor, as president, and one to three of the magistrates.&nbsp;
The boundaries were from the beginning restricted to a certain
district within the parish, and in the maps of the municipal
boundary commissioners they are still further restricted to the
more immediate vicinity of the town.&nbsp; Under the new
municipal act, the borough is divided into two wards, and
appointed to be governed by six aldermen and eighteen
councillors, under the usual corporate style.&nbsp; It is
included in schedule A among the boroughs to have a commission of
the peace, which has accordingly been granted.&nbsp; The
following is a list of persons who have served the office of
mayor since the new municipal act came into
operation:&mdash;1835, John Croxon, Esq.; 1836, Francis Campbell,
Esq.; 1837, Charles Thomas Jones, Esq.; 1838, George Dorsett
Owen, Esq.; 1839, Griffith Evans, Esq.; 1840, Thomas Penson,
Esq.; 1841, John Hayward, Esq.; 1842&ndash;3, William Williams,
Esq.; 1844, William Price, Esq.; 1845, Thomas Rogers, Esq.; 1846,
John Miles Hales, Esq.; 1847, Thomas Hill, Esq.; 1848, John
Jones, Esq.; 1849&ndash;50, Edward Morris, Esq.&nbsp; The
magistrates who act in the Oswestry district are Joseph V.
Lovett, Esq., Thomas Lovett, Esq., Richard H. Kinchant, Esq., W.
W. E. Wynne, Esq., the Hon. Thomas Kenyon, and Viscount
Dungannon.</p>
<p><i>Recorder</i>: John Robert Kenyon, Esq.&nbsp;
<i>Coroner</i>: John Miles Hayes, Esq.&nbsp; <i>Town Clerk and
Clerk to Magistrates</i>: Richard Jones Croxon, Esq.&nbsp;
<i>Clerk of the Peace</i>: Robert Simon, Esq.&nbsp;
<i>Surveyor</i>: Mr. Thomas Hughes.&nbsp; <i>Treasurer</i>: Mr.
George Cooper.&nbsp; <i>Superintendent of Police and Clerk and
Inspector of Markets</i>: Mr. Jacob Smith.&nbsp; The police force
consists of a superintendent and six constables.&nbsp; The income
of the borough for the year ending September, 1st, 1850, was
&pound;706. 8s. 5d.&nbsp; The principal items of expenditure were
for salaries, &pound;180; police constables and watchmen,
&pound;143; prosecutions, &pound;65; gaol expenses, &pound;144;
conveyance of prisoners, &pound;29; and miscellaneous expenses,
&pound;152.</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>For
upwards of two hundred years the Welsh webs were brought to
Oswestry, as the common market, and there bought by the
Shrewsbury drapers.&nbsp; The Welsh wished to draw the trade more
into their own country, but the English purchaser could not be
persuaded to follow them, on account of the unsettled state of
the Principality; and thus Oswestry was constituted an emporium
of merchandise, in consequence of its contiguity to Wales.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Company of Drapers&rdquo; in Shrewsbury made a weekly
visit to Oswestry to purchase the cloths.&nbsp; The peril
attending these pilgrimages must have been considerable, if we
may judge from an order appearing in the records of the
Shrewsbury corporation, where, in the 25th of Elizabeth, 1583, it
was ordered, that &ldquo;no draper set out for Oswestry on
Mondays before six o&rsquo;clock, on forfeiture of 6s. 8d., and
that they shall wear their weapons all the way, and go in
company.&rdquo;&nbsp; The corporation paid yearly the sum of
&pound;20 to the vicar of St. Alkmund for reading prayers; 6s.
8d. for the light; and 6s. 8d. to the clerk for ringing the bell
on Monday mornings, before the drapers set out for Oswestry
market.&nbsp; In 1621, it was agreed by the drapers to buy no
more cloths in Oswestry.&nbsp; The then recorder of Oswestry
regarded this withdrawment as inevitably ruinous, and says,
&ldquo;Oswestry flourished and was happy indeed by reason of the
market of Welsh cottons.&nbsp; A thousand pounds in ready money
was left in the town every week, sometimes more; but now, since
the staple of cloth is removed to Shrewsbury, the town is much
decayed and impoverished, Shrewsbury having engrossed the said
market.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the defence of the rights secured to the
burgesses by the various municipal charters, the members of each
trade formed themselves into a guild or company, whose duties it
was to guard the monopolies of the brotherhood.&nbsp; Thus we
have notices of the company of hatters, glovers, butchers,
corvsers, bakers, hucksters, and ale sellers.&nbsp; The charter
of Richard II. directs &ldquo;that the bailiff should treat as
well the poor as the rich, and that the burgesses within the town
and liberty should be quit of tolls and stallage.&nbsp; That none
but burgesses should buy any fresh hides or new cloth in the
borough.&nbsp; That they should not be bound to keep any fugitive
coming to the church or churchyard, except only for one day and
one night next after such flight, within which time they should
give notice to the bailiff of the hundred, who should take such
fugitive into custody.&nbsp; That the burgesses should be
discharged from all fees of the constable, usher, and door-keeper
of the castle, for any felonies committed within the town, for
which such burgesses might be imprisoned in the castle, except
that the constable at the feast of St. Stephen should receive
from every mansion of the burgesses one loaf, from every hall one
penny, and from every cottage one halfpenny.&nbsp; That the
penalty of 6s. 8d. should be imposed for selling Shrewsbury ale
in the town, half of such fine to go to the burgesses, and half
to the lord.&nbsp; That no such ale should be sold in the town of
Chirkslound, Melverdeley, and Kinnardeley, except in the town of
Chirk, under the like penalty.&nbsp; That none of the inhabitants
of those lordships, or of Oswestry, Edgerley, and Ruyton, should
take any cattle, corn, victuals, or other articles to any foreign
fair or market, until the same had been exposed for sale in the
town of Oswestry, under the penalty of 6s. 8d.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Philip, Earl of Arundel, in the year 1581, affected an uncommon
concern for the well doing of the town, and in a charter of that
date he states &ldquo;that by the misconstruction of certain
words of the charters theretofore given to the town, several acts
which ought to have been passed by the common council, had been
done and proceeded in by the general voice of all the
co-burgesses, whereby contentions and suits of law were
occasioned by such popular governments.&nbsp; Therefore for the
quiet and better ordering of the said town,&rdquo; he arbitrarily
appoints the mode of election, directs an oath to be taken by all
the burgesses to be loyal and faithful to the Queen&rsquo;s
Majesty, and to be loving and dutiful to the said earl and his
heirs, grants them a number of privileges, which had been
enjoyed, as he states, from time immemorial, and, with true
baronial modesty, not till the close does he discover the secret
of all this paternal affection, by the significant
clause,&mdash;&ldquo;In consideration of all which agreements,
and to the intent that the said bailiffs and burgesses may show
their loyalty and good will to the said noble earl, they do
undertake to pay him one bundled pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>In
the year 1400 Oswestry was burnt during an insurrection of the
Welsh.&nbsp; After a peaceable submission of upwards of a
century, they made an attempt to regain their ancient
independence under the renowned Owain Glyndwr.&nbsp; Lord Grey
had unjustly seized upon some part of Glyndwr&rsquo;s estates,
which lay between Llangolen and Corwen.&nbsp; Owain sought
satisfaction without having recourse to parliament, but he met
with no redress.&nbsp; He, therefore, animated by his descent
from the ancient line of British princes, caused himself to be
proclaimed Prince of Wales on September 20th, 1400, and commenced
his warlike career by attacking his enemy, Lord Grey, from whom
he immediately recovered the lands which that nobleman had
deprived him of.&nbsp; Relying on the valour of his soldiers and
the inaccessible mountains of his country, he set at defiance the
whole power of England.&nbsp; He assembled his forces at
Oswestry, in order to join Lord Percy against the king.&nbsp; The
Welsh chieftain sent off his first division of 4,000 men (an
account of which has been noticed in a preceding page), and at
the head of 12,000 men had the mortification of being obliged to
remain inactive at Oswestry.&nbsp; Gough observes, that about two
miles from Shrewsbury, where the Welshpool road diverges from
that which leads to Oswestry, there stands an ancient decayed oak
tree, of which there is a tradition, that Glyndwr ascended it to
reconnoitre; but finding that the king was in great force, and
that the Earl of Northumberland had not joined his son, Percy, he
fell back to Oswestry, and immediately after the battle retreated
precipitately into Wales.&nbsp; In 1409 Glyndwr made great
devastations in the Marches, and the estates of Lord Powis
suffered greatly.&nbsp; Several of the officers of the lords of
the Marches, for the sake of preserving their country from the
fury of the Welsh, by their own authority formed a truce with
Glyndwr and his partizans.&nbsp; King Henry, highly indignant at
these agreements, immediately issued writs to the lords of
Knockin, Ellesmere, and other bordering manors, to cause such
illegal compacts to be rescinded, and Glyndwr and his adherents
to be pursued and attacked with the utmost vigour.&nbsp; Owain
appears after this to have secured himself in the mountainous
districts of Wales, and to have acted entirely upon the
defensive.&nbsp; He died on the 20th of December, 1415.</p>
<p>That dreadful scourge the plague raged in Oswestry in 1559,
and continued throughout the principal part of the year, during
which time upwards of five hundred persons were swept away.&nbsp;
About half a mile from the town, on the Welshpool road, is <span
class="smcap">Croes wylan</span>, where a cross formerly stood,
the base of which still remains.&nbsp; During the time of the
plague, the market is said to have been held at this cross, lest
the country people by coming into the town should be
infected.&nbsp; The plague again appeared in Oswestry in 1585,
which the parish register states began in March, and continued
until July, when three score and four persons died.&nbsp; The
market for the sale of the flannel webs was held at Knockin until
the calamity abated.&nbsp; In 1542 there was a fire in the town,
by which two long streets, with extensive property, were
consumed.&nbsp; In 1567 a fire again broke out and burnt two
hundred houses.&nbsp; The houses were then principally built of
timber.&nbsp; Leland, who passed through Oswestry in the time of
Henry VIII., says, &ldquo;There be within the town X notable
streates: the iii. most notable streates be the Cross streate,
the Bayly streate, and Newgate streate. with barns for corn and
hay to the number VII. score several barns.&nbsp; There is a
castelle set on a mont, be likelihood made by hand, and ditched
by south west, betwixt Beatrice streate and Willow gate, to which
the wall commith.&nbsp; The towne standeth most by sale of cloth
made in Wales.&nbsp; There goeth thro&rsquo; the towne by the
Crosse a broke, comming from a place caullid Simon&rsquo;s well,
a bow-shot without the waulle by N.W.&nbsp; This broke commith in
by the waulle betwixt Willow gate and New-gate, and so renning
through the towne, goith out under the Black-gate.&nbsp; There be
no towers on the waulles beside the gates.&nbsp; The towne is
dicked about, and brokettes ren ynto it.&nbsp; The chirch of St.
Oswalde is a very fair leddid church, with a great tourrid
steple, and it standeth without the New-gate; so that no church
is there within the towne.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Castle</span>.&mdash;The remains of
the cattle consist only of an artificial mount on the north side
of the town.&nbsp; It had a deep ditch extending to Beatrice gate
on the one side <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>and Willow gate on the other.&nbsp; According to
Caradoc, the Welsh historian, the castle was founded in 1149, by
Madoc, Prince of Powis.&nbsp; Leland says a tower went by the
name of Madoc&rsquo;s tower, which seems to confirm the account
respecting the founder of the castle.&nbsp; The English
historians, however, assign to it a more ancient date, and inform
us that it was in being before the Norman conquest, and that Alan
had the town and castle bestowed upon him by William the
Conqueror soon after his accession.&nbsp; In the 15th of John,
John, nephew of William Mareschall, Earl of Pembroke, being
guardian of the Marches of Wales, was at that time constituted
governor of the castles of Blancminster and Shrawarden, in the
county of Salop.&nbsp; Llewellin, son of Griffin, son of Madoc,
made his complaint to the archbishop of Canterbury against this
constable of Oswestry, for disturbing him in the possession of
the third part of the ville of Ledrot, and who had compelled him
to send two young noblemen to be put to death in an ignominious
manner, in derogation of their birth and extraction, which
disgrace their parents would not have undergone for &pound;300
sterling; also that the constable had twice imprisoned sixty of
his men, for which they were forced to pay 10s. a man for their
liberty; also that when the Welsh came to Oswestry fair, the
constable would seize their cattle by driving them into the
castle, and refusing to pay for the same.&nbsp; The castle and
manor continued in the possession of the Fitzalans, with little
interruption until the reign of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; The square
now called Bailey-head was the <i>ballium</i> or yard of the
castle.&nbsp; A mount in the castle field outside the great ditch
is the site of the Barbican, or the outer gate at which the halt
and blind were usually relieved, and is still called the cripple
gate.&nbsp; Within the precincts of the castle there stood a
chapel, dedicated to St. Nicholas, wherein during troublous times
religious services were performed.&nbsp; The castle was
garrisoned for Charles I. in the beginning of the civil wars; a
Colonel Lloyd was governor, Sir A. Shipman succeeded him, and
continued in that post until the town and castle surrendered to
the parliamentary forces under the Earl of Denbigh and General
Mytton, the 22nd June, 1644.&nbsp; Gough, in his manuscript
history of Middle, relates, in his own quaint manner, the assault
and capture of Oswestry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will speak of some things
that have happened here in my time.&nbsp; The governor of this
town, when it was a garrison for the king, pulled down many
houses that were without the walls, lest they might shelter an
enemy; the church also being without the walls was pulled down,
and the top of the steeple only leaving where the bell frame
stood; the bells were brought into the town and the organs were
embezzled after.&nbsp; The town was well fortified, and the
castle, which is but small, yet very strong, built by a Prince of
Wales, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, 1149.&nbsp; General
Mitton, with parliament forces, came and besieged it; he planted
his cannon near that part of the steeple which was left; he
battered the gate, called Church gate in such sort, that the
garrison of soldiers could not stay at it.&nbsp; General Mitton
supposing it was so, but not being sure of it, sent George
Cranage, a bold and daring young man, to see whether it were so,
who took a hatchet in his hand and went to the drawbridge, and
found that the soldiers were gone, and the gate was open, for the
cannon had broken the doors, and this Cranage broke the chains of
the draw bridge with the hatchet, and let it down, so that the
soldiers made haste to enter the town, but those who were within
made like haste to meet them, which Cranage perceiving, and
seeing a box of drakes standing within the gate ready charged, he
turned the box of drakes towards those in the town, and one of
Cranage&rsquo;s partners came with a fire lock and gave fire to
them, which made such slaughter amongst the garrison that they
retreated and fled to the castle.&nbsp; Cranage was well
rewarded, and being well filled with sack, was persuaded by the
general to hang a battau on the castle gate; now a battau is an
iron shell as big as an iron pot; it was filled with powder and
wild fire balls, and had a handle with a hole in it, by which it
might be fastened with a nail to any place.&nbsp; Cranage takes
this battau, with a cart nail and a hammer, and got from house to
house into the house next the castle, and then stepping to the

169</span>without any hurt.&nbsp; The battau burst open the
gate.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inmates were granted quarter, but the
royalists failed notwithstanding several attempts to regain the
town.&nbsp; The castle was shortly afterwards demolished, and
nothing is now to be seen of it but a lofty circular mount.</p>
<p>About half a mile N.W. from the town of Oswestry is an
insulated eminence of an oblong form, surrounded by two ramparts
and fosses of great height and depth, which in former days was
known by the name of <i>Caer Ogyrfan</i> and <i>Hen Dinas</i>,
but now recognized by the title of <span class="smcap">Old
Oswestry</span>.&nbsp; This elevation bears the strongest marks
of having been at some time a place of defence; the top is an
extensive area containing 15<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 0<span class="smcap">p</span>., and the
fortifications which encompass it cannot be less than forty or
fifty acres.&nbsp; A gentleman who visited this spot in 1797 says
that a well and pavement had been discovered here.&nbsp; Some
pieces of iron supposed to be armour had been dug up.&nbsp; The
original entrance to this fortification appears to have been on
the opposite side of the hill from the great Holyhead road.&nbsp;
There is strong ground for the belief that this eminence was the
original site of the town, which afterwards took and now bears
the name of Oswestry, and that it was planted there by the
ancient Britons at a very remote period.&nbsp; That it was known
to the Britons will appear evident from the fact of both the
names we have mentioned as having been applied to it being
British or Welsh, Caer Ogyrfan signifying &ldquo;The Field of
Ogyrfan,&rdquo; who was contemporary with King Arthur, and Hen
Dinas signifying &ldquo;The Old City.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is evident
that this magnificent work was not a sudden operation like that
of a camp, but that it was a work of immense labour and ample
security.&nbsp; The character of the elevation answers to the
description given of the position of ancient British towns.&nbsp;
They are said almost always to have been placed on a hill, and
Speed tells us that the Britons &ldquo;gave the name of townes to
certain combersome woods which they had fortified with ramparts
and ditches, whither they resort and retreat, to eschue the
invasion of their enemies, which stand them in good stead, for
when they have by felling trees mounted and fenced therewith a
spacious plot of ground, there they build for themselves houses
and cottages.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1767 as much timber was cut down
from the ramparts as sold for &pound;17,000.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Mary,
is a fine old fabric of considerable magnitude, ornamented with a
massive square tower at the west end, in which are eight musical
bells.&nbsp; The structure was enlarged and beautified in 1807,
and since that period it has undergone great improvements.&nbsp;
A handsome organ was erected by subscription in 1812; it is
stated that the old organ, a fine toned instrument, is now in one
of the churches in London.&nbsp; The chancel, commonly called St.
Mary&rsquo;s, was destroyed in 1616, and the tower and part of
the body of the church were demolished in the civil wars of
1644.&nbsp; The vicarage house, which stood on a piece of ground
adjoining the churchyard, with many other buildings, were burnt
to the ground at the same period, in consequence of the town
being besieged.&nbsp; The church contains many handsome tablets
and monumental inscriptions, among which is a beautiful canopy of
elaborate workmanship, and underneath it two figures in the
attitude of prayer, in memory of Hugh Yale, alderman of this
town, and Dorothy, his wife, whose bodies were interred within
the chancel of this church, before its demolition in 1616.&nbsp;
On the north side of the chancel is an elegant mural monument,
with a latin inscription, commemorative of Richard Maurice, who
died in 1700, and other members of the family who died at a
subsequent period.&nbsp; A superb monument at the east end of the
chancel remembers Robert Powell Lloyd, who died in 1769, aged
five years; Sarah Lloyd, mother of the above, who died in 1790;
and Robert Lloyd, Esq., the father, who died in 1793.&nbsp; A
neat tablet at the same end records the death of the Rev. Thomas
Trevor, in 1784, vicar of this parish 50 years, and of Rhuabon 15
years, chaplain to W. W. Wynne, Bart., and one of his
Majesty&rsquo;s justices of the peace for the counties of Salop
and Denbigh.&nbsp; There are various other marble tablets, some
of them beautifully executed, which our limits will not allow us
to <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>notice.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;23. 15s. 7&frac12;d., now returned at
&pound;507, in the patronage of the Earl of Powis, and incumbency
of the Rev. Thomas Salway.&nbsp; The iron gates facing the town
were put up in 1738 at the expense of the parish, at a cost of
&pound;46 1s. 4d.&nbsp; The churchyard was enlarged in
1817.&nbsp; The elm trees were planted between the years 1707 and
1713.&nbsp; The vicarial tithes upon 1,832<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 23<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land in the town and liberties of
Oswestry are commuted for &pound;70 1s. 6d., and the rectorial
for &pound;211. &pound;13s. 6d.&nbsp; There are 82<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 7<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land tithe free.&nbsp; Earl Powis is
the impropriator and lord of the manor.&nbsp; The principal
landowners are Earl Powis, W. W. Wynn, Bart.; Earl of Bradford;
Richard Jones Croxon, Esq.; William Ormsby Gore, M.P.; Mrs.
Lloyd, Thomas L. Longueville, Esq.; and Mr. Williams, besides
whom are several other proprietors.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Trinity Church</span>, situate in the
Salop road, a neat fabric built of free stone in the decorative
style of English architecture, was erected in 1837; it consists
of nave and chancel, and the roof is of groined timber, which
gives it a very interesting appearance.&nbsp; There are 670
sittings, of which 400 are declared free and unappropriated for
ever, in consequence of a grant from the Incorporated Society,
for building and enlarging churches.&nbsp; There are 28 pews in
the body of the church, 29 in the gallery, and the free sittings
are open benches.&nbsp; The gallery contains a small organ, which
was presented to the church, on the condition that the incumbent
for the time being be allowed to receive the rent of the six pews
in front of the communion table, in lieu of the pews in the
gallery, partly taken up by the organ, and partly thrown open as
free sittings.&nbsp; The chancel exhibits some fine chiselling
and decorative workmanship; the east window is also richly
adorned with stained glass.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual
curacy returned at &pound;450, in the gift of the vicar of
Oswestry, and is enjoyed by the Rev. John Jones.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span>, situate in
Arthur-street, is a commodious and well built brick structure,
with stone finishings, and a portico of the Doric order, which
gives it a chaste appearance.&nbsp; The pews are arranged in a
semicircular form, and there is a gallery; it will accommodate
about 600 hearers.&nbsp; There is a flourishing society and a
Sunday school in connection with the chapel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Baptist Chapel</span>, situated in
Smithfield, was built in 1805, and enlarged in 1818; it is
provided with galleries, and will hold 300 persons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Methodist Chapel</span> is a good
brick structure, erected in 1811, in the Salop road, and will
accommodate 400 worshippers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Primitive Methodist Chapel</span>,
built in 1801, and situated in Castle Fields, is a brick building
cemented; it is neatly pewed and calculated to hold 600
hearers.&nbsp; There is a small burial ground annexed to the
chapel, and a house has been built for the resident minister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Welsh Independent Chapel</span>, a
small fabric, is situated in Castle Fields.&nbsp; Divine service
is performed in the Welsh language.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Welsh Calvinistic Chapel</span> (<span
class="smcap">Zion</span>), a good building of brick with a
stuccoed front, is situated in Gateacre place, and was erected in
1836.&nbsp; The interior arrangements have a neat
appearance.&nbsp; The service of this chapel is also in the Welsh
language.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Welsh Methodists</span> meet for
worship in a room near the Welsh walls.&nbsp; The society
contemplate building a chapel in a short period.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Plymouth Brethren</span> assemble for
worship in a large room on the premises of Mrs. Macdongall, in
Bailey street.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Methodists</span> have a
small chapel in Castle Terrace, built in 1848, which will hold
about 150 hearers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The National School</span>, situate at
Pentrepoeth, is a handsome building, in the Elizabethan style of
architecture, with a convenient residence for the teacher.&nbsp;
The centre of the building is occupied by the girls, and the
wings on each side are for the accommodation of the boys and the
infants.&nbsp; The school is pleasantly situated, has a <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>play ground
attached, and the whole is enclosed by a wall.&nbsp; The
institution is supported by subscription, and a small charge from
each scholar.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The British School</span>, a substantial
and commodious building in Arthur Street, was built by
subscription and a grant from the School Society.&nbsp; The
building is ornamented with stone quoins and cornices; the upper
room is occupied by the girls, and the lower room by the
boys.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Young Men&rsquo;s Institute</span> was
established in October, 1850, with the object of extending the
moral and intellectual culture of the young men of the town of
Oswestry.&nbsp; We are happy to observe that many of the young
men in the town have enrolled themselves as members, a library
has been established, and the news room is furnished with papers,
and some of the most popular periodicals of the day.&nbsp; The
ordinary members pay 1s. 6d. per quarter, honorary members pay an
annual subscription of 10s. 6d., or a donation of &pound;10 or
upwards.&nbsp; The corporation have kindly granted a room in the
Council Hall for the accommodation of the members.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Savings Bank</span>, in Bailey Square,
was established in 1818.&nbsp; The capital stock of the bank on
November 20th, 1850, amounted to &pound;50,973. 6s. 1d., at which
time there were 1463 separate accounts; of which 23 were
charitable societies, having deposits amounting to &pound;851.
8s. 10d., and 31 friendly societies, with deposits amounting to

that sum, and not exceeding &pound;100; 62 above &pound;100, and
less than &pound;150; 26 did not exceed &pound;200, and two
accounts were above that sum.&nbsp; The bank is open on
Wednesdays, from twelve to two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Thomas L.
Longueville, Esq., is treasurer, and Mr. John Hughes,
secretary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The House of Industry</span> is an
extensive range of building, composed of brick, pleasantly
situated about a mile from the town.&nbsp; It was erected by the
joint subscription of the town and parish of Oswestry, the
several parishes of Whittington, West Felton, St. Martin&rsquo;s,
Chirk, Selattyn, Knockin, Kinnerley, Ruyton, Llansilin,
Llanyblodwell, and the township of Llwytidman, in the parish of
Llanymynech.&nbsp; The house will accommodate 600 inmates; the
average number is about 190.&nbsp; It was built under
Gilbert&rsquo;s Act.&nbsp; The respective parishes appoint the
officers, who collect the rates, and pay the out-poor.&nbsp; The
board days are every Monday.&nbsp; Richard Nightingale Broughton,
Esq., is the chairman, Mr. John Hughes, clerk, Mr. Thomas Morris,
governor, Mr. Thomas Davies, relieving officer, and Edward and
Ann Jones, schoolteachers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Dispensary</span>, in Lower Brook
Street, under the superintendence of Mr. Hales, is supported by
annual subscriptions and donations.&nbsp; It is worthy of
increased support from the charitable and humane; for since its
establishment hundreds have partaken of the healing benefits of
this Samaritan institution, the object of which is to check, and
ameliorate suffering humanity, in whatever form it is found.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Town Hall</span> is situated near the
site of the Castle, and forms one side of the square called
Bailey-head.&nbsp; It is a plain stone building, comprising a
large room (where the sessions and public affairs of the town are
transacted) and offices for the clerks, &amp;c.&nbsp; The front
is enclosed by an iron palisade.&nbsp; Near the centre of the
building is a figure of King Oswald, carved in stone.&nbsp; At
the back of the hall is the police establishment, built in 1830,
and residence of Mr. Jacob Smith, clerk of the market and
superintendent of police.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Borough Gaol</span>, in Castle Fields,
is a brick structure, erected in 1826, which contains three cells
and two airing yards.&nbsp; It is now used as a lock-up, under
the control of the borough and county magistrates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Powis Market Hall</span> forms one
side of the spacious area of the Bailey Square, and is a plain
stone building, with a high clock turret.&nbsp; The front part of
the structure was formerly used as the Guild Hall, at the back of
which additional erections have been made of brick, chiefly
through the instrumentality of P. Cartwright, Esq., and a few
other resident gentlemen.&nbsp; It is a spacious structure,
partly covered with glass.&nbsp; Here the corn market is held on
Wednesdays, and is very numerously attended by the farmers in the
surrounding district.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Fairs</span> at Oswestry are held on
the first Wednesday in each month, for the sale of butter,
cheese, and other commodities, which take place in the Powis
Market Hall.&nbsp; The North Shropshire and North Wales yeomen
are justly proud of their fine dairies of cheese and butter, and
the market is unrivalled in Shropshire for the extent of business
that is transacted in these commodities.&nbsp; The day preceding
the above is for the sale of cattle, sheep, and pigs, which takes
place in the Smithfield Market.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Market</span> held on Wednesdays for
butter, poultry, and butchers&rsquo; meat, is very numerously
attended.&nbsp; The meat and provisions brought to the market are
abundant in quantity and excellent in quality.&nbsp; Considerable
quantities of poultry (geese, ducks, as well as the small Welsh
mutton) are brought here weekly for sale.&nbsp; The shambles are
in Willow Street and Bailey Street; and the butter and poultry
market is conveniently arranged and covered in.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Gas Works</span>, situated near
Gallows Tree Gate, on the Salop road, were established in
1842.&nbsp; The premises are conveniently arranged, and from 8s.
to 10s. are charged per 1,000 cubic feet for the luminous
vapour.&nbsp; Mr. Robert Roberts is the proprietor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Theatre</span>, a small building in
Willow Street, is usually open for a few weeks in the year by a
company of comedians.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Races</span> are held at Cen-y-bwch, a
beautiful piece of ground situated on an eminence to the west of
the town.&nbsp; The races of late years have not commanded that
attention and support which they formerly did, and they were
altogether discontinued last year.&nbsp; It is expected, however,
they will again take place during the present year about the
usual time, in the autumn of the year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Railway Station</span> is situated on
the north-east side of the town.&nbsp; There are ten trains
arrive and depart during the day to Gabowen, where the branch
from Oswestry joins the trunk line of the Shrewsbury and Chester
railway.&nbsp; Mr. E. Jones is the station-master.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Assembly Room</span> and <span
class="smcap">Bowling Green</span> are at the Wynstay Arms.&nbsp;
The <span class="smcap">Stamp Office</span> is in Willow
Street.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Excise Office</span> is at
the Cross Keys Inn.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The News
Room</span> is at the Court House, Bailey Square.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Cricket Ground</span> is in Lower Brook
Street.&nbsp; <i>The Oswestry Advertiser</i>, a small publication
which makes its appearance on the first Wednesday in each month,
is extensively patronised as an advertising medium, and is worthy
of support for the interesting local information which it
furnishes.&nbsp; Mr. John A. Roberts is the publisher and
proprietor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">The Free Grammar School</span> is pleasantly
situated on the west side of the town.&nbsp; It was founded as
early as the reign of Henry IV. by David Hobech, who granted, for
the maintenance of a schoolmaster, and the reparation of the
school-house there, certain lands in Sweeney, Treflach, Maesbury,
and Crickheath.&nbsp; By an inquisition, under a commission of
charitable uses, taken at Oswestry, and dated 10th April, 1634,
it is stated that although the bailiffs of Oswestry had the
ordering and disposing of the school and the school lands, they
had done the same without any just authority, and that <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>if they had
been trusted they had manifestly abused the trust, in making
leases at an under value and for secret rewards for
themselves.&nbsp; The said commissioners therefore decreed, that
the bailiffs of the said town should be for ever discharged and
excluded from any trust or intermeddling with the school lands,
that the schoolmaster for the time being should let the premises
in possession, and not in reversion, for the term of seven years,
with the consent of the bishop and chancellor of the
diocese.&nbsp; The commissioners further ordered that the
schoolmaster should have an usher, to be allowed &pound;10 a
year; and the master for the time being to keep the school
premises in repair.</p>
<p>The property now held by the master consists of 34<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 18<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land at Crickheath, let for &pound;30
per annum; three closes of land in Treflach, containing 23<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 7<span
class="smcap">p</span>., producing a yearly rental of &pound;36;
land in the township of Sweeney, containing altogether 68<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 10<span
class="smcap">p</span>., let for &pound;134 per annum.&nbsp;
There was also a small piece of land in Sweeney, of about half an
acre, of which the master had lost possession.&nbsp; It was
surrounded by property belonging to Sir W. W. Wynne, and had in
fact been sold by him.&nbsp; The master having established his
title thereto, a small piece of land adjoining the school
premises was given up to him in lieu thereof.&nbsp; Four closes
of land in Weston Cotton, containing 19<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 9<span
class="smcap">p</span>., producing &pound;40 per annum; and an
allotment in the same township of 1<span class="smcap">a</span>.
2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 9<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
let for &pound;3 yearly; land in the township of Maesbury
consisting of 16<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 18<span class="smcap">p</span>. producing
an annual sum of &pound;24; and the yearly sum of &pound;1. 6s.
8d. as a free farm rent, issuing out of a corn mill in
Maesbury.&nbsp; The rents of the above premises amount in the
whole to &pound;271. 10s. 2d., and are received by the master of
the school.&nbsp; In addition to the premises already noticed,
there is a school and school-house, and seven acres of land in
the town of Oswestry, held under lease from Sir W. W. Wynne,
bearing date 22nd September, 1815, for 10,000 years, at the clear
yearly rent of &pound;12.&nbsp; The school now existing was built
by Dr. Donne, the expenses of which amounted to about
&pound;1,400.&nbsp; The school is open to all boys born in the
parish of Oswestry, for instruction in English, Latin, and Greek;
but it is expected that they should be able to read before they
are admitted.&nbsp; No payment is demanded of the scholars,
except 7s. 6d. for entrance, and 2s. a-year for fire money.&nbsp;
The course of instruction in the school is chiefly classical; but
algebra, geometry, history, and writing are also taught.&nbsp;
For the latter a separate charge is made.&nbsp; In addition to
the scholars on the foundation, the master takes a limited number
of boarders.&nbsp; We cannot but observe on the inconveniences
that have occurred, and are likely to occur, for want of
trustees.&nbsp; It is true that Dr. Donne recovered possession of
a great part of the school property, or an equivalent for it, at
his own expense; but few persons in his situation would have
undertaken the same risk; and the necessity for such proceedings
was probably owing to the reluctance felt by former masters to
involving themselves in litigation with the tenants.&nbsp; The
Rev. Stephen Donne, M.A., is the head master.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Owen</i>, in 1713, left &pound;20 for the use of the
charity school.&nbsp; <i>Daniel Poole</i>, in 1716, left the
interest of &pound;20 for the same use.&nbsp; In 1737, &pound;32
was laid out on the poor house in Church street, which sum was
paid out of the above legacies; and it was ordered at a vestry
that a yearly sum of 40s. should be paid towards the support of
the charity school.&nbsp; Nothing, however, has been paid in
respect of these charities for many years.&nbsp; The poor house
in Church street has been sold, and the produce applied to the
general purposes of the town.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Almshouses</span>.&mdash;<i>Dame
Ellen</i>, widow of Sir Francis Eure, by will bearing date 20th
August, 1626, devised six tenements in William street, to the
bailiffs and burgesses of Oswestry, and their successors, to be
used and employed for the habitation of six poor men and six poor
women, to be appointed by the said bailiffs and their
successors.&nbsp; <i>Jane Owen</i>, in 1732, bequeathed to the
twelve poor persons, inmates of the almshouse commonly called
Porkington almshouses, the sum of 18s., to be paid to them yearly
for ever; and she ordered her executor to charge her real and
personal estate with the payment thereof.&nbsp; It does not
appear that this gift was ever in any way settled to the use of
the <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>almspeople, <i>Mrs. S. Ormsby</i>, by her will in 1805,
requested her daughter (now the wife of W. Ormsby Gore, Esq.),
and those who should succeed her in the Porkington estate, would
pay, &ldquo;as she had done,&rdquo; the poor people in the
almshouse for ever.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. Gore</i> distributes &pound;3
among the inmates on Christmas day, that being the sum her mother
had previously given.&nbsp; The almshouses are kept in repair by
Mrs. Gore, and she appoints the inmates.</p>
<p><i>Margaret Godolphin</i>, in 1748, gave a messuage and shop,
and other premises to the use of the vicar of Oswestry for the
time being, provided he should live in the said house; and if the
vicar should not reside in the said dwelling, the same should be
let yearly, and the rents paid to the churchwardens, to be
applied in placing out poor fatherless children
apprentices.&nbsp; The premises above were exchanged in the year
1823, for other premises situate in Brook street.&nbsp; Before
this exchange took place the house originally devised was not
occupied by the vicar, but was let by the overseers, and the rent
improperly carried to the general account of the poor&rsquo;s
rate.&nbsp; <i>Owen Morgan</i>, in 1604, gave certain property to
the Haberdashers&rsquo; Company, London, subject to the payment
of &pound;20 yearly, for the relief of the poor people of the
parish of Oswestry, to be distributed where most need should
appear, by the parson, curate, and the churchwardens of the said
parish.&nbsp; The yearly sum of &pound;20 is received from the
Haberdashers&rsquo; Company, through the Oswestry bank.&nbsp;
This forms part of a general fund, which is distributed as
hereafter mentioned.</p>
<p><i>Hugh Yale</i>, by his will bearing date 2nd January, 1605,
gave a messuage and garden adjoining the churchyard of Oswestry,
with a croft near the Chapel Fields, and the reversion of a house
and garden adjoining the school, in trust, to bestow the rents
among the necessitous poor of the town; and he directed that if
any preacher, lawfully licensed, should upon that day preach in
the Welsh tongue in the parish church of Oswestry, he should
receive 6s. 8d. out of the rents.&nbsp; The property belonging to
Yale&rsquo;s charity consists of a field called the Poor&rsquo;s
Croft, let for &pound;8 per annum; two small tenements in Upper
Brook street, producing a rental of &pound;5 yearly; two plots of
ground near the churchyard, demised to Richard Price for a term
of 99 years, from 1st May, 1809, at a yearly rent of &pound;2.
12s. 6d.; a piece of ground near the churchyard, let on lease in
1808 for a term of 99 years, to Thomas Davies, Esq., for 20s. per
annum; two small cottages adjoining the churchyard, one let for
&pound;2 a year, and the other for &pound;3 a year.&nbsp; A
garden, for which a yearly rent of 2s. 6d. from the year 1688
till 1825 was received, when the party holding it disputed the
right of the claim; the churchwardens, however, intended to take
proceedings for possession of the land.&nbsp; In 1782, 10s. is
entered as received of Thomas Griffith, for one year&rsquo;s rent
for a yard and a saw-pit adjoining the Lawn House.&nbsp; The same
rent was afterwards paid by the Rev. Mr. Maurice, and, in 1804,
by John Bonner, Esq., who succeeded to Mr. Maurice&rsquo;s
property.&nbsp; Nothing, however, has been paid since 1806, and
the piece of ground could not be satisfactorily identified when
the charity commissioners published their report.&nbsp; The
income of this charity is added to the general fund, disposed of
as hereafter mentioned.&nbsp; There seems to have been great
negligence in the management of this charity, in admitting
tenants who were unable to pay the rent; in not keeping up the
boundaries of the land; and in not preserving the counterparts of
those leases which appear to have been granted.</p>
<p><i>John Morris</i> gave an annual payment of &pound;1. 10s.,
issuing out of lands at Crickheath, for the use of the poor of
the town of Oswestry.&nbsp; The amount is paid by the agent of W.
Eyton, Esq., as the owner of the land upon which the payment is
charged.</p>
<p><i>Richard Witcherley</i> gave a parcel of land in Beatrice
street, and directed 1s. per week to be expended in bread out of
the rent thereof, and the overplus to be applied in apprentice
fees.&nbsp; The premises consist of a croft, containing 1<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>., let at a
yearly rent of &pound;7.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Dorothy Southey&rsquo;s Charity</i>.&mdash;A yearly
sum of &pound;2. 12s. is paid from a field in the liberties of
the town of Oswestry, as the gift of <i>Mrs. Southey</i>, for a
distribution of bread.</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span><i>William Gough</i>, in 1669, left a rent charge of
&pound;5. 6s. 8d., charged on certain lands in Trevlach, and
directed &pound;5 per annum to be applied in placing out poor
children apprentice, born in the parish of Oswestry, and the
remaining 6s. 8d. to be paid to the minister for a sermon on St.
Stephen&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>A donor unknown gave a small plot of land for the use of the
poor of Oswestry.&nbsp; A yearly payment of 5s. is made by
<i>William Ormsby Gore</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, out of a piece of land
near Llwyn gate, in respect of this charity.&nbsp; There is also
a yearly payment of 5s. issuing out of a house and premises in
Cross street, the property of D. O. Cooper, which is distributed
in bread among the poor.</p>
<p><i>Winifred Matthews</i>, in 1709, left a yearly sum of
&pound;2. 10s., payable out of a piece of land in Trefonen,
called Maes-y-Benglog, towards putting apprentice one poor child
of the town of Oswestry one year, and the next year from
Trefonon, Treflach, Sweeney, or Trever clawdd.&nbsp; The property
from which this payment is made belongs to Sir W. W. Wynne, and
the amount is paid by his agent.</p>
<p><i>Mary Lloyd</i>, in 1727, bequeathed &pound;100, and
directed the yearly interest thereof to be laid out in woollen
cloth for the poor of the town of Oswestry, and apprenticing a
poor boy of the said town alternately.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. Peacock</i>,
in 1732 gave &pound;5, the interest to be distributed among poor
decayed housekeepers.&nbsp; These two sums are laid out upon the
security of the tolls of the turnpike road leading from Oswestry
to Selattyn, called the Willow Gate Trust; and &pound;5. 5s. is
paid as the interest.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Turner</i>, by his will, 1777, bequeathed &pound;20,
the interest thereof to be distributed among the poor of the
parish of Oswestry.</p>
<p>The produce of the eleven charities last mentioned, amounting
to &pound;55. 11s., are brought to one account, kept by the
churchwardens appointed for the town of Oswestry, and disposed of
for the benefit of the poor of the town, exclusive of the rest of
the parish.&nbsp; Six shillings worth of bread is given away in
the church every alternate Sunday, and the residue is given away
at different times of the year, in bread, clothing, or shoes,
according to the discretion of the churchwardens for the time
being.&nbsp; As it appeared the churchwardens had frequently
selected for distribution such articles as they themselves dealt
in, the charity commissioners strongly recommended that some
regular mode of distributing these charities should be adopted,
and that the directions of the respective donors should be
followed as far as they could be ascertained, and circumstances
would admit.</p>
<p><i>Sir John Swinnerton</i>, by will 1616, charged his lands
with the payment of &pound;5. 4s. for bread, which, by the sale
of the lands, was increased to &pound;7. 4s. per annum.&nbsp; The
money for which the land was sold was in the hands of T.
Kynaston, Esq., nearly fifty years, and subsequently of Mr.
Lloyd, for which interest was regularly paid till 1781, when this
money was called in, for the purpose of enabling the town to
purchase and repair certain premises near the churchyard,
intended for a workhouse.&nbsp; The money was probably applied
accordingly; but in 1808 this workhouse was sold for &pound;280,
by the directors of the Oswestry house of industry, under the
powers of an act of parliament, passed 31 George III.&nbsp; We
are informed, however, that the produce of this sale was not
added to the funds of the house of industry, but was applied in
obtaining an act of parliament for lighting and paving the town
of Oswestry.&nbsp; It appears, therefore, the inhabitants of the
town of Oswestry have appropriated to their own use a sum of
&pound;120 applicable to charitable uses, without making the poor
any compensation in lieu thereof.</p>
<p><i>Richard Muckleston</i>, in 1638, gave 40s. per annum to be
distributed in bread to the poor of Oswestry, charged on premises
in the parish of Kilgurran, and at Llandrau.&nbsp; The amount is
expended in bread and distributed on Good Friday.</p>
<p><i>Francis Shore</i>, in 1691, charged his mansion house in
Oswestry, with the payment of 20s. yearly, to be distributed
among the poor.&nbsp; Mr. Jones, the owner of the house, gives
20s. yearly among poor persons, according to his own discretion,
on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span><i>Margaret Lloyd</i>, by will 1694, charged her house
and croft in the parish of Oswestry, with the annual payment of
20s., to be given among twenty poor labourers or decayed
tradesmen.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Williams</i>, in 1703, left to poor housekeepers
40s. per annum, to be distributed by the churchwardens on Palm
Monday, for ever, which money was to be paid out of the Mixen
Hall estate.</p>
<p><i>Rebecca Lloyd</i>, by will 1733, gave &pound;20, which was
afterwards secured on premises in Cross street.&nbsp; The amount
is paid by Mr. Penson, the owner of a house and garden in Cross
street, and distributed by the churchwardens among forty poor
persons on New Year&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p><i>Sir William Williams</i>, by his will, 7th September, 1734,
bequeathed &pound;200, the annual produce thereof to be
distributed among poor persons of the town and parish of
Oswestry.&nbsp; This money is in the hands of Sir Watkin W.
Wynne, whose agent pays the yearly sum of &pound;10 as the
interest thereof.&nbsp; One half of this money is distributed by
the churchwardens of the town, in sums of 6d. and 1s. each.&nbsp;
The other half is divided between the upper and lower divisions
of the parish.</p>
<p><i>Sir Nathaniel Lloyd&rsquo;s Charity</i>.&mdash;In the will
of Sir Nathaniel Lloyd, bearing date All Souls day, 1740, there
is the following clause:&mdash;&ldquo;I give to some of the
meaner inhabitants of Oswestry and Whittington a yearly benefit,
equally among them, as shall arise out of my South Sea Stock and
old annuities; the first putting in of such persons to be in the
heir of Aston, of the family of my grandfather, Andrew Lloyd,
Esq., and the nomination to any vacancy to be in the bishop of
that diocese and the heir of Aston alternately.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon
after the death of the testator, proceedings were instituted in
the Court of Chancery, and by a decree made 14th November, 1743,
it was referred to the master to inquire of what South Sea Stock
and Old South Sea annuities the testator died possessed; to
appoint trustees, to whose names the same should be transferred,
and to approve of a scheme for the application of the charity;
and it was declared that the bequest to the meaner inhabitants of
Oswestry and Whittington was a perpetual charity, and ought to be
distributed among the meaner inhabitants, who should not receive
alms.&nbsp; The master, by his report, made 15th May 1745,
certified that the testator was possessed of &pound;660. 16s. 9d.
South Sea Stock, and &pound;2,623. 16s. Old South Sea annuities;
and he approved of a scheme, whereby it was provided that the
charity should be extended to the whole town and liberty of
Oswestry; and that three-fifths of the dividends should be paid
among the meaner inhabitants, not receiving alms, and two-fifths
among the like persons in Whittington; and that twelve persons of
the town and liberty of Oswestry, and eight persons of
Whittington, be nominated alternately by the heir of Aston, and
the bishop of St. Asaph, should be allowed &pound;4 each yearly,
by quarterly payments.&nbsp; That a power should be vested in
seven trustees thereinafter named, to make orders for the better
management of the charity; and that on the death of any of the
trustees, the survivors should within six weeks appoint
another.&nbsp; The master&rsquo;s report was confirmed, and the
stock and annuities duly transferred into their names.&nbsp; The
dividends, amounting to &pound;97 19s. 8d. per annum, are
received by Messrs. Child, and &pound;50 is transmitted every
Christmas, and &pound;45 every Midsummer, to Mr. Lloyd, who pays
to twenty poor persons of the parishes of Oswestry and
Whittington, &pound;4. 10s. per annum, by half-yearly
payments.&nbsp; No persons are appointed unless at the time they
reside in one of the parishes above mentioned; but if they
afterwards cease to reside there, the allowance is not taken away
from them.&nbsp; The parties receiving the charity are generally
such as have been reduced from better circumstances.</p>

poor.&nbsp; The same property is considered as charged with 6s.
8d. yearly for a sermon in the Welsh language, but the payment
has not been made of late years, no sermon having been preached
at Sweeney in Welsh.</p>

<h3>SELATTYN</h3>
<p>is a parish on the N.W. verge of the county, bordering on
Shropshire, comprising the townships of Upper and Lower
Porkington, and containing 5,437 acres of land.&nbsp; In 1801 the
parish embraced a population of 701 souls; in 1831, 1,143; and in
1841 there were 241 houses and 1,128 inhabitants, of whom 556
were males, and 572 females.&nbsp; The village of Selattyn lies
on an acclivity, three miles N.N.W. from Oswestry, and consists
of a few detached houses near to the church.&nbsp; The rest of
the population reside in dwellings which are scattered throughout
the parish.&nbsp; To the north and west of the village, a bleak
and mountainous district stretches to the extremity of the
county.&nbsp; The principal landowners are William Ormsby Gore,
Esq., M.P.; Thos. George Warrington Carew, Esq.; John Wynn Eyton,
Esq.; John Povey, Esq.; Richard Henry Kinchant, Esq.; Mrs. Lloyd;
Richard Lewis, Esq.; Thos. Jones, Esq.; Thomas Lovett, Esq.; Mr.
John Williams; Mr. John Edwards; Mr. Richard Jones; Messrs.
Gilpin and Owen; and the trustees of Shrewsbury Grammar School;
besides whom are several other proprietors.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a plain cruciform
structure, with a square tower, and is dedicated to St.
Mary.&nbsp; A small organ was added in 1847, at a cost of
&pound;70.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Edwards, who died in the year
1800, is remembered on a neat tablet.&nbsp; The living is a
rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;12. 9s. 7d.,
in the patronage of Mrs. Lloyd, and enjoyed by the Rev. Albany
Rosendale Lloyd, M.A.&nbsp; The tithes were commuted in 1840 for
&pound;813.&nbsp; James Wildig, one of the assembly of divines,
and the Rev. Henry Sacheverall, D.D., remarkable for their
different principles, were rectors of Selattyn.&nbsp; A <span
class="smcap">Chapel of Ease</span>, dedicated to St. Barnabas,
was opened for divine service on June 11th, 1850, at
Hengoed.&nbsp; It is a small edifice, in the early English style,
with nave and chancel, and has a chaste and neat
appearance.&nbsp; The cost of the structure was about &pound;500,
which was <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>raised by subscription, to which the rector was a
liberal contributor.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Lewis Lewis is the
officiating minister.&nbsp; Previous to the erection of this
chapel there was a small place of worship here, which has since
been converted into a school, where about fifty children are
educated.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Free</span> or <span
class="smcap">Parochial School</span> is situated a short
distance from the parish church, where about 100 boys are
educated.&nbsp; There is also a girls&rsquo; school, where 40
children are instructed.&nbsp; Mr. William Cullis, the teacher,
is writing master to the juvenile branches of the royal family,
and has published a small school book, which has had a large
circulation.&nbsp; (For the endowment, see
&ldquo;<i>Charities</i>.&rdquo;)&nbsp; The village is supplied
with an abundance of excellent water, by means of a <i>Water Ram
Fountain</i>, which was placed on the road side, at the sole
expense of the rector, in the year 1847.&nbsp; The water is
brought from a distance of about 1,000 feet, and rises 100 feet
in perpendicular height.&nbsp; There are lime works on the
western verge of the parish.&nbsp; About half a mile W. by N.
from the church is a tower, upon the lofty summit of a hill,
which is a conspicuous object for many miles.&nbsp; It was built
by the Rev. Gerald Carew, and has the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GORSEDD ORWYNION</span>.<br />
It is recorded in the poems of the aged Prince and Bard,
Llywarch-hen,<br />
that in the 7th century, from<br />
this spot he saw his son Gwen slain in a battle<br />
between the Britons and Saxons, on the brook Morlas below.<br />
Oedd gwr-vy-m&acirc;b oedd ddysgywen hawl<br />

</blockquote>
<p>A sepulchral urn, containing bones, was found underneath this
tower, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1847.</p>
<p>From the tower a most beautiful panoramic view of the fertile
plains of Shropshire is seen towards the south-east, and in the
opposite direction the bold and picturesque scenery of the
counties of Denbigh and Montgomery open to view.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Porkington</span>, the seat of William Ormsby Gore,
Esq., M.P., lies about a mile N.W. from Oswestry.&nbsp; This
plane takes its name from <i>Brogyntyn</i>, an old castle of the
Welsh princes, which stood in the neighbouring grounds, and was
surrounded by a deep fosse, which may still be traced.&nbsp;
Porkington is a Grecian edifice, with an elegant portico.&nbsp;
The park is extensive, and has a fine undulating surface, richly
adorned with timber, and the prospects are extensive, varied, and
beautiful.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Pentre-pant Hall</span> is a
handsome residence, in a sequestered situation about two miles
south from Selattyn; the hall is elegantly furnished, and the
grounds beautifully wooded.&nbsp; It is the property of Thomas
George Warrington Carew, Esq., and residence of the Rev. Gerald
Carew.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Derwen</span> is a neat
house, S.E. from Selattyn, the residence and property of John
Povey, Esq.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Rectory</span> is a
pleasantly situated house, a little south from the church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>John
Hanmer</i>, D.D., bishop of St. Asaph, by will, 1628, gave the
inheritance and fee-simple of his tenement in Selattyn to the use
of the poor of the parish.</p>
<p><i>Charles Morris</i>, in 1721, bequeathed &pound;500 in
trust, and directed the amount to be laid out in the purchase of
lands, and out of the yearly proceeds thereof 20s. to be paid
yearly for a sermon on Candlemas-day, and the residue to be
employed for the maintenance of the poor charity children and
other poor persons of this parish.&nbsp; The legacy was laid out
in the purchase of land soon after the death of the testator, but
there are no title deeds now to be found in the parish relating
thereto, and that it is so intermixed with the property devised
by Bishop Hanmer that it would now be difficult to distinguish
them.&nbsp; The whole estate consists of 53<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>., including
18 acres of allotment, and about one rood of ground, obtained by
exchange with Mr. John Edwards.&nbsp; The estate produces
&pound;60. 5s. per annum, to which is added 4s. yearly, the
moiety of rent due to this parish from certain land left by J. R.
Powell.&nbsp; There is a school and school-house on the premises,
devised by Bishop Hanmer, the former of which was built in
1812.&nbsp; The Rev. G. N. K. Lloyd, the rector, contributed
&pound;100 towards this building, on condition that he, <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>and the
successors to his property in this parish, should have the
privilege of sending to the school six poor children resident in,
though not belonging to, the parish, to be taught free.&nbsp; The
school at Hengoed was built upon land given by G. H. Carew, Esq.,
principally at the expense of the rector, who gave &pound;200,
expressly upon the condition that the children of all poor
residents in the parish should be admitted to both the
schools.</p>
<p><i>Colonel Owen</i> charged certain lands, which now form part
of the Porkington estate, with the payment of &pound;6 yearly to
the poor of this parish.&nbsp; A yearly sum of &pound;10 is now
paid by Mrs. Gore to the rector, who distributes the amount in
sums varying from 5s. to 10s.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Margaret Ormsby</i>, by her will, dated 25th February,
1805, requested those who should succeed her in the Porkington
estate, to distribute &pound;20 annually among poor persons in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; In compliance with this request, the
daughter of the testatrix gives &pound;20 yearly among the most
deserving poor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Nursery</span> is the elegant seat of
John Freeman Milward Dovaston, Esq., barrister, a gentleman of
classical learning, high genius, ardent benevolence, and indeed
possessed of every estimable quality which adorns the mind.&nbsp;
It is deeply to be regretted that Mr. Dovaston has not been able
to leave his bed for several years.&nbsp; It may be said that he
has inherited the virtues of his father, John Dovaston, Esq., a
gentleman of learning, science, and ingenuity, who died March
31st, 1808.&nbsp; He was born of humble parents, who lived on
their small estate at West Felton.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was taught to
read by an old woman in the village, and that was the whole of
his education; every other acquirement which he afterwards
possessed in so eminent a degree was entirely his own.&nbsp; He
was the eldest son of seven, all of whom he brought up to
respectable professions.&nbsp; From his father he received his
little estate, swallowed up by mortgages, which he redeemed at a
very early period of life, by two voyages to the West Indies, and
afterwards considerably increased by prudence and industry.&nbsp;
Though he left scarcely any <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>science untouched, his turn of mind
was principally directed to antiquities, natural philosophy,
music, mechanics, and planting; of the first he left a large
collection of manuscripts, historical observations relating to
Shropshire and the Welsh borders; on druidical relics, tracing
traditional vulgar errors from the remote times of
superstition.&nbsp; In mechanics he left a set of philosophical
and musical instruments made by his own hands, and just before
his death he projected an orrery to show the satellites on a new
method.&nbsp; In planting he has clothed the country around him
with forest and fruit trees, all raised and grafted with his own
hands; and his villa (which from his fondness for planting he
called &ldquo;The Nursery&rdquo;), is laid out with much taste
and rural elegance.&nbsp; He was well versed in the Hebrew,
Anglo-Saxon, and Latin tongues, and had some knowledge of
Greek.&nbsp; His reading was very extensive, his mind vigorous,
and his application intense.&nbsp; He was remarked for the
plainness of his dress, yet his person always appeared dignified,
and his manners were courteous and gentlemanly.&nbsp; He was fond
of a cheerful glass, remarkably communicative and sociable, full
of facetious anecdote, which he had a singularly agreeable manner
of imparting.&nbsp; To the very last day of his life he rose at
five, it being one of his maxims always to get start of the
sun.&nbsp; Though he lived to the age of 68 years, it was the
opinion of his medical friends that his excessive and laborious
application of mind and body brought a somewhat premature
decay.&nbsp; In his youth he was the close friend of Shenstone,
to whose memory he was always much attached.&nbsp; On his death
bed he spoke to his son these remarkable
words:&mdash;&lsquo;Jack, I believe in my soul it has pleased God
to prosper all my undertakings; my lad, be honest, and you will
be independent; be liberal, and you will be esteemed; deserve
God&rsquo;s blessing, and you will be happy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

207</span>WHITTINGTON</h3>
<p>is a parish and village, pleasantly situated on the turnpike
road from Oswestry to Ellesmere, two miles and a half E.E. by N.
from the former town, and sixteen miles N.N. by W. by railway
from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The parish comprises the townships of
Berghill, Daywell, Ebnall, Fernhill, Frankton, Henlle, Hindford,
Old Marton, and Whittington, which, together, in 1801 contained a
population of 1,398 souls; 1831, 1,788; and in 1841, 1,919.&nbsp;
The tithes of the whole parish are commuted for
&pound;1,000.&nbsp; The township of Whittington, in 1841,
contained 164 houses and 808 inhabitants.&nbsp; The principal
landowners are Edmund Wright, Esq.; Mrs. Lloyd; Richard Henry
Kinchant, Esq.; William Ormsby Gore, Esq., M.P.; Thomas Lovett,

<span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a plain brick fabric,
rebuilt in 1806, at a cost of &pound;1,500.&nbsp; The exterior is
partially covered with inscriptions from the Holy Bible.&nbsp;
The original fabric was of stone, and is said to have been built
by the first Fulk Fitz Warine, out of the refuse of the materials
when the castle was built.&nbsp; A commission was directed from
the council in the Marches of Wales, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1630, to John Trevor and Richard
Lloyd, gentlemen, to make a terrier of the glebe land of this
church, as also to return an inventory of the utensils belonging
to the same, amongst which there were three pairs of armour,
furnished with two pikes and two head pieces.&nbsp; These are
supposed to have been employed by the rector for the defence of
the castle against the Welsh.&nbsp; The living is a rectory,
valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;25. 4s. 2d., now
returned at &pound;1,224, in the patronage of Mrs. Lloyd, who is
also lady of the manor.&nbsp; Incumbent, Rev. Charles Arthur
Albany Lloyd, M.A.&nbsp; There are 58<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of glebe land in this township.</p>
<p>The chief object of attraction at Whittington are the ruins of
<span class="smcap">The Castle</span>.&nbsp; It is supposed to
have been built in the year 843, by a British nobleman, who was
succeeded by his son, Tudor Trevor, who, though possessed of many
houses with rich and extensive domains, made this his chief
residence.&nbsp; The descendants of Tudor continued possessed of
the castle for several generations, and many families in this
neighbourhood and North Wales boast their origin from him.&nbsp;
At the Domesday survey this place is called <i>Wititone</i>, and
consisted at that time of eight corn farms, twelve ox-stalls, and
a very extensive wood; the cows yielding five shillings per
annum, and all Welsh residents were obliged to pay twenty
shillings among them.&nbsp; The Castle of Whittington next passed
into the hands of Hugh, and afterwards of his brother Robert,
sons of the Earl of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Upon the defeat of Robert
by Henry I. it was restored to the Peverels.&nbsp; William de
Peverel had two daughters, the younger of whom was named Mellet,
and being a valiant knight himself resolved to marry his daughter
Mellet to none but a knight of consummate valour.&nbsp; Her
father promised the Castle of Whittington as her dower.&nbsp;
Several distinguished combatants assembled at Peverel&rsquo;s
Castle, in the Peak of Derbyshire, to contend for the fair
prize.&nbsp; When Guarine de Metz, then Lord of Aldberbury, went
there, and fighting with a son of the king of Scotland, and a
Baron of Burgoine, overthrew his rivals, and obtained the
beautiful Mellet.&nbsp; The posterity of this great man, for nine
generations, assumed the Christian name of Fulk.&nbsp; They
continued possessed of the castle from the end of the reign of
Henry I. till the time of Henry VIII., a period of nearly four
hundred years.&nbsp; On the rebellion of the barons against King
John, Fulk joined with them, for we find his name among the
number that were excommunicated by the Pope for extorting from
John that firm basis of English liberty called <span
class="smcap">Magna Charta</span>.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry
III., Fitz Guarine procured a grant of his estates to him and his
heirs for ever; for which he gave the king two coursers and two
hundred and sixty-two pounds,&mdash;an enormous sum in that age,
and gives some idea of the wealth of Fitz Guarine.&nbsp; The same
monarch granted him the liberty of a fair on St. Luke&rsquo;s
day, and a market on Wednesday, at Whittington; but on account of
its proximity to Ellesmere and Oswestry, both market and fair
have long been obsolete.&nbsp; Subsequently fairs were held on
the last Thursday in April, July and November, but these have
also been discontinued.&nbsp; <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>After the castle passed into the
hands of Henry VIII. we hear nothing further respecting it till
the following reign, when the king presented it to Henry Grey,
Duke of Suffolk, who forfeited it in consequence of being
convicted of high treason.&nbsp; Shortly after, Queen Mary
granted the castle to Fitz Alan, the last Earl of Arundel.&nbsp;
He mortgaged it to several persons, who obtained the place in
default of payment from him.&nbsp; William Albany, a chief man
among the number, was, by the joint consent and approbation of
the rest, put into sole possession of it.&nbsp; By the marriage
of his great granddaughter with Thomas Lloyd, Esq., of Aston,
Whittington passed into the hands of that family, and is now the
property of Mrs. Lloyd.&nbsp; The castle was fortified with five
round towers, each forty feet in diameter, and a hundred feet in
height, and the walls were twelve feet in thickness.&nbsp; It was
surrounded by a moat, part of which still remains, and the fosses
and intrenchments may yet be traced to a considerable
distance.&nbsp; About the year 1760, the eastern tower fell into
the moat; and some years afterwards one of the northern towers
and the western wall were taken down to repair the roads leading
from Whittington to Halston-bridge.&nbsp; The towers of the
gate-house are still entire; and some portions of the ancient
building have been modernised, and converted into a dwelling,
which is inhabited by Thomas Broughall, Esq.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Free School</span> is endowed with a
farm and two cottages, producing about &pound;47 per annum.&nbsp;
The school is taught in the Old Tithe Barn, a long brick building
of considerable antiquity; about 90 children attend.&nbsp; There
is also a girls&rsquo; school, where about 60 scholars
attend.&nbsp; The rector is a liberal contributor towards the
support of the schools.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Independents</span> have a small chapel here, built in
1844.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Brabins Wood</span> consists of a
number of cottages and a Primitive Methodist chapel, about a mile
S.E. from the church.&nbsp; The Shrewsbury and Chester Railway
Company have a station about a quarter of a mile west from the
church.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Park Hall</span>, an ancient
mansion with projecting gables, chiefly composed of timber, and
situated near the Oswestry road, about one mile and a quarter W.
from Whittington, is the residence and property of Richard Henry
Kinchant, Esq.&nbsp; The entrance hall is wainscotted, ornamented
with paintings, banners, &amp;c., and contains a massive oak
table, cut from one plank, measuring 23 feet long, 4 feet wide,
and 2&frac12; inches thick.&nbsp; Several of the apartments
contain antique oak furniture elaborately carved, and the
ceilings are of curious workmanship.&nbsp; There are also some
fine paintings, chiefly family portraits.&nbsp; On the west side
of the hall is the domestic chapel, which was probably erected in
the time of Henry VIII.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Robert
Jones</i>, in 1679, devised all his lands and houses in
Whittington, for the support of an &ldquo;honest ingenious
schoolmaster.&rdquo;&nbsp; The premises consist of 5<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 28<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and two dwelling houses built
thereon.&nbsp; The land is stated to be worth about &pound;11 per
annum.</p>
<p><i>Griffith Hughes</i>, in 1706, devised certain lands and a
dwelling house, at Rhuabon, and directed out of the yearly
proceeds 20s. to be paid for teaching poor children to read, in
Aston township, and the residue of the rents and profits to be
appropriated for educational purposes in Whittington and
Rhuabon.&nbsp; The estate islet for &pound;28 per annum.&nbsp; In
1813, a sum of &pound;142, the produce of some timber cut and
sold from the estate, was laid out in the purchase of a piece of
land in Whittington, containing 2<span class="smcap">a</span>.
1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 15<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
which produces a yearly sum of &pound;5.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth ap Robert</i>, in 1675, devised two pieces of
land in Pentrewerne, containing 7<span class="smcap">a</span>.
1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 18<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
for the benefit of the poor of this parish.&nbsp; The rents were
formerly applied in apprenticing children, but for some time they
have been paid to the mistress of the girls&rsquo; school in
Whittington.&nbsp; In the year 1822, a sum of &pound;146 was laid
out in the purchase of 1<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 16<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
in the township of Whittington.&nbsp; Of this sum, &pound;5 was a
legacy left to the poor by Richard Evans; &pound;15 was the
produce of timber cut and sold from the lands belonging to
Trustan&rsquo;s charity; &pound;31. 16s. was money which had been
paid for the property tax for several of the charity estates, but
which was returned, and <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>the residue was made up by the
rector.&nbsp; The land is let for &pound;5 per annum, which is
paid to the schoolmistress.</p>
<p><i>John Trustan</i>, in 1659, gave certain lands, and directed
the yearly proceeds to be expended in bread, and distributed
every Sabbath day for ever.&nbsp; The land devised, in eluding an
allotment awarded in 1781, consists of 11<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 36<span
class="smcap">p</span>., and is let at a yearly rent of
&pound;12.</p>
<p><i>Walter Rogers</i>, in 1685, left a rent charge of 40s. per
annum, issuing out of land called Bryn Rhig.&nbsp; The amount is
expended in flannel, and given away on St. Thomas&rsquo;s
day.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Lloyd</i>, by will, 1696, bequeathed &pound;200
to be laid out in the purchase of land, the yearly rent to be
divided among twelve of the poorest families of the township of
Whittington.&nbsp; It appears this sum was placed out at
interest, and the principal and interest in 1837 amounted to
&pound;350, which sum was laid out in the purchasing of a rent
charge of &pound;14 per annum, issuing out of a farm in
Whittington.</p>
<p><i>Robert Conway</i>, in 1727, charged his lands in the parish
of St. Martin with the payment of 20s. yearly, for the benefit of
the poor of Whittington parish.&nbsp; The particulars of Sir
Nathaniel Lloyd&rsquo;s charity will be found noticed with
Oswestry.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frances</i> has recently left &pound;200, the interest
to be divided among six poor widows of Whittington and Dudleston
in equal proportions.&nbsp; The amount is invested in the three
per cent. stock.</p>

Joseph Bickerton, Mr. John Gardener, and Mr. Robins.&nbsp; The
celebrated Watts Dyke makes its appearance at Gabowen in this
township, and may be traced from thence into the parish of St.
Martin.&nbsp; The extent between this dyke and Dyke Offa&rsquo;s,
which crosses the hills above Selattyn, is about four
miles.&nbsp; The intervening space between these dykes is said to
have been a common mart, where the English and Welsh met to carry
on commercial intercourse with each other; but if either party
transgressed these bounds, they were exposed to the severities of
war.&nbsp; Upon Watts Dyke at a place called Bryna Castle, near
to Gabowen, is the site of an old <i>Watchfort</i>, and another a
little further on towards St. Martin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <span

at Old Marton Hall, was one of the many instances in which
integrity and perseverance <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>have introduced their votaries to
ease and affluence.&nbsp; His father dying when he was only
twelve years old, and his mother marrying again, he was subjected
to the most unmerciful and cruel treatment of a
step-father.&nbsp; Having endured his unmerited sufferings for
several years, he bade adieu to his unpropitious home, and
arrived in London in March, 1748, where he soon found protectors
in Mr. Nourse and Mr. Manley, the latter of whom he succeeded in
business as a bookseller, where he soon found himself supported
by a numerous and respectable set of friends, and eventually rose
to wealth and affluence.&nbsp; To do good was his delight; to
communicate happiness to all around him was his unceasing
aim.&nbsp; He died in 1807, and left two sons and three
daughters.</p>

Burrows, and Amelia Jones.</p>

<h3>BASCHURCH</h3>
<p>is a respectable village, pleasantly situated about half a
mile west of the Baschurch railway station, and eight miles N.W.
from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The parish contains the several townships
of Baschurch, Birch, Boreatton, Eyton, Fennemere, Merehouse,
Newtown, Prescott, Stanwardine-in-the-Fields,
Stanwardine-in-the-Wood, Walford, Weston and Yeaton, which
together have an area of 10,758 acres of land.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;11,470. 11s. 6d.&nbsp; Population in 1801, 1,059;
in 1831, 1,321; and in 1841, 1,491.&nbsp; Baschuch is a place of
great antiquity.&nbsp; Cynddylan, the British prince, slain at
Whittington by the Saxons, about the year 570, was interred
here.&nbsp; The parish church is one of the eighteen churches
found in the county at the Doomsday survey, at which time
Baschurch was the head of a hundred.&nbsp; About a mile from the
village is a remarkable British fortress, or hold, the remains of
which are very distinct, and an object of great attraction to the
antiquary.&nbsp; It consists of two positions, one a natural
eminence about forty-five feet high, surrounded at the bottom by
a circular vallum; the other an elliptical <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>entrenchment, on which more pains have been bestowed,
very much lower than the other, and perfect on three sides, the
fourth being open, and apparently extended into a wider and more
irregular form.&nbsp; The vallum of this elliptical entrenchment,
where it faces the eminence described above, is thrice the height
of any other part of it.&nbsp; These two positions are
surrounded, on one side by a deep pool, on the other sides by an
extensive tract of black peaty soil, which was probably at an
early period covered with water.&nbsp; The works are connected by
a low road, made, by incredible labour, of small stones heaped
together; and both are connected with the main land by a similar
road leading across the morass in a curve.&nbsp; If this road was
covered with water, as probably it was to the depth of a few
inches, strangers would not know where it was; and the loftier
fortress had a farther defence in an interruption of the roads,
which do not reach all the way to it, but cease within a few feet
of the point of juncture, and thus act as a kind of rude
draw-bridge, where those in the fortress might lay down a plank
for those without to pass over.&nbsp; At the point where this
interruption of the road exists, was evidently the road into the
fort, which is there defended by two outworks; one on each
side.&nbsp; It was in this fastness that Cynddylan, imitating his
aboriginal forefathers, who fortified themselves in woods and
marshes, sought an asylum after his expulsion from Pengwern
(Shrewsbury).&nbsp; No reason can be assigned why he should be
buried at Baschurch, but that his residence was in the immediate
vicinity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is an ancient structure,
dedicated to All Saints, and consists of nave, chancel, and side
aisles, with a square tower, in which are four bells.&nbsp; There
is a gallery at the west end, upon which is a fine-toned
organ.&nbsp; The south side of the church was built about the
year 1615, and the north side in the year 1790.&nbsp; It contains
several handsome tablets and memorials to some of the principal
families in the neighbourhood; one of which, a handsome pyramidal
monument of elegant and costly workmanship, executed in marble,
records the death of William Basnett, Esq., of London, a native
of Baschurch, whose nephew and adopted heir, William Birch,
assumed the name of Basnett.&nbsp; Another memorial remembers
Rowland Hunt, Esq., and there are others to the Preslands,
Slaneys, Mucklestons, and Corbets.&nbsp; There is an ancient
Bible chained to the reading desk.&nbsp; The living is a
vicarage, valued in the King&rsquo;s book at &pound;10. 16s., in
the patronage of the Lord Chancellor, and enjoyed by the Rev.
William Jones.&nbsp; The church stands on the site of a former
edifice, which was burnt down in the year 1404.&nbsp; Divine
service was performed in the Manor House, at Walford, till a new
church was built.&nbsp; A stone in the churchyard remembers
William Green, who died at the age of ninety years; and about
fifteen years ago Mrs. Jones Hill Green died at the age of
ninety-nine years.&nbsp; The tithes were commuted in 1844 for
&pound;285.&nbsp; The vicarage is a good residence, pleasantly
situated, and stands a little east from the church.&nbsp; It has
been considerably improved by the present incumbent</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Newtown</span> may be considered to form a
part of Baschurch.&nbsp; It is a separate township, situated
between the railway station and the village, the Shrewsbury and
Chester railway intersecting the eastern side of the
township.&nbsp; In 1841 here were 25 houses and 131
inhabitants.&nbsp; There are two neat and capacious schools at
Newtown, and a preparatory school at Weston, supported from the
funds of Mrs. Harris&rsquo;s charity.&nbsp; In consequence of the
advantages of gratuitous education, the village is constantly
improving.&nbsp; The salubrity of the air, the facilities of
railway communication, and the general order and quiet
retirement, render it a desirable place for the erection of villa
residences.&nbsp; A commodious inn has recently been built at the
railway station, which is conducted by Mr. Thomas
Wilkinson.&nbsp; A market has been established on Friday, for the
sale of corn, butter, and poultry, which is held near the railway
station.&nbsp; There is a bowling green at the Admiral Duncan,
and a female benefit society, which is well supported.&nbsp;
Rowland Hunt, Esq., is lord of the manor.&nbsp; The principal
landowners are the lord of the manor; the Rev. William Jones;
Robert A. Slaney, Esq., M.P.; Richard Edwards, Esq.; Frederick <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Edwards,
Esq.; Edward Edwards, Esq.; William Sparling, Esq.; Mary
Pickstock; and others are also proprietors.&nbsp; The soil is a
mixture of gravel and loam, highly productive, and about one half
may be considerable arable.&nbsp; The river Perry divides
Baschurch from Ruyton, and skirts Boreatton Park.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Eleanor
Harris</i>, by will, bearing date 17th May, 1709, devised certain
land and tenements, at Stanwardine-in-the-Fields, in trust, to
pay certain annuities therein mentioned, and to dispose of the
residue for the providing of schooling for the boys and girls of
such of the lowest rank of inhabitants within the parish of
Baschurch as should not be able to give them a proper schooling;
and she directed that such children should be taught to read and
spell well, and to write fair hands and cast accounts, so as to
fit the boys for ordinary trades; and that when the profits of
the trust estate should be sufficient her trustees should apply a
reasonable part thereof for putting out the boys apprentices, and
for providing portions for the girls, to be given them on
marriage; and she further directed that her trustees should pay
yearly 20s. to the officiating minister of the parish for a
sermon in the church, on the afternoon of the Sunday next after
the anniversary of her death, at which time she desired such
minister to declare publicly the principal directions of her
will, to the intent that the same might never be concealed or
suppressed; and that the trustees should lay out 20s. for a
dinner for themselves.&nbsp; The property belonging this charity
consists of 267<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 36<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land
and certain houses, besides 7<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 31<span class="smcap">p</span>., which
was planted about fifty years ago with oaks, and the school
premises, consisting of 1<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 32<span class="smcap">p</span>., at
Newtown.&nbsp; When the Charity Commissioners published their
report the yearly income amounted to &pound;323. 10s.&nbsp; The
boys are taught reading, writing, and accounts, and the girls
reading and needlework.&nbsp; They are all supplied with every
article of clothing, except linen, once a year, and with books
and all school requisites; and they are permitted to remain in
the school till they are of sufficient age to go out to service,
or to be bound apprentice.&nbsp; When the children go out to
service they receive a complete suit of clothing, and a Bible and
a Prayer Book; and if they continue in the same place with credit
for five years, they receive a gratuity of &pound;3; and if for
seven years, &pound;5.&nbsp; In this respect no difference is
made between the boys and girls.&nbsp; The boys are occasionally
placed out apprentice, with a premium of &pound;6 each.&nbsp;
Nothing is paid out of the fund for marriage portions.&nbsp;
There is also a dame school supported out of the funds, for
teaching the younger children of poor persons residing at
Weston.&nbsp; The present trustees are R. A. Slaney, Esq., M.P.;
William Matthews, Esq.; Richard Wall, Esq.; and Mr. John
Jebb.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Baker</i>, in 1839, gave a rent charge of &pound;4
per annum, to be expended in bread, and given to the poor of the
parish on Sundays for ever.</p>
<p><i>Edward Tomkies</i>, by will, in 1771, bequeathed to the
poor of the parish of Baschurch &pound;100.&nbsp; The interest to
be laid out in sixpenny loaves of good bread, and given to the
poor over and above their usual allowance on Christmas days and
Easter Sundays.</p>
<p><i>Richard Wilkins</i> gave &pound;20, the interest to be
distributed by the vicar and churchwardens to such poor people as
should not receive relief.</p>
<p><i>Rev. John Barnet</i> gave &pound;20, and directed the
interest to be distributed to the poor.</p>
<p>A yearly sum of &pound;4. 11s. 2d. is paid to a schoolmaster,
as the interest of &pound;114 in the hands of R. Hunt, Esq.&nbsp;
It does not appear from whose benefaction this money was derived;
but it appears it was formerly laid out on turnpike security,
with &pound;130 belonging to two other charities, making
altogether &pound;244; which sum was afterwards placed in the
hands of R. Hunt, Esq.</p>
<p><i>Sarah Atcherley</i> gave &pound;30 to the poor, the
interest to be given in bread on Christmas days.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Presland</i>, in 1779, gave &pound;20, the interest
to be distributed yearly to poor distressed housekeepers.</p>

<p>Ellesmere, formerly written Aelsmere, is a place of
considerable antiquity, and derives it name from a fine sheet of
water or mere on the east side of the town, which covers one
hundred and sixteen acres.&nbsp; Leland describes the town in his
day as having four streets, while Camden speaks of it, &ldquo;as
a small tract of rich fertile ground, together with a small
castle, which King John settled on Llewellyn, Prince of North
Wales, when he made up the match between him and Joan, his
natural daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The town now contains several
respectable inns, and many good houses and shops, in all the
different branches of the retail trade.&nbsp; The malting
business is extensively carried on.&nbsp; Mr. John
Frumston&rsquo;s is one of the largest establishments in the
county.&nbsp; The cultivation of barley being particularly
attended to in the neighbouring country, causes the farmers
usually to attend the market here, which is held on
Tuesday.&nbsp; Fairs are held on the first Tuesday after February
2nd, third Tuesday in April, Whit Tuesday, first Tuesday in July,
last Tuesday in August, and the third Tuesday in October and
November for horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs.&nbsp; The castle of
Ellesmere stood on an artificial mount, near to the church.&nbsp;
<a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>At the
present time there are no vestiges of it to be seen, the top of
the mount being formed into a bowling green, which is kept in
admirable order, and supported by the gentry and tradesmen of the
town.&nbsp; From this eminence a most extensive and delightful
panoramic view of the fertile plains of Shropshire is seen; the
fine mere and the beautiful residence of C. K. Mainwaring, Esq.,
are charming objects in the vicinity.&nbsp; History is silent as
to the time and by whom the castle was built.&nbsp; In the 6th of
King John, the king gave the castle and manor of Ellesmere in
marriage with his daughter Joan to Llewellyn, Prince of North
Wales; in the 10th of that reign Bartholomew Turve, the governor,
he having turned his arms against the English, was commanded upon
his allegiance to put the place into the possession of William,
Earl of Shrewsbury, the king&rsquo;s natural brother, and Thomas
de Edginton.&nbsp; In the 4th of Henry III., Roger
L&rsquo;Estrange held this castle, and it continued to his
successors for a long period.&nbsp; In the 25th of Henry III.,
David, son of Llewellyn, late Prince of Wales, by his charter,
surrendered up Ellesmere and Englefend to the crown of England,
and after that we hear no more of its being in the hands of the
Welsh.&nbsp; This being a frontier town and of some importance to
the marches, and consequently not to be left in the power of the
Prince of Wales.&nbsp; The continued skirmishes between the
English and the Welsh, made the tenure of the latter very
uncertain; and though King Henry II. and King John, being
embroiled in foreign wars, gave the town and castle in dower, the
first with his sister and the latter with his daughter, in order
to conciliate the ancient animosities of both people; yet upon
the least appearance of a rupture those kings might and did
resume at pleasure, or gave what recompense they thought fit upon
the seizure, and such as the Prince of Wales holding upon their
good behaviour were glad to receive.&nbsp; On the 12th of Edward
II., Roger L. Estrange, with the king&rsquo;s approbation,
granted several parcels of land, part of the demesnes of the
manor, to several persons in fee, at which time the wastes and
the commons of the manor were enclosed, and converted into
freeholds.&nbsp; Two years after Oliver de Ingeham, who adhered
so firmly to the king, upon the insurrection of the Earl of
Lancaster and other lords, was governor of this castle.&nbsp; In
the following reign a writ was issued, to inquire concerning the
encroachments made by the tenants of the neighbouring manors, and
to settle the boundaries, which being performed, the king gave
the castle and manor of Ellesmere to Eubule L. Estrange, a
younger son of the baron of Knockin.&nbsp; In the reign of
Elizabeth we find Thomas Egerton, an ancient lawyer, created
Baron Ellesmere; in the 23rd of Elizabeth he was made
Solicitor-General, and afterwards Attorney-General, from which
advancement he was soon after promoted to the Mastership of the
Rolls and the office of Keeper of the Great Seal, which he held
till that queen&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The Duke of Bridgewater is
deserving of notice in this place, as having been possessed of
large estates in Ellesmere and its neighbourhood, and as being
distinguished for his public spirit, and for the vast plans he
formed and executed for the improvement of his estates.&nbsp; He
died in 1803, and the dukedom became extinct.&nbsp; On the death
of the late Countess of Bridgewater the estates became vested in
Viscount Alford, and he dying in the autumn of the year 1850,
they are now vested in trustees.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Mary,
stands on a considerable elevation, overlooking the Mere, and
presents a fine specimen of ecclesiastical architecture, for the
most part in the decorative style.&nbsp; It is a spacious
cruciform structure, comprising nave, chancel, side aisles,
transepts, two side chapels, and a handsome square tower, adorned
with pinnacles.&nbsp; The sacred edifice underwent a thorough
restoration during the year 1849, when an entirely new nave and
side aisles were built, at a cost of upwards of &pound;8,000,
from a design of George G. Scott, Esq., architect.&nbsp; The
original nave bore marks of being the most ancient part of the
building, and presented traces of the old Norman style.&nbsp; One
of the pillars which stands near the pulpit on the north side of
the western arch of the tower is the only part of the old nave
remaining.&nbsp; On entering the church at either of the transept
doors the spectator cannot fail to admire the bold span of the
central arches on <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>which the tower rests.&nbsp; The exterior of the
eastern end remains as it was, the work of enlargement being
confined to the western side.&nbsp; The roof is of open timber
work of very high pitch, and the curve of the beams according so
exactly with the form of the central arches, renders the vista of
the church singularly fine.&nbsp; The same character of roof is
extended over the side aisles.&nbsp; This part of the building
receives the bulk of the congregation, and is neatly fitted up
with open seats of oak, uniform in their character, with their
facings relieved by tracery of various patterns, and affording
about 900 appropriated sittings.&nbsp; The transepts have been
provided with benches, thereby affording room for more than 300
sittings.&nbsp; On the north side of the western arch of the
tower stands the pulpit, which is of stone, and richly
carved.&nbsp; On the opposite side is the desk for reading
prayers; and under the central part of the tower is placed the
lectern, from which the lessons are read.&nbsp; The chancel has
been thoroughly restored and altered, and the old screens which
separated it from the side chapels renovated, and decorated with
highly-finished tracery.&nbsp; On each side are stalls with
carved finials, and otherwise ornamented, containing seats for
the clergy and the choir.&nbsp; The paving is composed of
encaustic tiles, in patterns which increase in richness as they
approach the east.&nbsp; The altar stands on an elevation of five
steps from the level of the entrance of the chancel, and is
backed by a reredos of encaustic tiles.&nbsp; The three sedilia
on the south side, which were in good preservation, have been
restored to their original use.&nbsp; By means of a separate
subscription a new organ, which cost 300 guineas, built by
Holditch, of London, has been placed in the south chapel: the
instrument is of great power and sweetness, and finely
contributes to the musical part of the services.&nbsp; A new
octagonal font of carved stone&mdash;an exact representation of
the old one&mdash;has been placed in the south aisle.&nbsp; The
south chapel, commonly called the Otely chapel, is distinguished
by a curious oak roof, with carved panels, and though it cannot
lay claim to a date earlier than the 16th century, yet it forms
one of the most beautiful features in the old part of the
church.&nbsp; This chapel contains a fine altar tomb, elaborately
ornamented, on which are recumbent figures cut in marble, to the
memory of Francis Kynaston and his wife, with the date 1790.</p>
<p>Other decorations, in various parts, are not wanting to help
the effect and beauty of the restoration.&nbsp; Besides the rich
carving in stone on the corbels and doors, and the wood tracery
and highly-finished screen work, eighteen of the windows are
richly ornamented with stained glass, by the liberality of
various donors.&nbsp; The magnificent east window, the gift of
Robert Clarke, Esq., late agent to the Bridgewater estates, was
executed by Evans, of Shrewsbury, some twenty years ago.&nbsp; In
the different compartments of the window are the four
evangelists; the arms of David Prince of Wales; Llewellyn Prince
of Wales; Sir Roger le Strange, who in the reign of Edward III.,
granted the second charter to the town; Lord Chancellor Egerton,
&amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; The west window, a beautiful specimen of
the decorated Gothic, is conceived and executed in the highest
taste, and is illustrative of the four Christian graces of Faith,
Hope, and Charity.&nbsp; It was the joint presentation of J. and
G. Stanton, Esqs., in memory of Thomas Stanton, Esq., and was
executed by Warrington of London.&nbsp; In the south transept is
a fine window by Wailes of Newcastle, in memory of the late
vicar, the Rev. J. A. Cotton, added by his surviving
family.&nbsp; The three windows in the south aisle are by the
same artist, and all gifts to the church.&nbsp; The first,
representing the crucifixion of our Lord, was presented by the
widow of the late Captain Fowler; the next, the gift of the
Oswell family, is illustrative of our Saviour&rsquo;s ascension
into heaven; the third represents infant and adult baptism, and
was presented by Colonel Salisbury.&nbsp; Some of the other
windows are filled with ornamental glass, with a light pattern
foliage upon each square, and scrolls containing texts of
scripture running obliquely through them.&nbsp; One of the same
sort, but more richly ornamented, is placed in the Oteley chapel,
in memory of some of the faithful retainers of the household of
C. K. Mainwaring, Esq.&nbsp; The church has thus been rendered
one of the most beautiful ecclesiastical edifices in the county,
by the liberality of the parishioners <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>and other donors, under the skill
and taste of its able architect.&nbsp; The extreme length of the
church is 140 feet, and width 79 feet.&nbsp; The late Countess of
Bridgewater gave the munificent sum of &pound;3,300 towards the
restorations; the Diocesan Society, &pound;350; the Incorporated
Society for Enlarging and Building Churches, &pound;150; and
&pound;227. 2s. 6d. was collected after a sermon preached by the
Bishop of Lichfield at the consecration of the church, on the
11th October, 1849.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, valued in the
King&rsquo;s book at &pound;17. 18s. l&frac12;d.; returned in the
Clergy List at &pound;386; in the patronage of the trustees of
the late Earl of Bridgewater, and incumbency of the Rev. John
David Day, M.A.; curate, Rev. John Peake, B.A.&nbsp; The
churchyard was enlarged in 1850, by the addition of near half an
acre of land on the west side of the church.&nbsp; The vicarage
is pleasantly situated on elevated ground near the south side of
the churchyard.&nbsp; Ellesmere is remarkable for the longevity
of its inhabitants: in 1767 Jane Holt died, at the age of 108
years; and her husband died in 1757, aged 98 years.&nbsp; Among
the various memorials in the churchyard is a remarkable epitaph
to William Parks, who died at Lee, in 1746, aged 104
years:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Interr&rsquo;d here, lies one hundred years
and four;<br />
No one knew scripture less and virtue more:<br />
Peace his ambition, contentment was his wealth,<br />
Honesty his pride,&mdash;his passions health,<br />
The father&rsquo;s duty, and the husband&rsquo;s guide;<br />
By nature good, the age&rsquo;s wonder died.&rdquo;</p>

1844.&nbsp; There is also a <span class="smcap">Wesleyan
Association Chapel</span>, built in 1835, and a <span
class="smcap">Primitive Methodist Chapel</span>, built in 1840,
both situated in Scotland street.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
National School</span>, which stands near the wharf, has an
attendance of 160 scholars.&nbsp; The school room is spacious and
lofty, and was built at the sole expense of the Countess of
Bridgewater, who also gave the sum of &pound;200 towards the
support of the school.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Girls&rsquo;
National School</span>, situated on St. John&rsquo;s hill, has an
attendance of 85 children.&nbsp; The vicar, with a laudable
desire to extend the advantages of education, established what is
termed the <span class="smcap">Middle School</span>, in 1848, on
St. John&rsquo;s Hill, where the youths are instructed in the
higher branches of learning.&nbsp; The school is built of wood,
and covered with thatch, and the interior lined with panelled
oak, taken from the old church on its restoration.&nbsp; It was
built at the sole expense of the vicar, whose zeal and
persevering efforts in the education of youth are worthy of
commendation.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Town Hall</span>, a
handsome building of freestone, was erected by the munificence of
the late Countess of Bridgewater.&nbsp; The lower compartment of
the structure is used for the sale of butter, poultry, &amp;c.,
on the market days; above it is a spacious room for magisterial
and other purposes, with suitable offices.&nbsp; The magistrates
hold a petty sessions here on the first Monday in the
month.&nbsp; The Countess of Bridgewater kindly granted the use
of the large room to the <span class="smcap">Mechanics&rsquo;
Institution</span>, which was established in 1845.&nbsp; There
are about forty members, adults paying 6s. per annum, and
apprentices 4s.&nbsp; A library has been established, and
gratuitous lectures are occasionally given by the clergy and
gentlemen in the neighbourhood, on interesting and scientific
subjects.&nbsp; G. H. Smith is the secretary.&nbsp; A <span
class="smcap">Court Leet</span> is held annually, when a coroner
and two bailiffs are appointed.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Savings&rsquo; Bank</span> is situated in Scotland
street.&nbsp; It was established in 1817, and then held in a
private house.&nbsp; The present structure was built in 1830,
from the surplus funds of the bank, at a cost of
&pound;550.&nbsp; The capital stock of the bank on November 20th,
1849, was &pound;29,562. 15s. 2&frac14;d., at which time there
were 752 separate accounts, of which eight were charitable
societies, having deposits to the amount of &pound;854. 14s.
10&frac12;d., and twelve <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>friendly societies, the deposits of
which amounted to &pound;3,527. 15s. 2&frac14;d.&nbsp; Of the
total depositors there were 392 whose respective balances did not
exceed &pound;20; 180 above &pound;20 and not exceeding
&pound;50; 90 above that sum and not exceeding &pound;100; 41 not
exceeding &pound;150; 21 not exceeding &pound;200; and 8 above
&pound;200.&nbsp; Mr. William Lee is the actuary.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Gas Works</span> have been established in the town
by a company of shareholders.&nbsp; The works are situated near
the canal wharf.&nbsp; The commercial intercourse of Oswestry is
facilitated by the Shropshire union canal, previously
noticed.&nbsp; The township of Oswestry, in 1841, comprised 446
houses and 2,326 inhabitants.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Ellesmere Union House</span> is a
spacious brick structure, pleasantly situated about a quarter of
a mile from the church, on a gentle acclivity overlooking the
Mere.&nbsp; It was built in 1792, and will accommodate 350
inmates.&nbsp; The average number in the house is usually about
150.&nbsp; The internal arrangements are well managed, and have a
clean and orderly appearance.&nbsp; The union comprehends
eighteen parishes, of which nine are in the county of Flint, and
nine in Shropshire, embracing an area of 109 square miles.&nbsp;
The parishes are Bettisfield, Bronington, Halghton, Hanmer,
Iscoyd, Overton, Penley, Tybroughton, Willington, Baschurch,
Ellesmere, Hadnal Ease, Hordley, Middle, Ness Great, Ness Little,
Petton, and Welsh Hampton.&nbsp; The south-west wing is occupied
by the males, and the north-east wing by the females.&nbsp; In
the latter is the Chapel, which is neatly and appropriately
fitted up, and set apart for divine worship.&nbsp; In this
respect, we think the authorities of the Ellesmere union have set
a laudable example, which might be followed by other unions; for
the honest poor are scarcely put on a level with the felons of
our prisons in chapel accommodation.&nbsp; There are twenty-three
guardians appointed by the different parishes.&nbsp; Richard
George Jebb, Esq., is chairman; Thomas Wood Lee, Esq.,
vice-chairman; Rev. George Walker, chaplain.&nbsp; The surgeons
are:&mdash;Thomas Gwynn, for the house and town district; Thomas
Mousley, for Hordley and Dudliston district; Edward Ellis Eyton,
Welsh Hampton district; Charles Tomlinson, Hanmer district; John
Ellis Eyton, Overton district; Mr. Broughton, Baschurch district;
and Andrew M. Needham, for the Middle district.&nbsp; Clerk:
Andrew Bickley.&nbsp; Relieving officers: John Wood Jones,
Ellesmere district, and John Poycott, Hanmer district.&nbsp;
Master: John Pembrey Pritchard.&nbsp; Matron: Sarah
Pritchard.&nbsp; Schoolmaster: Edward Jones.&nbsp;
Schoolmistress: Mary Pay.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Edward
Jeffereys</i>, by his will, bearing date January 4th, 1687,
devised a messuage and lands, in Osbaston, to the churchwardens
and overseers of the parish of Oswestry and Ellesmere, upon
trust, to dispose of two parts of the yearly profits for the
relief of poor inhabitants of Ellesmere, 16s. 8d. at Christmas,
and the rest on Good Friday; and 16s. 8d. of the yearly profits
to be divided among the poor inhabitants of Maesbury, Moreton,
and Crickett&mdash;6s. 8d. to the former, and 5s. each to the two
latter townships.&nbsp; The property thus devised consists of two
cottages and six closes, containing together 5<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 22<span
class="smcap">p</span>.&nbsp; It is let, from time to time, by
the churchwardens of Ellesmere, and now produces a rental of
&pound;12. 2s.</p>
<p>The following benefactions were probably laid out in the
purchase of the Whixall estate, as hereafter
noticed:&mdash;&pound;10 given by <i>Jerome Hanmer</i>, the
interest to be applied in apprentice fees; &pound;6 by <i>Hugh
Dod</i>, for a distribution of bread in Hardwick and about the
Perthy; &pound;20 by <i>William Thorowgood</i>, for the
instruction of poor children; &pound;50 by <i>John Lyth</i>, for
the use of the poor; &pound;50 by <i>Catherine Pennant</i>, the
interest to provide twelve blue coats for six poor men and six
poor women; &pound;20 by <i>Catherine Wenlock</i>, the interest
to educate five boys; &pound;10 by <i>Thomas Pitchford</i>, for
the poor of Trench and Northwood; &pound;5 by <i>Catherine
Higginson</i>, for a distribution of bread in Ellesmere; &pound;5
by <i>Edward Teggin</i>, for bread to be distributed in Hardwick;
&pound;7 by <i>William Pearce</i>, for charitable uses; &pound;40
by <i>John Powell</i>, the interest to be given among poor
inhabitants of Ellesmere and Colemere; &pound;20 by <i>Mrs.
Powell</i>, for the same purpose; &pound;10 by <i>William
Pearce</i>, for the benefit of the poor of Welsh Northwood;
&pound;10 by <i>John Davies</i>, for a distribution of <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>bread every
Sunday; &pound;10 by <i>John Higginson</i>, for the good of the
poor; &pound;5 by <i>Charles Mason</i>, for charitable uses;
&pound;10 by <i>Margaret Eddowes</i>, the interest to be given
away among the poor of Trench, Northwood, and Hampton&rsquo;s
Wood.&nbsp; These several gifts amount in the whole to the sum of
&pound;288.&nbsp; About the year 1733, the several charitable
legacies left to the poor of the parish had for some time laid
dead, with interest, when the churchwardens purchased an estate
at Whixall, for the sum of &pound;320, having borrowed &pound;30
to make up that sum.&nbsp; The estate consists of seven closes in
Whixall, containing 22<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 30<span class="smcap">p</span>.&nbsp;
There is also an allotment of peat ground on Whixall Moss,
containing 1<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 25<span class="smcap">p</span>.&nbsp; The
premises are let at a yearly rent of &pound;28, and after
deducting the amount of any incidental expenses that may be
incurred, is generally applied in the following manner,
viz.:&mdash;&pound;10 as a subscription to the National School;
&pound;2 to Dudleston School; &pound;4 to Cockshut School;
&pound;3. 14s. 9d. for three gowns and three coats for old men
and old women; 12s. to the poor of Colemere; 12s. to the poor of
Northwood; 12s. to the poor of Trench; &pound;1. 16s. for a
distribution of bread; and the residue is distributed by the
vicar and the churchwardens in small sums among the most
necessitous poor.</p>
<p><i>William Wenlock</i>, by will, 1691, charged his tenement,
with its appurtenances, in Northop, in the county of Flint, with
the payment of &pound;6 per annum, to buy yearly good books, and
particularly Bibles, the Whole Duty of Man, and other books of
practical divinity, to be distributed in the parish of Northop
and Ellesmere&mdash;&pound;3 thereof to be expended for each
parish.&nbsp; The &pound;3 is annually received by the vicar of
Ellesmere, and the amount is laid out in the purchase of Bibles,
and other books published by the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge.</p>
<p><i>Jane Higginson</i>, by will, 1707, gave to the poorest and
most necessitous children of the parish of Ellesmere, the sum of
&pound;6, payable out of certain premises once in every five
years&mdash;20s. thereof to be expended in clothing.&nbsp; The
sum of &pound;6 is received by the vicar once in five years,
which is generally disposed of in buying different articles of
clothing; but occasionally a portion has been paid for their
schooling.</p>
<p><i>Ruth Davies</i> left &pound;10, the interest to be given in
bread to the poor, every Sunday in Lent.&nbsp; This sum is
secured, with other charity money hereafter mentioned, on the
Ellesmere House of Industry.&nbsp; The yearly sum of 9s. is paid
as interest, and given away in bread.&nbsp; <i>John
Higginson</i>, in 1771, bequeathed &pound;20 for the benefit of
the poor.&nbsp; This sum is also secured on the House of
Industry, and 18s. paid as the interest thereof.</p>
<p><i>Richard Oulton</i>, by will, 1780, gave to the vicar and
churchwardens of Ellesmere &pound;100, to be placed out on good
security, and the interest applied in buying coals for the use of
poor decayed housekeepers.&nbsp; This sum of &pound;100, with
&pound;10 belonging to Davis&rsquo;s charity, &pound;20 the
legacy of John Higginson, and &pound;20 left by the same person
to the use of the organist of Ellesmere, making altogether
&pound;150, is secured by a bond, bearing date 13th October,
1795, given to the vicar and churchwardens by the directors of
the Ellesmere House of Industry, which was established under an
act passed 31st George III.</p>
<p><i>John Whittall</i>, of East Greenwich, by will, 1798,
bequeathed to the parish of Ellesmere &pound;200 five per cent.
annuities, the dividends to be paid by the churchwardens and
overseers to ten poor housekeepers, on the 24th of December
annually.&nbsp; In respect of this legacy there are now
&pound;210 new four per cents, standing in the names of certain
trustees.&nbsp; The dividends, amounting to &pound;8. 8s. per
annum, are distributed by the vicar and overseers every 24th of
December equally among ten poor housekeepers; no person being
appointed two successive years.</p>
<p><i>Penelope Vaughan</i>, who died in 1805, bequeathed to the
churchwardens and overseers of the parish of Ellesmere
&pound;100, to be disposed of for the use of the poor of the said
parish.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;90, the produce of this legacy
after the payment of the duty, was invested on the security of
the Ellesmere House of Industry, the bond bearing date 7th
January, 1808.&nbsp; The interest, amounting to &pound;4. 1s., at
four and a half per cent., is applied by the vicar, partly for
the support of different schools, and partly distributed in small
sums among the poor of the parish.</p>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span><i>Richard Wynn</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, who died in 1823,
bequeathed &pound;100 to the vicar and church wardens of
Ellesmere, upon trust, to place out the same, and pay the
interest, on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day yearly, to poor widows and
widowers resident in the township of Crickett, Hardwick, and
Upper and Lower Ridge, in such proportions as the owner, for the
time being, of the testator&rsquo;s mansion at Crickett should
think fit.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;90, received in respect of
this legacy (&pound;10 being deducted for duty), is placed in the
Savings&rsquo; Bank at Ellesmere.</p>
<p><i>Lady Bridgewater</i> bequeathed &pound;200 for the support
of the National School at Ellesmere</p>

<h4>COLEMERE</h4>
<p>is a township, having a scattered population, three miles E.E.
by S. from Ellesmere, containing 1,449<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 8<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, of which 1,248 acres are vested
in the trustees of the late Earl of Bridgewater.&nbsp; The soil
is generally fertile, and produces good crops of wheat and
barley.&nbsp; There is a fine mere or pool of water, which covers
a considerable surface, within the bounds of this township.&nbsp;
At the census in 1841 there were 39 houses and 192
inhabitants.</p>
<p>The principal residents in this township are the following

<h4>DUDLESTON, <span class="GutSmall">OR</span> DUDLISTON,</h4>
<p>formerly written <span class="smcap">Duddlestone</span>, is a
township and chapelry in the parish of Ellesmere, four miles and
a half N.W. from that town, and eight miles N.N.E. from
Oswestry.&nbsp; The chapelry comprises the townships of
Pentrecoed, Criftins, Chapel, Coadyrallt, and Dudleston, which
together have an area of 4,640<span class="smcap">a</span>.
1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 24<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land, mostly an undulating district, in some parts highly
productive, and in other parts of an inferior quality.&nbsp; At
the census of 1841 there were 950 houses and 1,207
inhabitants.&nbsp; The houses are in general scattered, and there
are a considerable number of detached cottages, which in many
instances were originally built upon the unenclosed land; and
they have generally a small plot, or a few acres of land attached
to each cottage.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Edward
Morrall, Esq.; Lord Dungannon; George Harper, Esq.; James
Edwards, Esq.; Rev. John Morrall; George Bennett, Esq.; John
Owen, Esq.; Charles Brown Owen, Esq.; John Davies, Esq.; William
Dickin, Esq.; Hon. William M. B. Nugent; Mr. Richard Edwards;
Miss Benyon; Mr. Samuel Lea; Mr. Robert Grindley; Mrs. Elizabeth
Jones; Miss Boydell; Mr. Dymock; Mr. John Vaughan; Miss Kynaston;
Mr. James Munslow; and Miss Broom; besides whom are several other
freeholders.&nbsp; Edward Morrall, Esq., is lord of the manor of
Traian, which includes the parish of St. Martin&rsquo;s and
Dudleston chapelry.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Chapel</span>
is a neat structure, situated on elevated ground, built of rough
stone, with hewn quoins and finishings.&nbsp; It consists of nave
and side aisles, with an octagonal tower surmounted with short
pinnacles.&nbsp; The body of the church was rebuilt in 1819, at a
cost of &pound;431. 13s., towards which the Society for Building
and Enlarging Churches gave the sum of &pound;200.&nbsp; It
contains several neat mural monuments to the Boydells, of
Kilhendre and Sodylt Hall, and the Morralls.&nbsp; The pulpit is
of oak, curiously carved.&nbsp; At the west end of the church are
three venerable yew trees, now much decayed.&nbsp; The living is
a perpetual curacy, returned at &pound;238, in the patronage of
the Vicar of Ellesmere, and enjoyed by the Rev. David
Birds.&nbsp; The Wesleyan Methodists and the Independent
Methodists have each a small chapel on Dudleston Heath.&nbsp; The
Association Methodists have a chapel at the Gravel Holes.&nbsp;
There are two manufactories of bricks, tiles, and brown
earthenware, in this township; and coal is got at the Flannag
colliery, near to Coed-y-rallt.&nbsp; The pits, however, are
within the bounds of St. Martin&rsquo;s parish, but the
underground works extend into this chapelry.&nbsp; The coal is of
a superior quality, and the seams are from one foot to three feet
in thickness.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile from the church, on the brow of a
hill, overlooking a beautiful valley richly wooded, is <span
class="smcap">Kilhendre</span>, the residence of Captain
Johnson.&nbsp; On the site of the present house, about fifty
years ago, stood a very ancient mansion of chequered timber and
brick work, the residence of the Edwards, who had been settled
there for upwards of six centuries, and possessed considerable
estates, in Dudleston, St. Martin&rsquo;s, and the neighbouring
townships.&nbsp; Here Colonel Jones, governor of Dublin, a very
active and successful officer during the Commonwealth, for some
time found a peaceful asylum after Cromwell&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
In the centre of the house was a chamber, into which you
descended by steps, and the passages to which were hidden by
tapestry, evidently intended as a place of concealment in cases
of sudden danger.&nbsp; The rooms were low, gloomy, and
inconvenient, and a large hall occupied half the house.&nbsp; The
house and demesnes were alienated in the year 1800, and soon
after purchased by Mr. Boydell, in whose representative, Miss
Boydell, they are now vested.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Plas
Yollen</span> is a handsome and pleasantly situated dwelling, the
residence of Robert Morrall, Esq.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Plas-warren</span>, an ancient house, the residence
and property of Edward Morrall, Esq., who is also the owner of
Plas-yollen.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Erway</span> is a
handsome house of modern construction, and the residence <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>of Richard
Ellerton, Esq.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Sodylt Hall</span> is a
pleasantly situated house, with tasteful pleasure grounds, the
residence of George Bennett, Esq.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Shelbrook</span> is a good house, the residence and
property of John Jones, Esq.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Pentre-coed</span> is the residence and property of
William Dickin, Esq.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Dudleston
Hall</span>, a modern brick house, stands about 100 yards south
from the site of the old hall, and is the residence and property
of John Davies, Esq.&nbsp; At the northern extremity of the
chapelry of Dudleston the county terminates in an elevated and
precipitous rock, called <span class="smcap">Coed-y-rallt</span>,
which commands one of the most beautiful views of bold and
romantic scenery that can well be conceived.&nbsp; The shelving
precipice is clothed with a thriving plantation; and deep below
wind the dark waters of the Dee, which separates this county from
Wales.&nbsp; Other features in the scenery are the beautiful
grounds and woods of Nant-y-lielan, the aqueducts of Chirk and
Ponte-y-cysyllte, Chirk Castle, and Bryn-Kynalt, the beautiful
seat of Lord Dungannon, all backed by the bold swells and the
Alpine heights of the Welsh mountains.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Frances
Edwards</i>, in 1719, conveyed certain premises in Dudleston, and
directed them to be converted into a school and residence for a
schoolmistress; to be kept in repair by such person as for the
time being should be entitled to her capital messuage called
Kilhendre; she also gave a rent charge of &pound;10 per annum,
issuing out of the great farm in Dudleston; &pound;4. 10s.
thereof to be paid to the schoolmistress, who should instruct
twenty-four poor children; 10s. to buy books for the children;
&pound;3 to be paid in apprentice fees; 20s. for a distribution
of bread every Sunday to five poor aged persons; and 20s., the
residue thereof, to be expended in flannel, and given to the
poor.&nbsp; The school is situated near the church, and occupied
by a female, who teaches twenty-four poor children.&nbsp; The
rent charge is expended in carrying out the donor&rsquo;s
intentions.</p>
<p><i>John Jones</i>, by his will, dated 26th February, 1725,
directed his executors to pay &pound;100 to the incumbent,
chapelwardens, and overseers, of the poor of Dudleston, to
purchase land for the benefit of the poor.&nbsp; This gift, with
&pound;20 given by a servant, &pound;10 by Roger Jennings, and
&pound;5 by Mr. Roberts, were laid out in 1740 in the purchase of
6<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>.
21<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land.&nbsp; There is also an
allotment of about a quarter of an acre set out on the enclosure
of Dudleston common, the whole of which is let for &pound;8. 12s.
6d., and distributed to the poor on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day.&nbsp;
The sum of &pound;10, left by a servant man in 1735, and
&pound;10 left by another servant man in 1739, are charged upon
the Sodylt estate, and the interest, 20s. per annum, is
distributed with the above charity.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Kynaston</i>, in 1761, left &pound;200, the interest
to be annually distributed to the poor.&nbsp; This money is
invested on the security of the turnpike road from Wem to
Bron-y-Garth.</p>
<p><i>William Challnor</i>, in 1791, bequeathed &pound;100, the
interest to be applied in the relief of twenty of the poorest
inhabitants of the chapelry.&nbsp; <i>Elizabeth Challnor</i>, by
will, 1807, bequeathed &pound;100 to augment the charity of her
father-in-law, William Challnor.&nbsp; The first bequest is
secured on the tolls of the road from Wem to Bron-y-Garth; and
the latter is secured on the Ellesmere House of Industry.&nbsp;
The interest, &pound;9. 1s., is distributed on New Year&rsquo;s
day among the most necessitous poor.</p>

Dr. Thomas Bray, an eminent, learned, and pious divine of the
seventeenth century, was born at Marton, in Shropshire, in
1656.&nbsp; He was educated at Oswestry Grammar School, and was
the principal promoter of the Missionary Society <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>denominated
<i>The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign
Parts</i>.&nbsp; Dr. Bray was instrumental in raising lending
libraries in many parts of England and Wales, in connection with
episcopal places of worship, out of which the neighbouring clergy
might borrow the books they had occasion for, and where they
might consult upon matters relating to their function and
learning; similar libraries were also established in the American
colonies for the use of the missionaries, which were subsequently
secured to posterity by an act of parliament passed for that
purpose in 1708.&nbsp; In the year 1712 the Dr. printed his
&ldquo;Martyrology, or Papal Usurpation,&rdquo; in folio.&nbsp;
This work consists of some choice and learned treatises of
celebrated authors, which were grown very scarce, ranged and
digested into a regular history.&nbsp; He proposed to compile a
second volume, and had, at no small expense and pains, furnished
himself with materials for it, but he was afterwards obliged to
lay the prosecution of his design aside, and bequeathed by will
his valuable collection of martyrological memoirs, both printed
and manuscript, to Zion College.&nbsp; In the year 1726 he was
employed in composing and printing his Directorium Missionarium,
and his Primordia Bibliothecaria.&nbsp; About this time he also
wrote a short account of Mr. Rawlet, the author of the Christian
Monitor, and reprinted the life of Mr. Gilpin.&nbsp; Some of
these were calculated for the use of missionaries, and in one of
these he has endeavoured to show that civilizing the Indians must
be the first step in any successful attempt for their
conversion.&nbsp; As the furnishing the parochial clergy with the
means of instruction would be an effectual method to promote
Christian knowledge, so another expedient manifestly subservient
to the same end would be, he thought, to imprint on the minds of
those who are designed for the ministry, previously to their
admission, a just sense of its various duties, and their great
importance.&nbsp; With a view to this he reprinted the
Ecclesiastes of Erasmus, a name of great authority in the
republic of letters, and to whom the re-establishment of polite
literature was principally owing.&nbsp; Dr. Bray was a frequent
visitor of the prisons, the inmates of which always excited the
highest degree of compassion in his breast, and to the temporal
benefits which he munificently bestowed, he always subjoined
spiritual comforts.&nbsp; He died on the 15th February, 1730, in
the 73rd year of his age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;By indenture,
dated 8th September, 1753, <i>John Edwards</i>, <i>Esq.</i>
conveyed a plot of land called the Chapel Yard, at Nesscliffe, to
the Rev. William Parry, then vicar <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>of Great Ness, for the erection of a
school and residence for the teacher.&nbsp; The following
benefactions are stated to have been given towards the support of
the school, viz., <i>Sir Orlando Bridgeman</i>, &pound;20; <i>Sir
John Langham</i>, &pound;10; <i>Mrs. Pridie</i>, &pound;20; the
<i>Rev. William Parry</i>, &pound;25; and <i>Mrs. Parry</i>,
&pound;25.&nbsp; This sum, amounting to &pound;100, was in the
hands of John Edwards, Esq., when the charity commissioners
published their report, and he paid interest for it at the rate
of five per cent.&nbsp; The master resides in a house built on
the land, containing about an acre in the whole, and in
consideration of the above emoluments is required to teach six
poor children in reading, writing, and accounts, without any
charge.</p>
<p><i>Samuel Shuker</i>, by will bearing date June 18th, 1821,
devised two leasehold estates, then let at a yearly rent of
&pound;148. 15s., to John Edwards, Esq., upon trust to sell the
same, and to invest the proceeds of such sale in the public
funds, and out of the first year&rsquo;s dividends to improve the
present school house, and afterwards to pay the dividends yearly,
in promoting the views of the said school, by causing so many
poor children of indigent parents, not exceeding the age of
twelve years, nor under the age of six years, to be properly
instructed in reading, writing, and the four first rules of
arithmetic, and finding them in books, pens, ink, and paper; the
proportions of such children to be admitted into the said school
being two boys and one girl.&nbsp; The property above mentioned
was sold by John Edwards, Esq., to whom the testator left the
residue of his personal estate, not otherwise disposed of, the
bequest to the charity being void under the statute of 9 George
II., c. 36.&nbsp; The produce of the sale of the above estates
was about &pound;1,070.&nbsp; Mr. Edwards proposed settling this
property ultimately upon the school, but retaining the disposal
of the produce thereof for his life.</p>
<p><i>Margaret Dyos</i>, by will 1729, bequeathed &pound;10, and
directed the proceeds to be distributed to the poor of Great Ness
for the first three years, and the fourth year to the poor of
Kinnerley, and so on in rotation from four years to four
years.&nbsp; This gift and &pound;5 in the hands of the parish
officers was laid out in the purchase of a piece of land in
Melverley, which now produces a yearly rent of &pound;1. 10s.</p>
<p><i>William Phillip</i> left a rent-charge of 5s. yearly, to be
distributed among twenty poor housekeepers.&nbsp; The sum of 5s.
is paid yearly to the churchwardens of Great Ness, as charged
upon the Plough Inn, at Wellington, by Mr. Leeke, the owner of
those premises.</p>

master receives 20s. per annum for every scholar admitted; John
Jones is the teacher.&nbsp; Over the school house door is the
following inscription, which has reference to a chapel dedicated
to St. Mary, which formerly stood near the site of the
school:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God prosper and prolong this public
good,<br />
A school erected where a chapel stood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The school was built in 1753.&nbsp; This village is celebrated
for its immense quarries of red sand stone, from which blocks of
almost any dimensions can be raised.&nbsp; The red stone of which
the castle, town walls, abbey, and most other old buildings in
Shrewsbury are formed, was in all probability brought from this
place.&nbsp; Nesscliffe hill will amply repay the labour of an
ascent, the prospect is most delightful and varied.&nbsp; On the
side of the hill is the celebrated <span
class="smcap">Kynaston&rsquo;s Cave</span>, perched like an
eagle&rsquo;s nest upon the brow of an overhanging
precipice.&nbsp; Humphrey Kynaston was the keeper or constable of
Middle Castle, who from his dissolute and riotous manner of life,
was surnamed <i>The Wild</i>.&nbsp; The enormous debts he
contracted by his conduct caused him to be declared an outlaw,
upon which he fled from Middle Castle, and sheltered himself in a
cave in Nesscliffe rock, called to this day
&ldquo;Kynaston&rsquo;s Cave.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is divided into two
rooms by a strong pillar of the rock, upon which is carved,
&ldquo;H. K., 1564.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of these was the stall for
the celebrated outlaw&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp; The approach was by a
flight of broad steps, which have since been partly cut
away.&nbsp; Many a deed of daring is rehearsed of this high-born
freebooter; among others, his draining to Mr. Lloyd&rsquo;s
health, in that gentleman&rsquo;s court yard, the great hall
tankard of ale; and while some of the retainers were closing him
in, and others were securing every way of escape, Kynaston coolly
pocketed the silver cup, and clapping spurs to his horse, cleared
the gates and the heads of his would-be gaolers at a leap.&nbsp;
All his depredations seem more to have been dictated by whim than
a desire to plunder, for he supplied the wants of the poor by
dispensing the spoils he abstracted from the rich.&nbsp; His
grateful pensioners cooked for him in return, and found provender
for his elf-like steed; the rich paying him tribute through fear,
and the poor from gratitude.&nbsp; Kynaston was never taken, but
died, as tradition says, in his cave.</p>

<h4>LOPPINGTON</h4>
<p>is a parish and pleasantly situated village two and a half

to Wem, was the scene of several skirmishes between the royal and
the parliamentary forces in the civil wars.&nbsp; In one of these
skirmishes the royal party set fire to the floor and roof of the
church, which being covered with shingles was the more easily
accomplished, and the parliamentary soldiers who had taken refuge
in the church, were compelled to surrender it to the king&rsquo;s
party.&nbsp; The parish of Loppington comprises the townships of
Loppington, Burlton, and Noneley, and contains 3,411<span

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>John
Kynaston</i>, by his will, bearing date 30th May, 1694, devised a
house, garden, stable, and croft, in the township of Loppington,
to his kinsman, Roger Kynaston, and his heirs, to the use of the
then schoolmaster of Loppington, and his successors as a salary,
for their pains in teaching to read six of the poorest children
within the parish, to be appointed by the said Roger Kynaston and
his heirs; and if there should happen to be no schoolmaster, he
directed that the profits of the premises should be to the use of
Roger Kynaston and his heirs.&nbsp; The property devised by the
testator consists of a public house in Loppington, with a stable,
garden, and croft, containing altogether half an acre.&nbsp; The
property, when the Charity Commissioners published their report,
was claimed by Thomas Kynaston, grandson of Richard Kynaston,
named in the following conveyance:&mdash;&ldquo;By indenture,
bearing date 17th November, 1741, between Roger Kynaston,
grandson of Roger Kynaston, the devisee above-mentioned, of the
one part, and Richard Kynaston, of Loppington, of the other part,
reciting the will as above extracted, the said Roger Kynaston,
party thereto, in consideration of &pound;4 conveyed to the said
Richard Kynaston and his heirs, the messuage, tenements, and
lands, and all other the premises in the said will mentioned, and
all his estate and interest therein, subject nevertheless to the
trusts in the said will mentioned concerning the
same.&rdquo;&nbsp; The premises are let for &pound;13 per annum,
an additional sum of &pound;2 being paid by the tenant for a
piece of garden formerly no part of the trust premises.&nbsp; The
rent of &pound;13 is received by Thomas Kynaston, and he pays
thereout &pound;2 yearly to a schoolmaster for the instruction of
six poor children.&nbsp; The residue of the rent Thomas Kynaston
reserves to his own use; but it is clear that the whole of the
rent above-mentioned is applicable to the charitable uses
mentioned in the testator&rsquo;s will, and that notwithstanding
that in the conveyance of 1731, &pound;4 was paid as a
consideration, Thomas Kynaston can only be considered as a
trustee for such charitable uses.&nbsp; It is stated that within
the last twenty years Thomas Kynaston has laid out upwards of
&pound;300 in rebuilding and improving the premises, but as he
has been in possession between thirty and forty years, and during
that time has enjoyed the benefit of all the surplus rent beyond
the yearly sum of &pound;2, there seems to be no reason why the
schoolmaster should not from the present time receive the benefit
of the whole rent.&nbsp; It seems also desirable that new
trustees should be appointed; but considering the testator vested
the property solely in his kinsman, Richard Kynaston, and his
heirs, we apprehend that a conveyance to new trustees would not
be enforced in a court of equity, provided the said Thomas
Kynaston gives up all claim to any beneficial interest
therein.</p>
<p><i>Jane Manlove</i>, in 1751, bequeathed &pound;10, and
directed the interest to be disposed of in the purchase of
clothing for poor widows; the interest to be applied two years to
poor widows resident in Loppington township, and the third year
to widows of Burlton township.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Price</i>, in 1797, bequeathed &pound;50, the
interest to be applied in a distribution of bread every Sunday;
he also bequeathed the residue of his personal estate, after the
payment of certain legacies, for the same purpose.&nbsp; To this
legacy of &pound;50 and &pound;30 in augmentation thereof out of
personal estate, and the sum of &pound;10 given by Mrs. Menlove,
as above-mentioned, &pound;10 was added by the parish to make up
&pound;100, which sum was laid out on mortgage of three cottages
in Wem, the deed bearing date the 1st August, 1820.&nbsp; The
interest, &pound;4, is distributed according to the donor&rsquo;s
intentions.&nbsp; The particulars of Richard Corbet&rsquo;s
charity will be found noticed with Wem.&nbsp; There is a farm of
about 63 acres of land in this parish, the rent of which for a
great number of years (certainly from 1690) has been considered
as applicable to the repairs of the church, the relief of the
poor, and such other purposes as the parishioners should direct,
and has been so applied at their discretion.</p>
<p><i>Mary Griffiths</i>, in 1837, bequeathed &pound;300 in the
three per cent. consols, and directed the interest to be
distributed in money or clothes for the benefit of the poor.</p>

and in 1841 had 35 houses and 172 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;1,604.&nbsp; The soil is various; in some parts a
cold clay prevails, and in other places there is a loamy soil,
with a mixture of gravel.&nbsp; The principal landowners are R.
C. Vaughan, Esq., Thomas Woodfield, Samuel Lee, Robert Leeke,
John Menlove, Esq., William Sparling, Esq., The Corporation of
Shrewsbury, Thomas Dickin, Esq., Mr. John Platt, Mr. Nicholas
Robinson, Mr. Peter Shingler, and Mr. Peter Shingler, jun.;
besides whom there are several smaller proprietors.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Burlton Green</span> is a plot of waste land,
containing two acres, the herbage of which is claimed by the
freeholders.&nbsp; There is also a considerable tract of woodland
in this township.&nbsp; A court leet and baron is held yearly at
the Coach and Horses, by the lord of the manor, Robert C.
Vaughan, Esq.&nbsp; The jurisdiction of the court embraces the
following townships, viz.:&mdash;Burlton, Balderton, Eyton,
Fennymere, Frankton, Stanwardine-in-the Field, and Walford.&nbsp;
About four-fifths of the township is tithe free; the residue has
been commuted; the vicarial for &pound;17. 12s., and the rectoral
for &pound;50. 19s., of which &pound;28. 8s. are paid to Messrs.
Shingler and Son, and &pound;22. 11s. to Thomas Bulkeley Bulkeley
Owen, Esq.&nbsp; The manor, tithes, and estate of Burlton were
granted by Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury, in the reign
of William the Conqueror, to the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul,
in Shrewsbury, in the possession of which house it remained till
the dissolution of monastic institutions in the time of Henry
VIII.&nbsp; In the reign of Elizabeth we find it possessed by one
Griffith.&nbsp; It then passed to the family of Lawley, of whom
was Sir Edward Lawley, K.B., who, dying, left an only daughter,
named Ursula.&nbsp; She married, first, Sir Robert Bertie, K.B.,
and secondly, George Penruddock, Esq., who thus became possessed
of Burlton.&nbsp; This gentleman, taking an active part in the
wars of King Charles <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>and the Parliament, and being a
zealous royalist, his manor, as did many others in the kingdom,
changed its owner, and became the property of Captain Arthur
Chambre, in whose family it has remained to the present time, and
now belongs to his descendant, Robert Chambre Vaughan, Esq., who
resides at <span class="smcap">Burlton Hall</span>, a very
ancient mansion, embosomed in foliage.&nbsp; The greater part of
the hall was built about the year 1420; having become much

<h4>MIDDLE</h4>
<p>is a considerable parish, partly in the Ellesmere division of
the hundred of Pimhill, and partly in the Albrighton division,
the former comprehending within its bounds the townships of
Balderton, Marton, Middle, and part of Sleap; and the latter the
chapelry of Hadnal, which consists of the several townships of
Alderton, Hadnal, Haston, Hardwick, Shotton, and Smethcott.&nbsp;
The entire parish contains 6,902<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 27<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land.&nbsp; Mostly a fertile soil, it presents a fine
agricultural district, with an undulating surface, interspersed
with woods and plantations, and every agreeable feature in
landscape beauty.&nbsp; The woods and plantations cover 55<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 19<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land.&nbsp; The parish includes the
celebrated eminences of Pimhill and Harmour Hill, from whence a
most delightful and varied prospect of the country is seen.&nbsp;
In 1801 there was a population of 1,141 souls; in 1831, 1,205;
and in 1841, 1,330 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;4,943.&nbsp; The Duke of Cleveland and the trustees of the
late Duke of Bridgewater are joint lords of the manor.&nbsp; The
village of Middle is pleasantly situated on an acclivity of red
sand-stone <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>rock, on the line of the Shrewsbury, Chester,
Ellesmere, and Holyhead turnpike roads.&nbsp; These roads are,
however, now but little traversed, the railroads having diverted
the greatest portion of the traffic.&nbsp; There are some good
houses in the village, which has a straggling appearance; and in
the immediate vicinity there are several respectable family
residences.&nbsp; The township contains 2,179<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 15<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, the soil of which in some parts
is a cold clay, in other parts it is more fertile.&nbsp; In 1841
there were 87 houses and 456 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;2,240.&nbsp; The principal landowners are the trustees of
the late Viscount Alford, William Henry Bickerton, Esq., William
Teece, Esq., Mr. John Chilton, Mr. Edward Birch, Edward Edwards,
Esq., and J. A. Lloyd, Esq.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Middle Castle</span>.&mdash;Of this
ancient baronial fortress there are but few vestiges
remaining.&nbsp; Lord John L&rsquo;Estrange, in the time of
Edward I., obtained licence to make a castle of his house at
Middle, which lay less exposed to the incursions of the Welsh
than his castles of Knockin and Ruyton.&nbsp; The castle was two
stories high, with a flat roof, and some part of the walls were
remaining about the year 1640.&nbsp; These were in a great
measure destroyed by an earthquake in 1688.&nbsp; It was a
quadrangular structure, with a square court inside, and was
surrounded by a moat.&nbsp; The moat is yet very perfect, and
filled with water; but the castle is completely demolished,
except a tower and a few fragments of the walls.&nbsp; These
existing vestiges were recently put in a state of repair, by
order of the late Viscount Alford.&nbsp; On the east side of the
castle, there was a piece of ground of about half an acre,
surrounded by a moat.&nbsp; The entrance to this piece was by a
gatehouse, which stood near the north-east corner of the castle
moat, and near it was a drawbridge over the moat.&nbsp; In the
3rd of Edward III., John L&rsquo;Estrange had a grant of free
warren, the view of frankpledge and waif, in this manor.&nbsp; A
settlement made by Richard L&rsquo;Estrange may be found in the
chancery rolls in the 18th of Henry VI.&nbsp; After the death of
this family it descended to the Derby family, and William Dod was
appointed constable or keeper; and after him Sir Roger Kynaston
was, by commission, keeper of Middle and Knockin castles.&nbsp;
Upon the decease of Sir Roger, his son Humphrey (who, from his
dissolute and riotous mode of life, was called Wild Humphrey) was
tenant here.&nbsp; On his being outlawed, he left Middle Castle,
which he had suffered to become ruinous, and went and took up his
abode in a cave, near Nesscliff, which to this day is called
Kynaston&rsquo;s cave.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, which is dedicated to
St. Peter, was rebuilt about a century ago, with the exception of
the tower, which was erected in the year 1634.&nbsp; It consists
of two aisles and a chancel, and exhibits the debased style of
English architecture.&nbsp; Two handsome windows were put into
the chancel about a year ago, in the decorated style, at the
expense of Mrs. Egerton, widow of the late rector, the Rev.
Thomas Egerton, to whose memory the east one is dedicated.&nbsp;
The windows are richly beautified with stained glass, by Wailes,
of Newcastle.&nbsp; There are several neat memorials in the
church to the Atcherleys, Bickertons, Kynastons, and
others.&nbsp; It is neatly pewed with oak sittings, and the whole
has a chaste and orderly appearance.&nbsp; The living is a
rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;12. 7s.
3&frac12;d., now returned at &pound;1,003, in the patronage of
the trustees of the late Viscount Alford, and enjoyed by the Rev.
George Henry Egerton, M.A., who resides at the Rectory, a
delightfully situated mansion, beautified with pleasure grounds
and shrubberies.&nbsp; The rectory was rebuilt in 1747, by Dr.
Egerton Leigh, the then rector.&nbsp; Subsequent additions have
from time to time been made.&nbsp; The tithes have been commuted
for &pound;345. 19s. 6d.&nbsp; There is a <span
class="smcap">Parochial and Infant School</span> in Middle, in
which upwards of 100 children are educated.&nbsp; They are
chiefly supported by the rector, by whom the infant school was
established.&nbsp; The Middle Friendly and Benefit Society has
107 enrolled members, and a capital stock of &pound;675. 15s.
11d.; besides which, there is the Middle Old Friendly Society,
and a branch of the Oddfellows, which have a considerable number
of members.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>William
Gough</i>, in 1669, devised his lands, subject to the payment of
&pound;5 per annum, on the 25th of December, to the minister and
churchwardens of Middle, to be <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>applied in putting forth poor
children apprentices.&nbsp; <i>Richard Newton</i> left a rent
charge of 12s., issuing out of the Newton estate, to be given in
bread to the poor on the second Sunday in the month.&nbsp; This
gift, and the yearly sum of 25s., paid out of the
poor&rsquo;s-rate, are applied in the purchase of bread, and
distributed every Sunday.&nbsp; This 25s. is supposed to be paid
as the interest of some charity money applicable to this purpose,
and carried to the account of the parish.&nbsp; The same sum has
been paid from the year 1786.&nbsp; <i>Thomas Atcherley</i>, by
will, 1680, devised a rent charge of 24s. per annum, payable out
of certain lands in Baschurch parish, to be given to the poor of
Middle on Easter Monday.&nbsp; There is a plot of land,
consisting of about three-fourths of an acre, which is let for
30s. per annum, and the amount is distributed by the
churchwardens every Easter Monday, with the sum of 16s. 6d., paid
from the parish-rates, as the interest of money supposed to have
been given for charitable uses, and carried to the account of the
parish.&nbsp; There are ten other bequests, which are stated to
be vested in the parish, amounting altogether to &pound;70.&nbsp;
If the &pound;24 paid for the purchase of the above mentioned
land be deducted from that sum, there will remain &pound;46,
which is supposed to have been taken to the account of the
parish, and for which the two sums of &pound;1. 5s. and 16s. 6d.,
paid as above stated, would be interest at 4&frac12; per
cent.</p>
<p>The <i>Rev. Thomas Watkins</i> left to the poor of this parish
not receiving parochial relief, the sum of &pound;20.&nbsp;
<i>Richard Watkins</i> left &pound;30 for the like purpose.&nbsp;
<i>John Mansell</i> gave &pound;10 to the poor.&nbsp; The three
sums above mentioned amounting to &pound;60, are secured on the
Ellesmere House of Industry, by bond, bearing date 19th February,
1793.&nbsp; The interest is distributed among the most
necessitous poor of the parish.&nbsp; The poor are entitled to
partake of the benefit of <i>Dame Mary Hill&rsquo;s</i> charity,
noticed with the chapelry of Hadnal.&nbsp; <i>Francis Henry Earl
of Bridgewater</i>, by his will, bearing date August 29th, 1828,
gave to the overseers and churchwardens of the parish of Middle
&pound;2,000, to be laid out by them in the public funds, and the
dividends thereof to be expended by the rector for the time being
for the benefit and relief of the poor of Middle, including
Hadnal.&nbsp; The dividends amount to &pound;65 per annum, which
is chiefly appropriated by the present rector to a clothing club,
the poor receiving the addition of the charity to their
savings.</p>

&pound;380; in the patronage of Earl Powis, and incumbency of the
Rev. George Arthur dive, M.A.; curate, Rev. John Norgreave
Baker.&nbsp; The following account of Shrawardine is copied from
an old parish register book, now in the possession of the
curate:&mdash;&ldquo;In the time of our unnatural broil and
unhappy wars that were between the king and his parliament,
Shrawardine Castle was made a garrison for the king, September
28th, 1644.&nbsp; Sir William Vaughan, colonel, was made governor
of it.&nbsp; This garrison was the head quarters of all his
forces.&nbsp; Whilst this garrison continued the church and
chancel were pulled down; the outbuildings of the castle, the
parsonage house, with all edifices thereto belonging, and the
greatest, fairest, and best part of the town were burnt, for the
safety, as it was pretended, of the garrison.&nbsp; In this
firing, the register book, with many books of the minister, were
burned.&nbsp; Shrawardine chancel was thrown down on St.
Matthias&rsquo; day, February 24th, 1644.&nbsp; The church was
pulled down on Whit Sunday eve, June 8th, 1645.&nbsp; The town
was burnt on Midsummer eve and Midsummer day, 1645.&nbsp; The
garrison was cowardly surrendered up to the parliament forces
under the command of Colonel Hunt, Colonel Lloyd, and Mr.
Charlton, after five days&rsquo; siege; and within less than a
fortnight after all the timber of the castle, and much goods that
were in it, were all consumed with fire, upon a sudden report
that Sir William Vaughan was coming to surprise it.&nbsp;
Afterwards the stone work was pulled down, and carried to
Shrewsbury for the repairing of the castle there, and the making
of Rousal wall, standing on the Severn side.&nbsp; The church was
re-built by a voluntary collection through the county, in the
year 1649.&nbsp; In the meanwhile the parishioners assembled for
the worship of God in the castle stables.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
chancel of the church was rebuilt in 1722.&nbsp; Oliver Cromwell,
shortly after the castle was taken, ordered its destruction, at
which period he dismantled and destroyed a great number of the
ancient baronial fortresses.&nbsp; The castle stood near to the
church; the remains of it consist of mere fragments of mortar and
rough stones.&nbsp; It was anciently the seat of the Fitz Alans,
and subsequently of the Bromleys.&nbsp; It is now the property of
Earl Powis, who is also a considerable owner of land in this
district.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Hall Farm House</span> is
an ancient structure, occupied by Mr. James Crane.&nbsp; The farm
premises have been newly erected, upon a commodious and
conveniently arranged plan.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Shrawardine
Castle</span> is a modern building of red freestone, and being
situated on elevated ground, commands a most delightful and
picturesque view of the adjacent country.&nbsp; There is a fine
sheet of water, covering several acres of <a

the vicinity of the castle.&nbsp; The castle farm contains 506
acres.&nbsp; The farm premises are of considerable extent, most
admirably arranged, and furnished with all the modern appliances
for agricultural purposes.&nbsp; Thomas Bowen, Esq., is now the
occupant.&nbsp; <i>Joseph Jones</i>, by his will, bearing date
30th September, 1729, reciting that he had in his hands &pound;30
belonging to the poor of Shrawardine, which was intrusted to him
by the family of Bromley, of Holt Castle, to be put out to
interest, and the amount yearly expended in coals for the
poor.&nbsp; Mr. Jones, to secure the legacy, charged certain
premises with the payment of 30s. per annum, and this amount is
now paid out of an estate which was subsequently given by Mr.
Jones to the poor of Atcham, subject to the above
rent-charge.</p>

<h2>THE NORTH BRADFORD HUNDRED.</h2>
<p>The hundred of North Bradford is bounded on the north by
Cheshire, on the east by Staffordshire, on the west by the
hundred of Pimhill and the Albrighton division, and on the south
by the hundred of South Bradford.&nbsp; There is a considerable
extent of land in this hundred which is highly fertile, and the
cheese, which is extensively made, is said to be quite equal in
quality to the celebrated Cheshire cheese in the adjoining
county.&nbsp; The soils are various.&nbsp; The meadow lands in
general produce a rich herbage, and the arable lands are seen
covered with luxuriant crops of grain.&nbsp; The scenery is rich
and beautiful, and in some places highly picturesque.&nbsp; The
land in most parts is pleasingly diversified with gentle
undulations, and in some places there are considerable
inequalities of surface and bold swells, interspersed with rising
plantations and woody scenery, which add to the beauty of the
prospects.&nbsp; In this hundred is found superior clay for
making bricks, marl for improving the land, and peat or turf for
firing.&nbsp; The hundred is divided into the Drayton Division,
Wem Division, and Whitchurch Division, and at the census of 1841
contained 5,428 inhabited houses, 204 uninhabited, and 26 houses
building, with a population of 27,971 souls.</p>
<p><i>The Drayton Division</i> contains the parishes and
townships of Adderley, Bearstone, Betton, Betchley, Bolas Little,
Cheswardine, Chipnall, Childs Ercall, Drayton Magna, Drayton

<h3>ADDERLEY</h3>
<p>is a parish and small rural village, four miles N.N.W. from
Market Drayton, which contains 3,938<span class="smcap">a</span>.
2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 38<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land, and comprehends the townships of Adderley, The Morrey,
Spoonley, and part of Shavington.&nbsp; In 1801 there were 365 <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>inhabitants
in the parish; in 1831, 468; and in 1841, 64 houses and 404
inhabitants.&nbsp; The township of Adderley, in 1841, contained
48 houses and 297 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;3,096. 10s.&nbsp; Though now an inconsiderable village, it
was in early times of sufficient importance to become a market
town.&nbsp; In the 9th of Edward II., Bartholomew Badlesmere had
a charter for keeping a market on a Thursday, at his manor of
Adderley, and a fair on the eve, and the day and the morrow after
the feast of St. Peter and St. Paul, with the privilege of free
warren.&nbsp; The manor and estate were afterwards carried in
marriage to William Lord Roos, who died in the Holy Land, without
issue.&nbsp; Thomas Lord Roos died on his journey thither.&nbsp;
John Lord Roos died on his journey to Jerusalem.&nbsp; His son,
Thomas Lord Roos, for his fidelity to the Lancasterian interest,
was attainted in the parliament 1st of Edward IV., and the manor
was seized by the king.&nbsp; Richard Corbet, Esq., and the Earl
of Kilmorey are the principal landowners.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span> is a neat structure, dedicated to
St. Peter, and consists of nave, chancel, transept, and side
chapel.&nbsp; The tower is dated 1732, and the body of the church
was rebuilt in 1801.&nbsp; On the north side is the Kilmorey
chapel and family vault, the windows of which are ornamented with
armorial bearings in stained glass.&nbsp; There are several neat
tablets in memory of this family, one of which contains the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Sacred to the memories
of<br />
Robert Viscount Kilmorey and Frances Viscountess Kilmorey,<br />
daughter of Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton, Bart., of Combermere
Abbey.<br />
Their conjugal felicity, during an union of twenty-seven
years,<br />
knew no interruption, felt no decline.<br />
The blow which severed them on earth<br />
was mercifully healed by an early reunion in heaven;<br />
and their mortal remains were together consigned<br />
to the vault beneath, on the 7th day of December,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A.D. M,DCCCXVIII.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a brass plate, with representations of one of
the Earls of Kilmorey, his lady, and the figures of seven boys
and two girls, in fine preservation, dated 1556; near to which is
another brass plate, with the mutilated figure of a person in
priestly vestments.&nbsp; The church-yard is ornamented with
several fine yew trees, and the ancient font has been placed in
the church-yard, and converted into a sun dial.&nbsp; The living
is a rectory, in the patronage of the Cotton family, and
incumbency of the Rev. William Cotton.&nbsp; The Rev. Leonard
Slater is the officiating curate, and resides at the Rectory; a
good residence, a little north from the church.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Adderley Hall</span>, a handsome stuccoed mansion,
with centre and wings, is approached by a noble portico, and is
the seat and property of Richard Corbet, Esq.&nbsp; It is
beautified with pleasure grounds and shrubberies, and stands in a
well wooded park, ornamented with a fine sheet of water.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>The Rev. Robert
Adams</i>, in 1719, devised certain lands, in trust, for
charitable uses, which then produced a yearly income of
&pound;13. 12s. per annum.&nbsp; The donor directed &pound;8 to
be paid by the rector, vicar, and churchwardens of Muccleston,
Adderley, and Drayton, alternately, on the 25th of March every
year, for the setting a poor boy or girl yearly apprentice; the
yearly sum of 30s. to be paid for the instruction of children in
Adderley; the same sum for the like purpose in Muccleston; and
the sum of 52s. to be expended in bread, and distributed to the
poor who should attend divine service in the parish of
Adderley.&nbsp; The estate now produces a yearly income of
&pound;35. 12s.; and the whole of the clear rents, since 1815,
have been applied to the charitable uses mentioned in the
will.&nbsp; The same person also bequeathed &pound;20, to be
placed out at interest, and distributed among the poor of the
parish of Adderley.&nbsp; There is no evidence to show how this
legacy has been applied.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Reynolds</i>, in 1725, devised a messuage at
Walkerton, near Wybunbury, in Cheshire, to apply one moiety of
the rents and profits thereof, for the benefit of the poor <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>of
Adderley; and the other moiety among the poor of
Dodcot-cum-Wilksley, in the parish of Audlem.&nbsp; The premises
at Walkerton were subsequently sold for &pound;1,050; and in 1814
the amount was placed in the hands of Sir Corbet Corbet, on the
security of a messuage in Staffordshire-street, Market Drayton,
and certain lands situated in Betton-lane, subject to redemption
on the payment of &pound;1,050, and lawful interest for the
same.&nbsp; The yearly sum of &pound;42 is now received from the
trustees, under the will of Sir Corbet Corbet, by the
churchwardens of Adderley, and one half is transmitted to the
overseers of Dodcott-cum-Wilksley; and the other moiety is
distributed among the poor of this parish, in sums varying from
5s. to 10s.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Viscount Kilmorey</i>, by will, 1766, charged his
whole estate with the payment of &pound;1 per month, to be laid
out in bread, and distributed among the poor every first Sunday
in the month, in the parish church of Adderley.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Clayton</i>, in 1760, left &pound;100, and directed
the interest to be expended in bread for the benefit of the
poor.&nbsp; This money was invested in the purchase of
&pound;131. 7s. 3d. three per cent. consols, and the dividends,
amounting to &pound;3. 18s. 8d., are applied by the churchwardens
in the purchase of bread, which is distributed every third Sunday
in the month amongst seven poor widows.</p>

259</span>CHESWARDINE</h3>
<p>is a parish and village delightfully situated near the N.E.
verge of the county, four miles S.S.E. from Market Drayton.&nbsp;
The parish comprehends the townships of Cheswardine, Chipnall,
Goldstone, Sambrook, and Sowdley, and contains 5,723<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 4<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land.&nbsp; In 1801 there was a
population of 628 souls; 1830, 1051, and in 1841, 1015.&nbsp; The
township of Cheswardine contains 1,715<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 10<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and in 1841 had 71 houses and
367 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;2,989. 10s.
9d.&nbsp; In the time of King Henry II. Cheswardine was held by
John L&rsquo;Estrange by knight&rsquo;s service, and in the 32nd
of Edward I. Roger L&rsquo;Estrange had the grant of a market to
be held on a Monday, and a fair on the eve, the day, and the day
after the translation of St. Swithin.&nbsp; Sir John Mainwaring,
knight, was keeper of the park of Cheswarthyn in the 13th of
Edward IV.&nbsp; The church is an ancient structure, dedicated to
St. Swithin, and consists of nave, chancel, and side aisles, with
a tower, in which are six musical bells, which were put up, and
also a new clock, about two years ago; from the summit of the
tower a most extensive and beautiful prospect of the country is
seen.&nbsp; The clock and the bells were purchased with money
raised by voluntary subscriptions, and the gallery on the west
side of the church was erected at the joint expense of John
Butter, of Sowdley Park; William Butter, of Chipnall, and Richard
Meeson, of Little Sowdley.&nbsp; There is a mural tablet in
memory of the Rev. Samuel Orpe, who was vicar of this parish for
56 years; he died in 1724, aged 86 years.&nbsp; A small memorial
of brass remembers Gabriel Lloyd, who died in the year 1623, and
another brass plate states that Richard Jervis died in the year
1688.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;5. 6s. 8d., now returned at &pound;260, in the
patronage of T. Smallwood, Esq.; the Rev. Charles Miller is the
officiating curate.&nbsp; This church was anciently held by the
abbot of Haughmond, having been given to the Abbey by John
L&rsquo;Estrange in the time of Henry II.&nbsp; He also gave to
the abbey the mill at Cheswarthyn, with the appurtenances.&nbsp;
Queen Elizabeth, in the 26th of her reign, devised the tithes of
the parish to Richard Corbet, Esq.&nbsp; On the western verge of
the parish there is an open common, covering an area of about 100
acres.&nbsp; The Shropshire Union Canal intersects the parish,
taking its course through some deep cuttings about a mile west
from the church; on the banks of the canal there is a wharf
called the Goldstone Wharf.&nbsp; The National School for boys
was built in 1838; there is also a girl&rsquo;s school, which was
erected in 1738.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;The girls&rsquo;
school was originally built by Richard Smithiman, and in 1738 it
was rebuilt by the parishioners.</p>
<p><i>Richard Meeson</i>, in 1712, left the yearly sum of
&pound;4, to be applied by the ministers and churchwardens of the
parish, as an additional salary to the schoolmaster there, for
instructing four poor boys in the English tongue, for so many
years as the minister and churchwardens should think fit.</p>
<p><i>John Sawdley</i> left to the poor of this parish
&pound;100.&nbsp; The churchwardens have been in possession of
several closes at Foxbrook, in the parish of Dilhorne, in
Staffordshire, from the year 1721.&nbsp; Altogether there are
about ten acres, and it would appear from entries in the
churchwarden&rsquo;s book, that this property was purchased with
the legacy above mentioned, but the purchase deeds are not now in
the possession of the parishioners.&nbsp; The land is let at a
yearly rent of &pound;12.</p>
<p>Several sums of money, amounting in the whole to &pound;172,
left at different periods, and by various donors, were held by
the churchwardens in trust for the poor of the parish, previous
to 1754; in that year the sum of &pound;155 was laid out in the
purchase of an estate in the parish of Hinstock, comprising
between eight and nine acres, which now produces a yearly income
of &pound;20.&nbsp; The rents of the above two charities are
received by the churchwardens, and the amount, with the produce
of other charities, is given away on the Friday before the first
of July, and on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, in wheat to the poor
parishioners in quantities varying from two gallons to a
bushel.</p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span><i>Richard Jervis</i>, by will, 24th July, 1688, gave
to the poor of Cheswardine parish &pound;10, to be disposed of at
the discretion of his executors.&nbsp; The yearly sum of 10s. has
been paid in respect of this legacy.&nbsp; The last payment was
made by Cresswell Pigott, Esq., as executor of Henry Z. Jervis,
who was the personal representative of the donor.&nbsp; For two
years previous to the Charity Commissioners publishing their
report nothing had been received, in consequence of a suit in the
Court of Chancery having been instituted respecting the estate of
Mr. Jervis.&nbsp; An affidavit was sworn by one of the
churchwardens in support of a claim to this legacy.</p>
<p><i>Francis Butler</i>, by will, 1694, gave a rent charge of
&pound;2 10s. per annum for the benefit of the poor of
Cheswardine parish.&nbsp; The property from which this gift is
payable is situate in the township of Chipnall, and was part of
the estate of the late Henry Zachariah Jervis, whose property
became the subject of a suit in the Court of Chancery, as already
mentioned.</p>
<p>In the parliamentary returns of 1786 it is stated that Sarah
Sambrook left 2s. 2d. per month, to be given to the poor in
bread.&nbsp; A distribution of bread takes place on the first
Sunday in every month, in respect of this charity, and the
amount, &pound;1. 6s. per annum, is paid by the owner of Sowdley
Park farm, upon which the payment appears to be charged.</p>
<p>In the parish books in which the distribution of charities is
entered from 1721 to 1767, there is a memorandum stating that
John Butter gave to the poor of this parish three dozen of bread
on Good Friday, in respect of the legacy left by John Bold, of
Great Sawdley.&nbsp; The last entry to this effect is in 1760,
and we have not met with any proof of bread having been
distributed on Good Friday since that time.</p>
<p><i>William Goodall</i>, who died in 1808, left &pound;10 to
the poor of the parish, and John Goodall, who died in 1826, left
the like sum for the same purpose; 20s., the interest of these
legacies, are expended in bread and given amongst the most
deserving poor.</p>
<p>There is an estate in Sowdley, the rents of which have been
applied from time immemorial in aid of the church rate.&nbsp; The
estate consists of two closes called Denway Croft and Ames Field,
and two other closes containing altogether about eight acres and
a half, which is let at a yearly rental of &pound;14. 14s.&nbsp;
There are also two cottages, with gardens, let by the overseers
for the use of poor persons, at the yearly rental of
&pound;3.&nbsp; The rents are applied in aid of the church rates,
and in paying the interest of &pound;150 borrowed towards the
erection of the new church.</p>

<h3>DRAYTON-IN-HALES, <span class="GutSmall">OR</span> MARKET
DRAYTON,</h3>
<p>is a parish and considerable market town, in the Drayton
division of the North Bradford Hundred, 153 miles N.W. by N. from
London, 19 miles N.E. by N. from Shrewsbury, 11 miles N. from
Newport, and 12 miles S.E. from Whitchurch.&nbsp; The town is
pleasantly situated on the north-east extremity of the county,
and is watered by the river Tern.&nbsp; It is a place of great
antiquity; and, according to Nennius, was one of the principal
cities of the ancient Britons.&nbsp; From the discovery of
foundations, and other traces of buildings in the fields
adjoining the town, it is probable that its extent was once more
considerable than at present; and though no coins, pavements, or
other monuments of antiquity have been discovered here, it is
nevertheless strongly conjectured that this town was the Roman
Station, <span class="smcap">Mediolanum</span>.&nbsp; It is still
a place of importance, and the head of a division of the county,
in which the petty sessions are held.&nbsp; It contains several
good inns, and many respectable shops in all the different
branches of the retail trade.&nbsp; There are three firms engaged
in the manufacture of hair seating, which together employ about
two hundred operatives.&nbsp; The manufacture of paper was
formerly carried on to some extent, but was discontinued about
five years ago.&nbsp; Here is a tannery, ironfoundery, and
agricultural implements are extensively made.&nbsp; The various
handicraft trades, in which a considerable number of the
population are employed, will be seen on reference to the
directory.&nbsp; The general traffic of this locality is
facilitated by the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, which
passes on the eastern side of the town.&nbsp; Drayton is twice
mentioned in the Domesday survey, and it was then held by
knights&rsquo; service under Earl Roger.&nbsp; In the <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>30th of
Henry III. the Abbot of Combermere had a grant of a market here
on a Wednesday, and a fair on the eve, the day, and the day after
the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.&nbsp; The market is
still held on Wednesdays, and numerously attended by the farmers
who reside in the surrounding district, when considerable
quantities of grain are sold.&nbsp; Fairs are held on the first
Wednesday in February, Wednesday before Palm Sunday, first
Wednesday in May, Wednesday before June 22nd, first Wednesday in
August, September 19th, October 24th, and the last Wednesday in
November.&nbsp; The parish comprehends the townships of Betton,
Drayton Magna, Drayton Parva, Longslow, Sutton and Woodseaves, in
this county; it also extends into the Pirehill hundred, in the
county of Stafford, and is divided into four quarters for
parochial purposes, viz.:&mdash;Church quarter, containing
Drayton Magna and Drayton Parva; the north quarter, containing
Betton, Ridgewardine, and Tunstall; south quarter, Longslow,
Sutton, and Woodseaves; and Tirley quarter, containing Almington,
Blore, Hales, and Tirley.&nbsp; The entire parish, in 1801,
contained a population of 3,162 souls; 1831, 3,882; and in 1841,
4,680 souls.&nbsp; It embraces 7,726<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 11<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land.&nbsp; The township of <span class="smcap">Drayton
Magna</span> contains 678<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 35<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
and at the census of 1841 had 361 houses and 1,699
inhabitants.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Richard Corbet,
Esq., P. Sillitoe, Esq., the Earl of Powis, William Church
Norcop, Esq., Thomas Whitfield, Esq., and John E. Wilson,
Esq.&nbsp; The former is lord of the manor, and impropriator of
the rectoral tithes, which are commuted for &pound;51. 5s.
9d.&nbsp; The vicarial tithes are commuted for &pound;40. 19s.
9d.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Drayton Parva</span> is a populous
district, forming a western suburb to the town, chiefly
consisting of cottage residences, many of which are small,
ill-ventilated, and have a miserable appearance.&nbsp; At the
census of 1841 there were 352 houses and 1,462 inhabitants.&nbsp;
The township contains 520<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 32<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land.&nbsp; Among the principal landowners are Thomas Whitfield,
Esq., and Mr. Brocklehurst.&nbsp; Richard Corbet, Esq., and Peter
Broughton, Esq., are joint lords of the manor.&nbsp; Mr. Benjamin
Beeston, Mr. William Godwin, and Mr. Samuel Swinnerton, are also
landowners; besides whom there are upwards of one hundred and
fifty small freeholders.&nbsp; Little Drayton Common, containing
97<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>.
36<span class="smcap">p</span>., was enclosed in 1850, when five
acres were allotted for the site of the new church, the
parsonage, and the burial ground.&nbsp; The rectoral tithes have
been commuted for &pound;54. 19s. 7d., and the vicarial for
&pound;21. 13s. 1d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Mary,
is a massive structure, void of architectural beauty, consisting
of nave, chancel, and side aisles, with a castellated tower,
supported by butresses.&nbsp; It was built in the reign of King
Stephen, and underwent a complete reparation in 1786, when it was
stripped of its gothic honours.&nbsp; But little of the original
structure remains; the pillars and arches which separate the nave
from the side aisles are undoubtedly the most ancient part of the
building.&nbsp; The approach is at the west end, under a tower,
by a Norman doorway, ornamented in the zig-zag style; the
ornaments and clustered pillars are, however, much corroded by
time.&nbsp; The tower, with the exception of a small portion at
the bottom, appears to have been wholly rebuilt.&nbsp; On a beam
in the belfry there is the date 1590, but there is no historical
record to show that the tower was rebuilt in that year.&nbsp;
There are six musical bells; the tenor bell, weighing 17&frac12;
cwt., was added about five years ago.&nbsp; The interior is
spacious and lofty, and provided with commodious galleries.&nbsp;
Upon the gallery at the west end is a small organ.&nbsp; Each
side aisle is divided from the nave by five pointed arches rising
from octagonal pillars, the ornamental portions of which have
been defaced.&nbsp; In the centre aisle is a capacious font, of
an octagonal form.&nbsp; The east window is richly beautified
with stained glass, which was added about twenty-five years ago,
at the expense of Sir Andrew Corbet.&nbsp; An antique tablet
remembers Dame Anne Corbet, who died in 1682, aged 80
years.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was the mother of ten sons and ten
daughters, whereof seventeen lived to be men and
women.&rdquo;&nbsp; The walls of the chancel and side aisles are
ornamented with numerous other tablets in memory of members of
some of the principal families resident in this neighbourhood,
but which our limits will not allow us to notice; several of
modern erection are <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>very beautifully designed.&nbsp;
There was a chantery in this church, founded by Ralph de Basset
in the 14th of Edward I., for three chaplains, who had three
acres of land here.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;12. 10s. 7&frac12;d., now returned at
&pound;173, in the patronage of Richard Corbet, Esq., and
incumbency of the Rev. James Lee, M.A.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Vicarage</span>, a neat residence a little west
from the church, was erected in 1837, at a cost of &pound;1,000,
by the present incumbent.&nbsp; The old vicarage stood near the
west end of the church, and was taken down when the present
edifice was built.&nbsp; The site and the garden, measuring about
half an acre, were sold by the vicar to the parishioners for the
sum of &pound;400, and were added to the church-yard.&nbsp; The
church stands considerably elevated, and is a conspicuous and
imposing object when seen from the Newport road, the southern
approach to the town.&nbsp; The church-yard commands a fine
prospect towards the south.&nbsp; Immediately before you is an
abrupt declevity, with cottages nestling under the cliff; the
meanderings of the Tern water the fertile meadows beneath; and on
the opposite acclivity is seen the beautiful seat of Purney
Sillitoe, Esq., embosomed in thriving plantations with a fine
extent of richly-wooded country extending into Staffordshire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The New Church</span>, situated on Little
Drayton Common, is dedicated to our Saviour, and was built in
1846.&nbsp; It is a neat structure, in the early English style of
architecture, with nave, chancel, and side aisles, with a tower
at the north-west corner.&nbsp; The interior has a chaste and
pleasing appearance, and will accommodate about six hundred
worshippers.&nbsp; The sittings are uniform in character, and are
all free, with the exception of forty.&nbsp; The total cost of
the structure was &pound;2,600, of which Mrs. Nonelly gave the
munificent sum of &pound;500, and a like sum towards the erection
of a residence for the minister.&nbsp; The parsonage stands a
little south from the church, and was built in 1847, on the five
acres of land given for the site of the church and
parsonage.&nbsp; About an acre and a half has been enclosed for a
burial ground, and the rest is appropriated as gardens and
pleasure grounds to the parsonage.&nbsp; The living is a
perpetual curacy, in the patronage of the Vicar of Drayton;
incumbent, Rev. Edward Cheere, M.A.&nbsp; The district of this
church comprises Little Drayton, the township of Sutton, and part
of Woodseaves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span>, a plain
brick structure, situated in Back-lane, was built in the year
1778.&nbsp; It is neatly fitted up and provided with
galleries.&nbsp; The congregation had no settled pastor when our
agent visited Drayton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel</span>,
situated in Shropshire-street, within the bounds of the township
of Little Drayton, was built in the year 1808.&nbsp; The
structure is plain, is provided with a gallery, and will
accommodate between four and five hundred people.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Baptist Chapel</span>, a small
structure, situate at Little Drayton, has a residence
attached.&nbsp; There is no baptist minister residing here, but
members of this persuasion meet for worship every alternate
Sunday.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Primitive Methodists</span> have a
small chapel, situated a little back from Cheshire-street.&nbsp;
This is the only place of worship in the town,&mdash;too small
for the number of hearers who attend religious service.&nbsp; It
is expected a new chapel will shortly be built.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Free Grammar School</span>, situated
on the south-east side of the church yard, was founded by Sir
Rowland Hill, in 1554, who charged the manor at Wellington Hey,
with the lands thereto belonging, with the payment of &pound;22
per annum, for the support of the said school.&nbsp; The
churchwardens of the parish were incorporated governors of the
school, and were directed to pay twenty marks yearly out of the
above sum to the master, to the usher &pound;6. 13s. 4d., and the
yearly sum of 40s. residue thereof should be kept as a fund for
the reparations of the school.&nbsp; The governors covenanted for
themselves and their successors that the hall or tenement on the
south side of the church yard at Drayton, commonly called St.
Mary&rsquo;s Hall, wherein a grammar school was then kept, or
such other house as should be thereafter erected on the site,
should be for ever used for the said grammar school.&nbsp; The
school was to be free for all children whose parents should place
<a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>them
there for learning to read English, the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew
languages, and that neither the master nor the usher should agree
for any recompense for such instruction.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Lake,
in 1662, gave a rent charge issuing out of certain lands in the
parish of Baschurch, amounting to &pound;9. 19s. per annum,
&pound;6. 12s. 8d. thereof to the schoolmaster, and &pound;3. 6s.
4d. to the usher.&nbsp; By an order in the Court of Chancery made
22nd January, 1816, on a petition presented by the governors it
was ordered that the offices of master and usher should be
consolidated, and that the office of usher should be
abolished.&nbsp; That the governors should be at liberty to
expend a sum not exceeding &pound;191 in repairing the school
house and other buildings belonging to the school; and that such
sum should be raised by a mortgage of the said premises.&nbsp;
That the governors should let the house then occupied by the
usher.&nbsp; That a salary of &pound;25 should be paid to the
master, and that the residue of the annual revenues of the school
should be applied in discharge of the principal money to be
borrowed for the said repairs, and of the necessary repairs that
might from time to time be wanted.&nbsp; The income of the school
consists of the two rent charges above mentioned, and &pound;7
per annum arising from the rent of the house formerly occupied by
the usher.&nbsp; Out of the income amounting to &pound;38 19s.
there is paid a salary of &pound;25 to the master, &pound;9. 2s.
as interest on the &pound;182 laid out in the repairs of the
school premises, and some small sums annually for repairs and
incidental expenses.&nbsp; The Rev. Charles Cooke, M.A., is the
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Parochial and National School</span>
is a neat brick structure in the Elizabethan style of
architecture, situated on a bold eminence a short distance west
from the church.&nbsp; It was built in the year 1835, and is
supported by annual subscriptions, and small weekly payments
received from the children.&nbsp; There are one hundred and sixty
boys and one hundred and thirty girls now educated in the
school.&nbsp; William Scott is the teacher.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Market Drayton Poor-law Union</span>
comprehends twelve parishes, embracing 61,637 acres of land, and
an area of 91 square miles, with a population returned at the
census of 1841 of 13,925 souls.&nbsp; The Union House, situated
in Shropshire-street, was formerly used as the parish workhouse;
it was enlarged by the poor-law guardians in the year 1839; the
average number of inmates is usually about one hundred.&nbsp; A
new Union House will shortly be built upon Little Drayton Common,
which will accommodate about 350 inmates.&nbsp; The district
comprised within the union is the same as that of the county
court, the several places of which are stated here
below:&mdash;<i>Chairman of the Guardians</i>: Thomas Twemlow,
Esq.&nbsp; <i>Vice Chairman</i>: Walter Minor, Esq.&nbsp;

<p><span class="smcap">The County Court Offices</span>, situated
in Cheshire-street, is a neat structure of brick with stone
finishings, and was built in the year 1850, at the expense of
Joseph Loxdale Warren, Esq.&nbsp; The lower part of the building
is used as offices for the despatch of business connected with
the county court, and above is a large room capable of holding
upwards of 400 people, which is used for magisterial
purposes.&nbsp; The court embraces within its jurisdiction the
following townships and places, viz.:&mdash;Adderley, Almington,
Ashley, Aston, Bearston, Betchley, Betton, Blore, Bolas Parva,

<p><span class="smcap">Petty Sessions</span> are held on the last
Saturday in every month, in the spacious room <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>above the
county court offices, when prisoners are committed to Shrewsbury
or Stafford, as the case may occur, in which county the offence
is committed, the magistrates having jurisdiction in both
counties.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Police Office</span> is situated in
Cheshire-street nearly opposite the county court office.&nbsp; It
was built in 1850, and has two cells, where prisoners are
confined before committal by the magistrates.&nbsp; In which case
they are sent to Shrewsbury if the offence has been committed in
this county, and to Stafford if committed in Staffordshire.&nbsp;
Attached to the cells is a residence for the constable; William
Hemming is the police officer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Market Drayton Society for the
Acquirement of Useful Knowledge</span> was established in
September, 1850.&nbsp; The objects of the institution are to
extend to all classes aid for cultivating, and occasion for
exercising their mental powers; to afford to its members the
powerful advantages and incitement of association for prosecuting
their several studies in the various branches of useful
knowledge, and to secure to them opportunity for engaging in such
pursuits as shall tend to their moral as well as intellectual
advancement.&nbsp; For these objects the society has taken
convenient premises situate in the beast market; classes for
mutual improvement have been formed, a library and news room have
been established, and it is intended to have lectures on natural
and experimental philosophy, and the fine arts, as occasion may
occur; the news room is furnished with the principal London and
provincial journals and the most popular periodicals of the day;
and the library, although only recently established, contains
many valuable and standard works.&nbsp; Persons are admitted to
all the privileges of the institution on the payment of 8s. per
annum.&nbsp; An annual subscription of 21s. per annum constitutes
an honorary member, and any person giving the sum of &pound;10.
10s., or books, or apparatus to that amount, or a course of not
less than ten lectures, is considered an honorary member for
life.&nbsp; The honorary members have the exclusive use of the
reading room from nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning till six
o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp; The institution has the
patronage and active support of the principal gentry and clergy
of the town and neighbourhood.&nbsp; <i>Patrons</i>: Henry Bayley
Clive, Esq., M.P.; John Whitehall Dod, Esq., M.P.&nbsp;
<i>President</i>: Thomas Twemlow, Esq.&nbsp; <i>Treasurer</i>: W.
M. Wilkinson, Esq.&nbsp; <i>Secretary</i>: Mr. William
Crutchley.</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">News Room</span> has been established by
the gentry and tradesmen in the town, at Mrs. Barnett&rsquo;s,
High-street.&nbsp; It is supported by subscriptions of 21s. per
annum.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Gas Works</span> are situated in the
outskirts of the southern side of the town, near the river Tern;
they were established by a company of shareholders, who reside in
Staffordshire, and the town is expected to be lighted with gas
during the autumn of the present year (1851).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Provident Societies</span>.&mdash;There
are in this town several societies or clubs, the members of which
pay small contributions to their respective funds, from which
they are relieved in case of sickness, infirmity, or
superannuation, and from which the friends of deceased members
receive a sufficient sum for their decent interment.&nbsp; Among
these are the Market Drayton Tradesmen Club, and the fraternities
or sacred Orders of Oddfellows, M.U.; Ancient Forresters, and
Female Societies, &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Grove</span> is a handsome brick
mansion, a quarter of a mile east from the church, the residence
and property of John E. Wilson, Esq.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Spring Fields</span>, a good house a little west
from the church, situated on elevated ground, commands fine
prospects of the country, and is the residence and property of
Thomas Whitfield, Esq.</p>
<p>Near this town, during the desolating wars between the houses
of York and Lancaster, a desperate conflict took place at <span
class="smcap">Blore Heath</span>, on the borders of
Staffordshire, which proved very disastrous to numbers of the
Cheshire gentry, and many of the principal families of the
adjoining district.&nbsp; The battle took place on the 23rd of
September, 1459, when Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury,
commanded the forces of the white rose, and had an army of 5,000
men encamped on a hill near Market Drayton.&nbsp; He was opposed
by <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>James
Touchet, Lord Audley, on the part of the red rose, with an army
of 10,000.&nbsp; Though so disproportionate in numbers, the army
of Salisbury proved victorious: 2,400 men are said to have been
slain in this bloody conflict, together with their brave and
loyal chief, who fell by the hand of Robert Kynaston, Esq., of
Hordley, a zealous partizan of the house of York.&nbsp; In a
field adjoining the turnpike road from Market Drayton to
Newcastle, a stone has been set up to mark the spot where Lord
Audley fell.&nbsp; What rendered the battle more calamitous was,
that the principal families ranged nearly in equal numbers on the
side of each of the contending parties.&nbsp; The old English
poet, Michael Drayton, in his &ldquo;Polyalbion,&rdquo;
represents the conflict as partaking of the form of a duel, in
which one relative falls a sacrifice to the resentment of the
other:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There Dutton Dutton kills; a Done doth kill
a Done;<br />
A Booth a Booth; and Leigh by Leigh is overthrown;<br />
A Venables against a Venables doth stand,<br />
A Troutbeck fighteth with a Troutbeck hand to hand;<br />
There Molineux doth make a Molineux to die,<br />
And Egerton the strength of Egerton doth try.<br />
O Cheshire! wert thou mad of thine own native gore,<br />
So much until this day thou never shedd&rsquo;st before;<br />
Above two thousand men upon the earth were thrown,<br />
Of whom the greater part were naturally thine own.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Whitfield, Esq., of Drayton, has in his possession the
crest of the Egertons, a sword handle, and a brass stirrup,
richly ornamented and in good preservation, which were found
about thirty years ago on the field of battle.&nbsp; During the
struggles between Charles I. and the parliament, a skirmish took
place in the neighbourhood of Drayton, between the King&rsquo;s
party, under the command of Prince Rupert, and the parliamentary
forces under the command of Sir Thomas Fairfax, when the royal
cause gained a temporary success.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Market Drayton Savings&rsquo;
Bank</span>, on November 20th, 1850, had a capital stock of
&pound;29,004. 3s., invested with the commissioners for the
reduction of the national debt, at which period there were 866
separate accounts, of which ten were charitable societies, with
deposits amounting to &pound;260. 12s. 1d.; and ten friendly
societies, with deposits amounting to &pound;1,706. 2s. 6d.&nbsp;
Of the total number of deposits, there were 449 whose respective

not exceeding &pound;50; 109 above &pound;50 and not exceeding
&pound;100; 36 above &pound;100 and not exceeding &pound;150; and
29 between that sum and &pound;200.&nbsp; John Moore is the
secretary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Frances
Hill</i>, in 1557, gave a rent charge of 29s. per annum, out of
premises in Castle Donnington, and directed 2s. to be paid yearly
to the vicar or priest of Drayton to say mass in the parish
church, or such divine service as should be lawful to be observed
there; 8d. to the parish clerk, and 16d. to the bell ringers; 2s.
8d. for two wax tapers; 8d. to her heirs for the trouble of
payment; and the residue to be given to the poorest inhabitants
of Drayton.&nbsp; Out of this gift 2s. is paid to the minister,
2s. to the clerk, and to the two churchwardens 8d. each, and the
remainder is distributed among the poor, in groats, on Trinity
Sunday.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Wetenhall</i>, by her will, bearing date 19th
December, 1693, devised to Robert Clive and John Gardner, and
their heirs, two parcels of land at Drayton, called the Gallow
Tree Field and the Clay Pits, which then produced a rental of
&pound;6. 16s. per annum; also a yearly rent of &pound;4, issuing
out a messuage and lands at Winstanwick; and a yearly rent of 8s.
4d. out of a farm at Childs Ercall.&nbsp; And she also bequeathed
to the same persons &pound;60, to be laid out in the purchase of
land, or a rent charge, and out of the yearly proceeds, &pound;4
to be paid in apprenticing one poor boy of the parish of Drayton
to some useful trade; 40s. to be equally distributed among forty
poor widows, or old decayed workmen of Drayton; 20s. to the vicar
of the parish, provided he should preach a sermon on St. <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>Thomas&rsquo;s day; &pound;6. to be paid to Gabriel
Wetenhall and George Dodd, and their heirs and assignees;
&pound;4 for the purpose of putting forth a poor boy of the
parish of Audlem, in Cheshire, apprentice; and 40s. to be
distributed among forty of the poorest widows or decayed
labourers of the said parish.&nbsp; In 1811, an information was
filed against Robert Farbeck and Samuel Redshaw, as the
representatives of the co-heiresses of Robert Clive, the
surviving trustee, and against Richard Grant, who acted as the
trustee of the charity by the attorney-general, at the relation
of the Rev. William Cotton and others.&nbsp; On the 21st of July,
1848, a new scheme for the administration of the charity and
distribution of the income thereof, was made, and certain
trustees appointed.&nbsp; In this scheme the trustees are
ordered, after paying any expenses incident to the administration
of the charity, to divide the income into thirteen parts, and
apply the same in the following manner, viz., four-thirteenths
thereof in apprenticing a poor boy of the parish of Drayton,
selected by the majority of the trustees; two-thirteenths to be
distributed in money, or laid out in the purchase of coals,
blankets, provisions, or clothing, at the discretion of the
trustees, and distributed among forty poor widows, and old
decayed workmen of the parish of Drayton; one-thirteenth to be
paid to the vicar of Drayton, provided he shall have preached, or
cause to be preached, two sermons on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, in
Drayton church; four-thirteenths in apprenticing poor boys of the
parish of Audlam, in Cheshire; and the remaining two thirteenths
to be distributed in money or clothes, among forty poor widows or
decayed labourers of the said parish of Audlem.&nbsp; From
certain technicalities not yet complied with by the legal
gentlemen, and which few can see the reasonableness of but a
lawyer, the charity yet remains in abeyance.&nbsp; The
accumulations amount to upwards of &pound;1,400, out of which
between &pound;400 and &pound;500 had been expended in the
prosecution of the suit up to December, 1850.&nbsp; The trustees
appointed for the administration of the charity by the
attorney-general, July, 1848, are the Rev. George Pitt; Richard
Corbet, Esq.; Henry Clive, Esq.; William Tayleur, Esq.; Thomas
Twemlow, Esq.; William Wilkinson, Esq.; and Richard Grant,
Esq.</p>
<p><i>John Wright</i> left the yearly sum of 10s., to be given in
bread on the feast of St. John the Baptist, and the feast of St.
John the Evangelist: he also left the like sum yearly for the
poor of Tyrley quarter.&nbsp; In respect of this charity, 20s.
per annum is received from certain premises at Stoke-upon-Tern,
which is applied according to the donor&rsquo;s intentions.&nbsp;
<i>Lawrence Thompson</i> left 20s. per annum to the poor of
Drayton, to be given on St. Lawrence&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; <i>Ralph
Kendrirk</i> gave an annual sum of 20s. to the poor, and <i>Mr.
Cooke</i>, a yearly sum of 3s. 4d.&nbsp; These several sums are
carried to the poor&rsquo;s account, and bread distributed to the
amount on New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Richard Price</i>, by will 1730, devised certain
lands and houses in and near Drayton to the poor of Drayton and
Hodnet; viz., &pound;5 per annum, for a distribution of bread
every Lord&rsquo;s-day, and the remainder for the schooling of
poor children of each place.&nbsp; The premises now held by the
parish officers of Drayton, as derived from the Rev. R. Price,
consist of a building in Little Drayton, formerly used as a poor
house.&nbsp; This building was probably erected upon the site of
the five messuages conveyed in trust by the Rev. R. Price; but it
does not appear how the parish of Drayton became entitled to the
whole, as part was allotted to the parish of Hodnet.&nbsp; The
are also two pieces of land, called the Town Field and Crab Tree
Field, and a small plot of land in Longslow lane, which produce a
yearly rental altogether of &pound;19. 11s.&nbsp; This sum is
carried to the general account, kept by the churchwardens,
entitled the Poors&rsquo; Account.</p>
<p><i>John Bill</i> left &pound;240, the interest to be disposed
of in the Shropshire part of the parish.&nbsp; In 1781 the sum of
&pound;240 was lent to Thomas H. Alcock, on his bond, but he
subsequently failing, a dividend of &pound;106 was received from
the bankrupt&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; In 1819 a sum of &pound;190
was advanced by the churchwardens for the repairs of the Grammar
School, for which interest was to be paid at the rate of five per
cent.&nbsp; It is stated in a memorandum, entered in the
churchwardens&rsquo; book, that &pound;118, part of this money
was left by Mr. Bill for <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>the purpose of a charity school in
Little Drayton, and apprenticing poor children, at the discretion
of the churchwardens.&nbsp; Interest is now paid on &pound;182
from the school funds, and the amount is carried to the
poors&rsquo; account; but it may be observed, that in the
application of those funds, only &pound;4 is disposed of annually
for the education of poor children of Little Drayton, which sum
falls short of the income of Price&rsquo;s charity before
mentioned, which is also applicable to this purpose, and nothing
whatever is applied in binding out apprentices.</p>
<p>It appears from a schedule of benefactions, that a great
number of legacies have been left for the benefit of the poor of
this parish.&nbsp; Among the donors is <i>Stephen Denstone</i>,
who gave &pound;100 in 1705, and directed the yearly produce to
be distributed among the poorest widows and housekeepers of Great
and Little Drayton.&nbsp; <i>Richard Heeley</i> gave &pound;100,
and directed half the interest to be expended in bread, and the
other half as the minister and churchwardens of Drayton should
think fit.&nbsp; <i>Margaret Blest</i> gave &pound;50, the
interest to be distributed among fifty poor housekeepers.&nbsp;
Various other legacies, 36 in number, amounting in the whole,
with the above gifts, to &pound;577. 13s. 4d., have been laid out
at different periods in the purchase of land, situate at
Hinstock, Ightfield, Drayton, and Cheswardine.&nbsp; The income
derived from these rents, with the interest on the money laid out
on the school, amounting altogether to &pound;114. 11s., is
carried to one account, with the produce of other charities,
entitled the &ldquo;Poors&rsquo; Account;&rdquo; and after
defraying some few incidental expenses, there is paid thereout
the following sums:&mdash;&pound;7 in sums of 6d. each on St.
Stephen&rsquo;s day; &pound;2. 10s. in small sums on St.
Margaret&rsquo;s day; bread to the amount of 5s. for the poor of
Tyrley; bread to the amount of 19s. to the poor of Drayton on
Easter Sunday; &pound;4 to a schoolmistress; 2s. worth of bread
is given away every Sunday, amounting to &pound;5. 4s. per annum;
and 5s. worth is given in addition on one Sunday in every month,
amounting to &pound;3; making a total of &pound;22. 18s.&nbsp;
The residue of these funds is applied principally in purchasing
blankets and clothing, which are given to poor persons of the
parish who have met with accidents or occasional distress, in
sums of money, varying from 6d. to 5s.&nbsp; We cannot but
observe that the small sums given away on St. Stephen&rsquo;s and
St. Margaret&rsquo;s days, as applications are made to the
churchwardens, appear to be too small to be of any real benefit
to the parties receiving them.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Robert Adams</i>, in 1719, devised certain lands
at Winnington upon trust to pay &pound;13. 12s. yearly (the then
value thereof) as follows:&mdash;&pound;8 to the rector, vicar,
and churchwardens of Muccleston, Drayton, and Adderley,
alternately, on the 25th of March, every year, for putting forth
a poor boy or girl apprentice; 30s. for the education of poor
children in Adderley, and a like sum for educational purposes at
Muccleston; and the sum of 52s. residue thereof to be expended in
bread for the poor of Adderley.&nbsp; The estate is now let for
&pound;35. 12s. per annum, and the rents are applied to the
charitable uses above mentioned.</p>
<p><i>Clara Church</i>, by will 1753, bequeathed &pound;150, and
directed the officiating minister to distribute 2s. weekly,
except in the months of June, July, and August, among poor people
frequenting the church on prayer days, and who should come into
the church at the beginning, and behave with decency during the
time of divine service; to pay 16s. to the minister for visiting
poor sick people in the parish, and distribute the residue of the
interest among poor members of society visited with
sickness.&nbsp; It appears that the amount of Mrs. Church&rsquo;s
legacy was not invested in the funds until December, 1823, when
&pound;174 was laid out in the purchase of certain stock in the
four per cent. annuities.&nbsp; In 1825 part of the stock, and of
another sum of &pound;21. 4s., purchased with a legacy of
&pound;20 left by J. Grosvenor, for an addition to the
organist&rsquo;s salary, appear to have been improperly sold out,
so as to leave &pound;150 stock for this charity, and &pound;20
stock for the organist.&nbsp; The dividends of the &pound;150
stock amount to &pound;5. 5s. per annum; and during forty weeks
in the year 2s. are regularly distributed to the poor, and the
sum of 16s. per annum is paid to the vicar.&nbsp; The residue of
the dividends is appropriated with the proceeds of the church
rate.</p>
<p><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span><i>Joseph Williams</i>, by will 1796, bequeathed to the
minister and churchwardens of Drayton &pound;250, invested in the
four per cent. consols, to pay out of the yearly dividends the
sum of 20s. to the minister of the parish, for preaching a sermon
on Midsummer day; 5s. each to twenty poor widows or widowers, and
twelve pennyworth of bread, on Midsummer day; to the ringers, to
ring from six to eight o&rsquo;clock on the same day, 15s.; to an
eligible person for receiving the dividends and paying the same
to the parish officers, 10s.; to the clerk of the parish, for
keeping an inscription of his donations clean, 5s.; and 30s. to
the overseers, for distributing his donations.&nbsp; He also gave
a further sum of &pound;20 to have an inscription placed in
Drayton church, containing the above donations.&nbsp; The
dividends, amounting to &pound;8. 15s. per annum, are received by
the churchwardens, and applied in the proportions directed by the
testator.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Lawrence</i> left &pound;500 in the five per cents, to
purchase coals to be distributed to the poor inhabitants of the
parish during the winter season; and she left a further sum of
&pound;100, the interest thereof for the Sunday school of the
established church.&nbsp; In respect of the first legacy, there
is &pound;525 new four per cents, the dividends of which,
amounting to &pound;20 per annum, are received by the
churchwardens, and laid out in coals, which are sold to the poor
at about 3d. per cwt. under the cost price; and the produce of
the sale is laid out in like manner, till the fund is
exhausted.&nbsp; The interest of the sum of &pound;100 is applied
for the benefit of the Sunday school.</p>
<p><i>Sophia Grosvenor</i>, in 1816 bequeathed &pound;100, and
directed the amount to be invested in government security, and
the dividends distributed among the poor of Drayton.&nbsp;
<i>Lucina Riddlesden</i> bequeathed &pound;100, and directed the
yearly proceeds to be applied in the purchase of warm stockings
and shoes, to be given among poor boys and girls who should
attend the National School.&nbsp; These two gifts, after
deducting the legacy duty, were invested in the purchase of
&pound;200 three and a half per cent. stock, which now stands in
the names of certain trustees, and of the dividends, amounting to
&pound;7 per annum, &pound;3. 10s. is divided among twenty-eight
poor old persons, men and women, belonging to the parish; the
remaining &pound;3. 10s. is laid out according to the
donor&rsquo;s intentions, in worm stockings and shoes.</p>
<p><i>Charles-Grooby</i>, by his will bearing date 6th October,
1810, gave to Sir Corbet Corbet, the Rev. William Judgson, and
the vicar and churchwardens of Drayton, &pound;1,200 three per
cent. bank annuities, upon trust that they should lay out the
dividends on the 7th of May, yearly, being the birth day of the
testator, towards clothing six poor men and six poor women of the
parish of Drayton.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;1,200 stock now stands
in the names of certain trustees, and the dividends, amounting to
&pound;36 per annum, are received by the churchwardens, and they
provide clothing to that amount, which they divide among six poor
men and twelve poor women of the parish of Drayton.</p>

<h4>HODNET</h4>
<p>is a pleasantly situated and considerable village on the
turnpike road from Shrewsbury to Market Drayton, thirteen miles
N.N. by E. from the former, and six miles S.S. by W. from the
latter.&nbsp; At the Domesday survey Earl Roger held Odenet,
which gave name to the hundred, which has since undergone the
denomination of Bradford North.&nbsp; In the 20th of Edward I., a
<i>quo warranto</i> was brought against William de Hodenet, to
show what right he claimed to hold a market, take assize of bread
and beer, and have free warren in the manor of Hodnet; for plea
he produced the charter of King Henry, father of the then king,
which proved his right, and so was dismissed with honour.&nbsp;
The jury at the same assizes found that the serjeantry of William
de Hodenet was to be steward of the castle of Montgomery, and to
defend the outworks of the castle with his family and servants,
and that this serjeantry had been given to his ancestors by Roger
de Montgomery, Earl of Salop.&nbsp; The market at Hodnet has long
been obsolete, but fairs are <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>held on the Monday before the second
Wednesday in March, May 4th, and the Monday before October
24th.&nbsp; These fairs are usually well attended by the farmers
residing in the surrounding district.&nbsp; The parish of Hodnet
contains the townships of Hodnet, Bolas Parva, Hawkstone, Hopton
and Espley, Kenstone, Losford, Marchamley, Peplow, Woollerton and
Weston under Red Castle.&nbsp; There are 11,596<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 6<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, the rateable value of which is
&pound;13,396. 6s.&nbsp; Population in 1801, 1386; 1831, 2097,
and in 1841 there were 408 houses and 2185 inhabitants.&nbsp; The
township of Hodnet at the census of 1841 contained 120 houses and
596 inhabitants, Odo Hodenet came into England with William the
Conqueror, and fixed his seat here; from this family the estates
passed by a female heiress to the Vernons, and Elisabeth Vernon
carried the estates by marriage into the Heber family, from which
family it again passed in like manner by an heiress to the
present proprietor, Algernon Charles Heber Percy, Esq., who
resides at <span class="smcap">Hodnet Hall</span>, a plain
stuccoed mansion, in a low situation, a little south from the
church; it was formerly of considerable extent, and composed of
timber and plaster, and the cloisters were adorned with ancient
armorial bearings, but only a part of the original house is now
standing, and that has been greatly modernized.&nbsp; Near the
hall is a large mound called Castle Hill, supposed to have been
the ancient residence of the Hodenets.&nbsp; The mound is planted
with trees, and was probably the keep of the castle, but not a
vestige of the stone work remains; the whole was surrounded by a
moat, which may still be traced.&nbsp; The high grounds above the
hall, which are studded with thriving plantations, were in former
tithes a densely wooded park of considerable extent, and well
stocked with deer.&nbsp; No deer have been kept there since the
death of Sir Richard Vernon, who caused most of the timber to be
cut down.&nbsp; Viscount Hill is also a considerable land
owner.&nbsp; A. C. H. Percy is lord of the manor and patron of
the living.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a spacious and
elegant structure, consisting of nave and south aisle, equal in
size to the nave, and an octagonal Norman tower at the west end,
in which are six bells.&nbsp; The side aisle is divided from the
nave by seven pointed arches, rising from octagonal and circular
pillars alternately, and the roof is of timber stained in
imitation of oak.&nbsp; The structure has recently undergone a
complete reparation, the entire cost of which, with various
embellishments, was &pound;3,200, of which the munificent sum of
&pound;1,000 was given by Thomas Cholmondely, Esq., late of
Hodnet Hall; Charles Cholmondely, Esq., gave &pound;500; Lord
Hill, &pound;100; the parishioners raised by voluntary
subscriptions &pound;170; and the rest, &pound;1,430, was given
by the present rector.&nbsp; The organ cost &pound;150, and was
the gift of Richard Cholmondely, Esq.; the communion plate cost
&pound;100.&nbsp; The interior has a very chaste and imposing
appearance, and at the east end of the chancel there is a
beautiful stained glass window, commemorative of Mary Heber, who
died in 1846, sister to the late Bishop Heber.&nbsp; At the east
end of the aisle are twelve stalls, six on each side, which are
for the use of the rector and the lord of the manor.&nbsp; The
organ stands at the west end of the nave in a beautiful recessed
arch.&nbsp; At the east end of the south aisle is a stained glass
window, with representations of the four evangelists, beautifully
executed by Evans, of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The font is very ancient,
and of an octagonal shape rudely carved.&nbsp; Several handsome
monuments ornament the church, particularly one of fine statuary
marble, exquisitely executed by Chantrey, in memory of Bishop
Heber, formerly rector of this parish.&nbsp; Opposite it are two
beautifully executed monuments of Grinshill free stone, near to
which is another in the same gothic style to the memory of
Charles Cooper Cholmondely, formerly rector of Hodnet, who died
in 1831.&nbsp; Near the west end of the nave, a handsome marble
tablet remembers Lord Hill and his Lady, the former died in 1814
and the latter in 1842; not far from which Sir Rowland Hill,
Bart., is remembered on an elegant tablet; he died in 1783, and
was buried in this church.&nbsp; On the same side is an
elaborately ornamented tablet to the Vernon family.&nbsp; A lofty
slate coloured marble tablet commemorates the death of several
members of the Hill family; there is also an antique tablet near
the pulpit to the memory of Hugh <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>Pigot, who died in 1697, besides
which there are various other monuments which our limits will not
allow us to notice.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;26 0s. 10d., now returned at
&pound;2,336.&nbsp; The Rev. Samuel H. Macauley, B.D., is the
incumbent, and resides at the rectory, an elegant mansion of free
stone, built by the late Bishop Heber, in 1812; the house stands
on an eminence a little S.W. from the church, and commands most
delightful views of the surrounding country.&nbsp; The old
rectory stood on the grounds adjoining the hall, a little south
from the church; not far from the rectory stood the tithe barn of
capacious dimensions, which, with the old parsonage, was taken
down soon after the erection of the present rectory.&nbsp; The
tithes of this parish have been commuted for &pound;1,735.&nbsp;
There is a national school where fifty girls and sixty boys are
educated.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Hodnet Common</span>,
situated on the south and south-east side of the township,
contains 375 acres, the whole of which is the property of A. C.
H. Percy, Esq., except about thirty acres.&nbsp; A considerable
tract of the common was enclosed in 1850.&nbsp; There is a small
lock-up with two cells situated on the Shrewsbury road.</p>
<p>The late Reginald Heber, the eminent Bishop of Calcutta, was
rector of Hodnet when he was raised to the episcopal dignity of
Bishop of Calcutta.&nbsp; He was born April 21st, 1783, at the
Higher Rectory, in Malpas, of which place his father was
rector.&nbsp; He received his education, principally under a
private tutor, Mr. Bristow, at Neasdon, and in 1800 he removed to
Oxford, where he was a commoner at Brazennose College, and
afterwards a Fellow of All Souls.&nbsp; It was at Oxford that he
laid the foundation of his high fame.&nbsp; Besides being known
for his general acquisitions in scholarship, he gained every
distinction which the university then had to bestow, the regular
under graduates and bachelors&rsquo; prizes.&nbsp; He was also
the successful competitor for an extraordinary prize that had
been offered for an English poem on the subject of
Palestine.&nbsp; This poem is now of standard reputation; and
certainly, for splendour of imagery and for poetical diction, it
has deservedly placed its author&mdash;scarce twenty years old
when it was written&mdash;in an elevated rank amid our English
poets.&nbsp; After taking his degree, Heber left the university
to engage in active life.&nbsp; The living at Hodnet was at his
option, and this circumstance, coupled with his strong religious
bias, determined him to devote himself to the church as his
profession.&nbsp; But as he was still young for holy orders, he
wished to employ two or three years in foreign travel; and the
customary route upon the continent then being shut up by war, he
bent his steps towards Russia and the east of Europe.&nbsp; At
length the time arrived when Heber was to devote himself
seriously to the duties of his sacred profession, in the humble
office of a village pastor.&nbsp; There is on his monument in
Hodnet church, a delightful testimony how for fifteen years he
performed his pastoral duties &ldquo;cheerfully and diligently,
with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his
strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in this calm retreat, which the
subsequent changes in his fortune seemed only the more to endear
him to, he would cheerfully have closed his days.&nbsp; But his
reputation would not allow him to be buried in retirement.&nbsp;
In 1823 he was elected preacher at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp;
This was an appointment peculiarly suited to him.&nbsp; With what
credit he acquitted himself is well known, and it was generally
believed that the highest honours awaited him at home, when he
was called to another sphere of action, by his acceptance of the
proffered bishopric of Calcutta.&nbsp; Never, it is believed, did
any man accept an office from a higher sense of duty; once he
declined the proposal; but his exalted piety considered it as a
call from heaven, from which he might not shrink; and he
resolutely determined to obey the summons.&nbsp; His career in
India was short, but brilliant.&nbsp; It is not easy to conceive
a situation of greater difficulty than awaited him there.&nbsp;
He had to preside over a diocese much larger in extent than the
whole of Europe, with his clergy scattered about at stations
thousands of miles apart, and over a body of Christians living in
the midst of a multitude of misbelievers; and those Christians,
if such more than in mere name, accustomed to be a law to
themselves in religious matters; yet to all these difficulties
Bishop Heber resolutely addressed himself.&nbsp; He went forth
strong and invincible; first, in his trust in God, and next in
that kindliness <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>of disposition, which almost disarmed opposition.&nbsp;
His memorable exploit was his extra-ordinary visitation of his
diocese.&nbsp; Starting from Calcutta, he pursued the course of
the Ganges almost to its source; visited Himalaya mountains;
crossed the northern provinces of India; and, after visiting
Bombay and the island of Ceylon, returned again to
Calcutta.&nbsp; We may easily imagine what must have been the
delight, to a mind ardent and poetical like Heber&rsquo;s, to
have had the opportunity of visiting scenes so interesting and so
novel; and we have the advantage of knowing the impression they
made on his mind, by the posthumous publication of his
interesting journal.&nbsp; It was not long after the
bishop&rsquo;s return from the visitation of which we have been
speaking, that he undertook another episcopal visitation, when
the hand of death arrested him in his career of usefulness.&nbsp;
On the 3rd of April, 1826, at Tritchinopoli, he was found drowned
in a bath, owing, it was supposed, to the sudden transition of
cold water, after great exertion in confirming some native
Christians.&nbsp; A deep and painful sensation was produced by
his unexpected decease, both in India and at home; and in him the
Christian civilization in the east seemed to have lost its most
zealous, most active, and most enlightened friend.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;There was an old
school in the church yard at Hodnet, which was pulled down in
1814, and a new school and schoolhouse were built in the
following year, in a more convenient situation, chiefly at the
expense of Richard Heber, Esq., and with a sum of &pound;25 given
by Sir Andrew Corbet to the poor, as hereafter mentioned.&nbsp;
The master of the school receives &pound;8, as the interest of
&pound;200 left by Mrs. Sarah Price, for the endowment of a free
school, and he occupies the school house, paying the
church-wardens &pound;1. 1s. annually, as interest of the
&pound;25 derived from Sir A. Corbet&rsquo;s benefaction.&nbsp;
In consideration of the above the master teaches seven scholars
free.&nbsp; The site of the school and schoolhouse, and the
garden and play ground, including altogether about a quarter of
an acre, was given by Mr. Heber.&mdash;<i>Stephen Denstone</i>,
of Ashley, left the poor of the township of Hodnet &pound;100,
the interest to be distributed on Stephen&rsquo;s day
yearly.&mdash;<i>John Stirrop</i>, in 1646, left &pound;20 to the
use of the poor.&nbsp; This gift is stated in the parliamentary
report to be lost.&mdash;<i>Abraham Deshin</i>, in 1707,
bequeathed &pound;5, the interest to be given in bread on
Christmas-day.&mdash;<i>Mary Mollineux</i> left &pound;10, the
interest to be distributed by the ministers and
churchwardens.&mdash;<i>Thomas Burrowes</i> left &pound;100, and
directed the interest to be given away on the 2nd of December
yearly.&mdash;<i>William Burrowes</i> bequeathed &pound;100 to
the poor of Hodnet, the interest to be given to the poor on the
23rd of September, yearly, by the minister and
churchwardens.&mdash;<i>Samuel Dickin</i> left &pound;20, the
yearly proceeds thereof to be distributed by his heirs for
ever.&mdash;<i>Rowland Hill</i> bequeathed &pound;50 to the use
of the poor.&mdash;<i>Thomas Hill</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, son of the
said Rowland Hill, left &pound;350 for the benefit of the
poor.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Ann Catchpool</i> left &pound;50 to the use
of the said poor.&mdash;<i>John Hill</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, left
&pound;100, the interest to be expended in bread and given to the
poor every Sunday.&mdash;<i>The Right Hon. Richard Hill</i>, in
1726, left &pound;100 for the benefit of such poor as the
minister and churchwardens should think fit.&mdash;<i>Richard
Clay</i>, in 1750, left &pound;100 to the poor.&mdash;<i>Mrs.
Brooke</i>, in 1756, left &pound;100, the interest to be given at
the discretion of Sir Rowland Hill and his heirs.&mdash;<i>Sir
Rowland Hill</i>, <i>Bart.</i>, by a codicil to his will, 1779,
left &pound;100 to the poor of this parish, to be distributed at
the discretion of his executor.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Jane Hill</i> left
&pound;100.&mdash;<i>Sir Richard Hill</i>, by his will, dated
January 1st, 1808, left to his brother, John Hill, &pound;300, on
trust, to pay the interest of &pound;100 thereof, at the rate of
five per cent., among the poor of the parish of Hodnet, one half
to be reserved for the poor of the chapelry of
Weston.&mdash;<i>Mr. Grocott</i> left &pound;5 to be given in
bread yearly.&mdash;<i>Stephen Stubbs</i>, in 1815, left
&pound;10, the interest to be distributed yearly on St.
Stephen&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; A legacy of &pound;50 was left by Sir
Rowland Hill for the schooling of poor children.&nbsp; Some lands
called Steel Lands were sold by the parish about the year 1750
for &pound;92.&nbsp; The gifts amount in the whole to
&pound;1355, of which sum &pound;150 were laid out in the
purchase of a messuage and lands at Hodnet in 1701; &pound;56 in
the purchase of two cottages at Hodnet in 1728; &pound;175 were
paid into the hands of Sir John Hill; &pound;431 in the purchase
of an estate at Wem: &pound;450 were <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>held by Sir Rowland Hill, derived
from the charities of Sir Rowland Hill, and other members of that
family, and a further sum of &pound;138 from other sources.&nbsp;
The property at Hodnet consists of certain lands and a cottage
and poor house with a garden and croft adjoining, and a cottage
and croft on Hodnet Heath, with a right of common thereon, the
whole of which produces a yearly income of &pound;35. 12s., which
is distributed with other charities hereafter mentioned.&nbsp;
The property at Wem consists of five closes of land, lying in two
detached parcels near the town, containing altogether about
twelve acres and a half, let at a yearly rent of &pound;40.&nbsp;
The sum of &pound;160 placed in the hands of Sir Richard Hill was
subsequently laid out in the buildings at Hodnet.&nbsp; The rents
derived from the estates above mentioned, and the interest of the
sum of &pound;77, with the produce of Price&rsquo;s and Sir A.
Corbet&rsquo;s charities hereafter mentioned, amounted at the
time the charity commissioners published their report to
&pound;93. 1s. 6d.&nbsp; The rent of the Wem estate is received
by the churchwardens of Marchamley division, and the remainder of
the rents is received by the churchwardens appointed for the
division of Hodnet.&nbsp; Four shillings worth of bread is placed
in the church every Sunday, and given to 32 poor persons, and
bread to the amount of 15s. is also given on St.
Stephen&rsquo;s-day, and 5s. on Christmas-day.&nbsp; Each of the
churchwardens pays equally towards the weekly distribution of
bread, and each of them gives 30s. away on St. Stephen&rsquo;s
day, as the interest of Denstone&rsquo;s legacy.&nbsp; The
churchwardens of Marchamley also pay about 30s. annually towards
schooling poor children at Marchamley.&nbsp; The remainder of the
money is distributed by the churchwardens among the poor of their
respective districts, in sums varying from 3s. to 8s.&nbsp; Of
the money in the hands of Sir Rowland Hill, exclusive of the sum
of &pound;200 mentioned in the school account, and &pound;77 for
which a promissory note was given in 1818, the charity
commissioners conceived that it could not be less than &pound;558
when they published their report, for which the sum of &pound;21
is paid as interest, and distributed by the rector of Hodnet, and
a further sum of &pound;4. 8s. is received by the curate of
Weston chapelry, which is distributed in small sums among the
poor.&mdash;<i>The Rev. Richard Price</i>, in 1730, devised
certain premises to the poor of Drayton and Hodnet, and directed
that &pound;5 per annum should be distributed in bread every
Lord&rsquo;s day, and the residue employed for the schooling of
poor children in each place.&nbsp; The property now held by the
churchwardens of Hodnet in trust for this charity consists of
three pieces of land in Drayton, containing between three and
four acres, which produces a yearly rental of &pound;12. 11s.
6d.&nbsp; The rents are carried to one account with the other
charity money, from which a very small portion only is disposed
of in schooling.&nbsp; It seems advisable that the rents should
be employed according to the particular directions of the
donor.&mdash;<i>Sir Andrew Corbet</i>, in 1815, gave &pound;25 to
the use of the poor of Hodnet.&nbsp; This donation was laid out
in the building of a new school, and the yearly sum of &pound;1.
1s. is paid in respect thereof by the master of the school to the
churchwardens, by whom it is distributed with the other
charities.</p>

<h4>BOLAS PARVA,</h4>
<p>a small township consisting of only two farms, is pleasantly
situated five miles south from Hodnet; at the census of 1841
there were nine houses and 44 inhabitants.&nbsp; The township
comprises 594<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 15<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
which is vested in the devisees of the late Mr. Hatherall.&nbsp;
The tithes have been commuted for &pound;112. 1s. 1d.&nbsp;
William Jennings is the only resident farmer in the township;
Thomas Jones holds the other farm, but resides in the adjoining
township.</p>
<h4>HAWKSTONE</h4>
<p>is a township, in the parish of Hodnet, six miles S.W. from
Market Drayton, eight miles and a half S. from Whitchurch, and
thirteen miles N.N. by W. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; At the census in
1841 here were six houses and 60 inhabitants.&nbsp; The township
contains 693<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 32<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
the tithes of which have been commuted for &pound;115.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Hawkstone Park</span>, the magnificent seat
of Viscount Hill, is delightfully situated in a park of great
extent and picturesque beauty, not far from the turnpike road
leading from Shrewsbury to Whitchurch, and has long been an
alluring object to the admirers of nature, as well as to persons
of taste and curiosity.&nbsp; The mansion is of brick, with stone
finishings, and occupies three sides of a quadrangle, but it does
not appear by whom it was originally built.&nbsp; The principal
front is approached by a flight of steps, leading through a noble
portico (supported by four elegant pillars of the composite
order), considered an admirable piece of architecture.&nbsp; Sir
Rowland Hill, Bart., added the wings, and made other considerable
additions to the hall, which was the family mansion of the Hills
in the time of Edward VI., in which reign we find, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1549, Sir Rowland Hill, Bart., was
Lord Mayor of London.&nbsp; <i>The Entrance Hall</i> is adorned
with ancient and modern armour, much of it collected at Waterloo,
by the late General Lord Hill.&nbsp; <i>The Saloon</i> is a lofty
and spacious apartment, fitted up in a costly manner, and adorned
with some fine paintings; among which is the Siege of Namur, the
five principal characters of which were taken from life.&nbsp;
They are William III., the Elector of Bavaria, the Duke of
Marlborough, Count Cohorn, and the Right Hon. Richard Hill, who
was at that time Paymaster of the Army, Member of the Privy
Council, and Envoy at the Court of Turin.&nbsp; <i>The Drawing
Room</i> is a noble apartment, exquisitely furnished, and
containing several fine paintings, executed by some of the most
celebrated masters.&nbsp; The ceiling and walls are richly
ornamented and gilt, and the furniture is of the same gorgeous
description.&nbsp; <i>The Library</i> contains an extensive and
valuable collection of books, chiefly modern works; several fine
paintings; and in a glass case are the sword and orders of the
late <a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>General Lord Hill.&nbsp; <i>The Billiard Room</i>
contains several valuable pillars brought from Egypt by General
Lord Hill.&nbsp; <i>The Chapel</i> forms the south-west wing of
the hall, and is now undergoing a complete reparation.&nbsp; A
marble pulpit and stained glass windows (the latter illustrative
of scripture history) have been added, which give the interior a
solemn and imposing appearance.&nbsp; <i>The Museum</i> contains
many interesting objects of curiosity, and an extensive and
valuable collection of British birds.&nbsp; Adjoining the library
is the <i>Sculpture Gallery</i>.&nbsp; There are also various
other apartments, adorned in the most tasteful and costly style,
which our limits will not allow us to notice.&nbsp; <i>The
Gardens</i> are laid out with taste, and contain a number of
small ponds for aquatic birds.&nbsp; Near the hall on a gentle
eminence is the <i>Summer House</i>, a handsome octagonal
building of Grinshill freestone; the interior of which is painted
in fresco, and represents the four seasons.&nbsp; From the window
there is a pleasing prospect of a fine sheet of water; and in the
distance appear the Broxton hills and Delamere forest, in
Cheshire.&nbsp; A pleasant walk leads from the summer house to
the <i>Gulph</i>, which separates the grotto rock from the
opposite heights.&nbsp; On emerging from the beautiful lawn, the
most romantic scenery suddenly presents itself to the eye of the
spectator; and proceeding along a rising walk on the side of the
rock, the traveller is conducted to the entrance of <i>The
Grotto</i>, a cleft in the rock, which had lain for ages
undiscovered, till Sir Richard Hill caused all the earth to be
dug away, when it was found that the two sides of the rock so
nearly corresponded with each other that they were doubtless once
united, and separated either by an earthquake or some other
violent convulsion of the earth.&nbsp; After proceeding about a
hundred yards, you arrive at the grotto, which is a vast
subterraneous cave, supported by rude pillars hewn out of the
solid rock; in the midst of which is a spacious recess,
ingeniously inlaid with shells, fossils, and curious
petrefactions.&nbsp; Through a colonnade of rude pillars this
labyrinth is quitted by a door on the west, which opens on an
awful precipice of huge rocks and pending crags, hoary with age,
forming a striking contrast with the verdant lawn and fertile
plain in the distance.&nbsp; Proceeding under the grotto hill, by
a road cut out of the shelving rock, and looking upwards, you
behold enormous crags hanging over you, as if on the very point
of falling.&nbsp; This hill stretches to the south-west to a
considerable distance; and the gigantic rocks heaped one upon
another look more like ruined castles than the turrets of
nature.&nbsp; On leaving the grotto hill, you proceed by the side
of stately oaks and rugged cliffs till you arrive at a natural
cave called <i>The Retreat</i>, the top of which is tinged with
variegated copper.&nbsp; In this cave, with its straw-matted seat
and stone table, is a beautiful stanza, penned by the late Sir
Richard Hill.&nbsp; After quitting the retreat, you pass by
<i>The Canopy</i> and <i>The Indian Rock</i>, surrounded by
scenery of the most romantic character, and mount up a curiously
hewn pathway along the rock till you reach a little cottage, in
which is the figure of a hermit, in a sitting posture, with a
table before him, on which is a skull, an hour glass, a book, and
a pair of spectacles.&nbsp; The next attraction is <i>St.
Francis&rsquo;s Cave</i>, the entrance to which is under a
curiously twisted root of a venerable yew tree.&nbsp; After
groping for some yards in total darkness, you suddenly emerge
into cheering light, and which ever way you turn the most
enchanting prospects are stretched out before you.&nbsp; A
detached piece of rock of a pyramidical form is called <i>The
Fox&rsquo;s Knob</i>, from the circumstance of a fox, some years
ago, leaping from the top to the valley beneath; and being
followed by some of the dogs, the pursuers and the pursued
perished together.&nbsp; Turning to the left, a verdant walk
leads to the summit of <i>The Terrace</i>.&nbsp; This delightful
walk is embosomed in the varied foliage of forest trees, which
reach down to the ground, with openings here and there through
which distant prospects are viewed.&nbsp; Passing beyond the
limits of these Alpine heights, you arrive at <i>Reynard&rsquo;s
Banqueting House</i>, a natural cavern, in which were found the
remains of hares, rabbits, and all sorts of poultry, which the
foxes had carried there to feast upon.</p>
<p>On the highest point of the terrace is erected a noble <span
class="smcap">Obelisk</span>, built of white freestone, and about
one hundred and twelve feet high.&nbsp; From the top of this
column a most <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>unbounded prospect presents itself to view, and England
and Wales vie with each other in the loftiness of their mountains
and the richness of their plains.&nbsp; The gallery of the
obelisk forms an observatory for the astronomer.&nbsp; The
inscription on the base transmits to posterity the piety and
noble acts of a venerable ancestor, a statue of whom in his lord
mayor&rsquo;s gown, copied from an ancient monument which stood
in the church of St. Stephen&rsquo;s, Walbrook, before the fire
of London, is placed on the top, holding the Magna Charta in his
hand.&nbsp; The following is the inscription at the
base:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Psalm</i>, cvi. 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first stone of this pillar was laid by Sir Richard Hill,
Bart. (member in several parliaments for this county), on the 1st
day of October, in the year 1795; who caused it to be erected,
not only for the various uses of an observatory and to feast the
eye by presenting it at one view with a most luxuriant and
extensive prospect, which takes in not less than twelve (or, as
some assert, fifteen) counties, but from motives of justice,
respect, and gratitude, to the memory of a truly great and good
man, viz., Sir Rowland Hill, Knight, who was born at the family
mansion, Hawkstone, in the reign of King Henry VII., and being
bred to trade and free of the city of London, became one of the
most considerable and opulent merchants of his time, and was lord
mayor of the same in the second and third years of the reign of
Edward VI., anno 1549 and 1550, and was the first Protestant that
filled that high office.&nbsp; Having embraced the principles of
the Reformation, he zealously exerted himself in behalf of the
Protestant cause, and having been diligent in the use of all
religious exercises, &ldquo;prayerful, conscientious, and
watchful&rdquo; (as a writer of his character expresses it), yet
trusting only in the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
he exchanged this life for a better, a short while after the
death of that pious young monarch, being aged nearly
seventy-eight years.</p>
<p>For a considerable time previous to his decease he gave up his
mercantile occupations that he might with more devotedness of
heart attend to the great concerns of another world.&nbsp; His
lands, possessions, and church patronage were immense,
particularly in the counties of Salop and Chester, the number of
his tenants (none of whom he ever raised or fined) amounting to
1,181, as appears from his own hand writing.&nbsp; His private
virtues, good deeds and munificent spirit, were quite unlimited
and extended&mdash;like the prospect before us, east, west,
north, and south, far surpassing all bounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Being
sensible,&rdquo; saith Fuller, speaking of him in his
&ldquo;<i>Worthies of England</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;that his great
estate was given him of God,&rdquo; it was his desire to devote
it to His glory.&nbsp; He built a spacious church in his own
parish Hodnet, and likewise the neighbouring church at Stoke at
his own expense.&nbsp; He built Tern and Atcham bridges in this
county, both of hewn stone, and containing several arches
each.&nbsp; He also built other large bridges of timber.&nbsp; He
built and endowed several large schools, particularly that of
Drayton.&nbsp; He made and paved divers highways for the public
utility.&nbsp; He founded exhibitions and educated many students
at both universities, and supported at the inns and courts others
who were brought up to the law.&nbsp; He was the unwearied friend
of the widow and fatherless.&nbsp; He clothed annually three
hundred poor people in his neighbourhood, both with shirts and
coats; and in the city of London he gave &pound;500 (an immense
sum in those days) to St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital, besides
(saith Fuller) &pound;600 to Christ&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp; He
also gave most liberally to all other hospitals, and at his death
bequeathed &pound;150 to the poor of all the wards in
London.&nbsp; He had no children, but his relations and kinsfolk
were numerous, who all partook largely of his bounty, both in his
lifetime and at his death.&nbsp; He constantly kept up a great
family household, where he maintained good hospitality.&nbsp;
Many resorted to him for his wise and salutary advice, and none
who came to him were sent empty or dissatisfied away.&nbsp; Go
thou and do likewise, as far as thy ability will permit, without
injury to thy own relations.&nbsp; It is worthy of remark that as
Sir Rowland Hill was the first protestant lord mayor, anno 1549,
so his father, Thomas Hill, Esq., of Hawkstone, was the last lord
mayor of the Roman Catholic persuasion.</p>
<p><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>A
walk from the terrace leads to the <span class="smcap">White
Tower</span>, a Gothic structure, situated on a bold projection
on the south-west side of the terrace, which is a conspicuous
object for several miles round.&nbsp; In the glen not far from
the White Tower is a cave in the rock, made accessible by means
of some steps through a narrow romantic walk, and which is
remarkable for having been the hiding place of an ancestor of the
Hill family, who met with great hardships from the parliamentary
forces during the commonwealth.&nbsp; In memory of this gentleman
the late Sir Richard Hill caused a handsome urn to be placed near
the cave above mentioned, with the following inscription on the
base of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Anno 1784.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">This urn<br />
was placed here by Sir Richard Hill, Bart.,<br />
(eldest son of Sir Rowland Hill, Bart.)<br />
one of the Knights of this Shire,<br />
as a token of affection to the memory of his much respected
ancestor,<br />
Rowland Hill, of Hawkstone, Esquire;<br />
a gentleman remarkable for his great wisdom, piety, and charity,
who, being<br />
a zealous royalist, hid himself in this glen, in the civil wars
in the<br />
time of King Charles the First.</p>
<p>But being discovered, was imprisoned in the adjacent castle,
commonly called Red Castle, whilst his house was pillaged and
ransacked by the rebels.&nbsp; The castle itself was soon after
demolished.</p>
<p>His son, Rowland Hill, Esq., coming to his assistance, also
suffered much in the same loyal cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The Vineyard</span> is a sequestered glen,
embosomed in foliage and screened by the rocks behind and on each
side, and open only to the south sun, and apparently peculiarly
adapted to the growth and culture of the vine; but although every
effort was tried, the attempt did not succeed.&nbsp; It was laid
out in the manner of a fortification, with turrets, walls, and
bastions, at very great expense, by the late Sir Richard
Hill.&nbsp; From the tower may be seen the town of Shrewsbury,
many of the Cambrian hills, the magnificent Wrekin, and the
towering heights of the Briedden hills, on the latter of which is
the pillar erected in honour of Lord Rodney.&nbsp; About a mile
from the tower is the <span class="smcap">Burgh Walls</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Bury Walls</span>, the remains of a grand
Roman camp, allowed by antiquarians to be the most perfect in the
kingdom.&nbsp; It encompasses about twenty acres of ground, and
is screened on all sides but one by a chain of inaccessible
rocks.&nbsp; The side on which there is no natural defence is
strongly guarded by a triple entrenchment, which must have been a
work of immense labour.&nbsp; Here Roman coins have frequently
been found, and in the year 1821 a spur, pronounced by competent
judges to be of Roman workmanship, was found in the garden of the
Bury farm, about a quarter of a mile from Bury Walls.&nbsp; The
<span class="smcap">Elysian Hill</span> is another object of
attraction; and here you find various rude and whimsical seats to
rest upon, by the side of the mossy bank or rocky cavern, as you
ascend the steep acclivity.&nbsp; An enchanting valley divides
this hill from the <span class="smcap">Red Castle Hill</span>, so
called from the colour of the rock, and of the stone with which
the castle is built.&nbsp; Having ascended the romantic heights,
you enter the castle through a strong door or gateway.&nbsp; This
fortress, long the seat of warriors, and remarkable for its
strength and the prodigious thickness of its walls, is now a heap
of ruins, and inhabited only by birds of prey, whilst its martial
sons are buried in oblivion, and nothing left to perpetuate their
deeds of prowess but these fragments of desolation.&nbsp; Dugdale
informs us that this castle was erected in the reign of Henry
III.; but an ancient manuscript in the Audley family proves it to
have had a much earlier existence.&nbsp; It is there said that
&ldquo;Maud, or Matilda, wife of William the Conqueror, gave to
John de Audley and to his heirs, the lands about Red Castle, in
the county of Salop, for certain services done by <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>him to the
state.&rdquo;&nbsp; The castle and surrounding domain were
purchased by Sir Rowland Hill, Bart., about the middle of the
eighteenth century.&nbsp; On the castle hill there is a deep
well, commonly called the <span class="smcap">Giant&rsquo;s
Well</span>, the depth of which, from the top of the tower, is
two hundred and six feet; it is ten feet in diameter at the
entrance, and hewn out of the solid rock.&nbsp; The tower is also
hewn out of the solid rock to the height of about forty
feet.&nbsp; Near to the well a coffin was found, many years ago,
which, on being exposed to the air, crumbled into dust; in it
were discovered several human bones, and the iron beard of an
arrow.&nbsp; The southern entrance to the glen, which divides the
castle into two nearly equal parts, is flanked on each side by a
rock, on which formerly stood watch towers; and where the fosse,
which intersected the glen, required additional defence or
altitude, masonry was employed.&nbsp; A wall of great strength
has crossed the glen at each end, passing up the slopes of the
hill, connecting the rocks which overlook the entrances, and
enclosing an area of an oblong form.&nbsp; The approach to the
highest division of the castle is by steps cut out of the solid
rock, and continued through a low tortuous passage, the entrance
to which has been guarded by a door.&nbsp; A wall of about three
hundred feet in circumference has been carried round the summit
of the rock, the sides of which are for the most part
perpendicular.&nbsp; The park is richly adorned with timber, and
the scenery is pleasingly diversified and enchanting&mdash;the
awfulness of its shades, the horrors of its precipices, the
verdure of its hollows, and the loftiness of its rocks, all
combine to give an additional charm to the fairy scene.&nbsp; A
fine sheet of water, in some parts nearly one hundred yards in
breadth, stretches for upwards of two miles in length, and forms
the boundary to the north and west sides of the park.&nbsp; The
park is stocked with herds of Scotch bullocks, and upwards of six
hundred head of deer.</p>

class="smcap">Moreton Corbet Castle</span> stands a short
distance from the church, and presents a noble pile of ruins,
magnificent in decay.&nbsp; A considerable portion of the walls
is still standing, but its roof has been many years
demolished.&nbsp; In early times it was the stately mansion of
the Corbets.&nbsp; Several dates may be discovered in different
parts of the building, but the date of its erection is uncertain;
it is probable that only a portion of the original design was
ever completed; and it has by no means the appearance of having
been intended for a fortress, for the windows are large, and
unlike those of castles in general.&nbsp; It was garrisoned in
1644 by the parliament against Charles I.&nbsp; The king having
possession of Shrewsbury and several places in the neighbourhood,
the parliament sent part of the garrison from hence against
Shrewsbury, which soon after surrendered to their forces.&nbsp;
This castle is said to have been partly burnt during the civil
wars, since which it has gradually sunk into insignificance and
dilapidation.&nbsp; The present noble owner is descended from an
ancient and honourable family, who have been seated in this
county from the time of the conquest, when Roger Corbet held
large possessions under the Earl of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Sir Vincent
Corbet was created a baronet in 1641, whose descendant, Sir
Andrew Vincent Corbet, Bart., now resides at Acton Reynald.&nbsp;
Mr. Blakeway gives the following tradition of the Pilgrim of
Moreton:&mdash;&ldquo;The real progenitor of all the Shropshire
Corbets had but one son that we know of, William, who left
issue.&nbsp; Ebraid and Simon occur as granting lands in Wentnor
to the Abbey of Shrewsbury, but we know nothing of them.&nbsp;
William Corbet is stated to have made Wattlesborough his
residence, and no doubt dwelt in that ancient castle, of which,
however, there are no remains so old as his age.&nbsp; He had
three sons, Thomas Corbet of Wattlesborough, Robert of Caus, and
Philip.&nbsp; Several circumstances concur to show that the
former was the eldest, though Robert became much the more
considerable personage.&nbsp; A tradition still subsists that the
heir of Moreton Corbet went to the Holy Land, and was kept in
captivity so long that he was supposed to be dead.&nbsp; In
consequence of this his younger brother engaged to marry, that he
might continue the line.&nbsp; On the morning of his marriage,
says the tradition, a pilgrim came to the house to partake of the
hospitalities of that festal occasion.&nbsp; After dinner he
revealed himself to the assembled company as the long-lost elder
brother; but when the bridegroom would have surrendered the
estate, he declined the offer, and desired only a small portion
of the land, which he accordingly received.&nbsp; Such incidents
are related of other families, and were perhaps not unfrequent in
a romantic age; and some were doubtless feigned.&nbsp; I am
inclined to think the present has a basis of truth, for we are
assured that Thomas Corbet of Wattlesborough went beyond sea, and
left his lands in the custody of his brother Robert; and this may
have given rise to the tale I have just related.&nbsp; The
primogeniture of Thomas is established by the armorial bearings
of his posterity,&mdash;the single raven.&nbsp; The descendants
of Robert bore two such&mdash;a proof that they were a younger
line; but they were barons of the realm, an elevation never
attained by the Wattlesborough branch: and Caus, the seat of
their barony, appears to have been carved out of the elder line,
Westbury, where it lies, having been granted by Earl Roger to
their progenitor, Roger, son of Corbet.&nbsp; All these
coincidences, with the tradition above mentioned, afford it some
support.&nbsp; Moreton, indeed, has in this case been made
prematurely the scene of the transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St.
Bartholomew, is a handsome structure of free stone, in the
decorative style of English architecture, with a square
tower.&nbsp; The interior has a very beautiful and chastened
appearance, and the tablets and monuments to the Corbet family
exhibit some very elaborate workmanship.&nbsp; A monument to
Vincent Corbet, the third baronet, who died in 1670, is richly
decorated with festoons of oak leaves, finely executed in
marble.&nbsp; The four corners are held up by ravens, in allusion
to the armorial bearings of this ancient family, and surmounted
by their crest, the elephant and castle.&nbsp; The latter is said
to have been the armorial bearings of the Scottish Oliphants, one
of whom was taken prisoner by a Corbet, in a war between the two
kingdoms.&nbsp; The living<a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>is a rectory, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;5. 3s. 6d.; now returned at

whole amounting to &pound;86. 5s., were formerly placed out at
interest; but in 1821 the amount was laid out in building some
cottages for the poor, upon land rented for this purpose by the
parish officers.&nbsp; The parishioners having found that no
benefit had been derived from the use of these houses, prevailed
on Sir Andrew Corbet to take the land with the cottages thereon,
and to repay them the sum they had expended, which was again put
out at interest for the benefit of the poor.</p>
<p>The principal residents in Moreton Corbet are Eleanor Bennett,
school teacher; Robert Broughall, farmer; John Harris, farmer;
John Harris, jun., farmer; Mrs. Ann Henshaw, the Castle; Richard
Henshaw, the Castle Farm; William Lawley, blacksmith; Rev. Robert
Faulkner Wood, M.A., the Rectory.</p>
<h4>PRESTON BROCKHURST</h4>
<p>is a scattered village and township, partly in the parish of

&pound;645.&nbsp; The middle and the northern verge of the parish
bordering on Cheshire, present a bold undulating surface, and
from the high grounds a most beautiful prospect of the
surrounding country may be seen.&nbsp; Richard Corbet, Esq., and
John Tayleur, Esq., are joint lords of the manor.&nbsp; The
village of Moreton Say is pleasantly situated three miles west
from Market Drayton, and in 1841 had 42 houses and 202
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value of the township, &pound;1,928.
11s.&nbsp; The population are chiefly employed in agricultural
pursuits, and the land in this locality has been greatly improved
by draining and superior cultivation.&nbsp; The principal
landowners are John Whitehall Dod, Esq., M.P.; the Earl of Powis;
and John Tayleur, Esq.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Church</span> is a venerable fabric, with a tower surmounted by a
wooden turret.&nbsp; The structure underwent a complete
reparation in 1788, at a cost of &pound;386. 8s., which was
raised by private subscriptions.&nbsp; The chancel is ornamented
with a beautiful stained glass window, of exquisite
workmanship.&nbsp; The walls of the chancel are decorated with
implements of war, taken by the late Lord Clive in his campaign
through India; there are also six beautifully designed marble
tablets, in memory of the predecessors of Lord Clive, of Styche
Hall; a fine tomb of elaborate workmanship, with three full sized
figures in a recumbent posture, remembers the Grosvenors of
Eaton, and is dated 1619.&nbsp; A beautiful mural monument,
chastely executed, has been erected in commemoration of John
Bostock, Esq., who died in 1623.&nbsp; There is also a tablet of
curious workmanship in memory of Elizabeth Rotton, with others to
the Corser, Redshaw, Woolley, and other families.&nbsp; In the
churchyard is a magnificent altar tomb of marble, to the memory
of Sir John Markham, who died in 1778.&nbsp; The living is a
perpetual curacy, in the patronage of the rector of Hodnet, and
enjoyed by the Rev. Robert Upton, M.A.&nbsp; The tithes have been
commuted, and &pound;555 apportioned to the rector of Hodnet, and

parsonage is an ancient structure a short distance from the
church.&nbsp; There is a school here, which is chiefly supported
by the minister and a few benevolent individuals.</p>
<p>In the parliamentary returns of 1786 several sums of money are
mentioned as having been given to the poor of this parish,
amounting in the whole to &pound;199. 10s., which sum is stated
to have been laid out in the purchase of &pound;250 stock in the
four per cents.&nbsp; There is reason to question the accuracy of
this statement, as we find that most of the charities recorded
(many of which do not exceed &pound;5) are supposed to have been
distributed as soon as received.&nbsp; There was, however, a
close called the Poor&rsquo;s Field, containing about seven
acres, the rent of which was given away to the poor; but whether
this field was purchased with any part of the charities
bequeathed to the parish, or derived from any other source, is
not now known.&nbsp; This field was sold about seventy years ago,
with the consent of the parishioners, by the churchwardens and
overseers, to Archdeacon Clive, the then incumbent of Moreton
Say, who gave for it &pound;250 stock in the four per cents.,
producing &pound;10 a year, being the rent at which the close was
then let.&nbsp; The dividends of this stock now amount to
&pound;8. 15s., with &pound;1. 5s. added from the poors&rsquo;
rate, to make up &pound;10, is expended in bread, and given away
among poor persons attending divine service at the church.</p>

at the free-school in Drayton, and afterwards at Dr.
Stirling&rsquo;s school, Hempsted.&nbsp; He subsequently became a
celebrated commander in the East India Company&rsquo;s service,
and contributed to the prosperity of the company in a most
unexampled manner.&nbsp; He represented the town of Shrewsbury in
parliament from 1760 to 1774, but rarely spoke in the house,
though upon special occasions he displayed great powers of
elocution.&nbsp; By his will he bequeathed &pound;70,000 to the

<h4>NORTON IN HALES,</h4>
<p>a parish and village situated three and a half miles N.E. by
N. from Market Drayton, at the census of 1841 contained 64 houses
and 312 inhabitants.&nbsp; In 1801 there was a population of 269
souls, and in 1831, 311.&nbsp; The parish contains 1,845 acres,
the gross estimated rental of which is &pound;2,732, 16s.
8d.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;2,475 1s. 8d.&nbsp; The tithes
are commuted for &pound;305.&nbsp; P. Sillitoe, Esq., is the
principal land owner, the other chief owners are William Church
Norcop, Esq., Mrs. Heath, and Rev. Hugh Ker Cokburne, the latter
of whom is lord of the manor.&nbsp; At the Domesday survey
Nortone in Odenet hundred was Held by one Helgot.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span> is an ancient structure dedicated
to St. Chad, consisting of nave and chancel, with a handsome
square tower at the west end, embattled and ornamented with
pinnacles; the chancel is of much older date than the rest of the
church.&nbsp; There is a magnificent monument of Derbyshire
alabaster, with full length figures, of Sir Rowland Cotton and
his lady, in a recumbent posture; it is dated 1686; the Cottons
had a seat at Etwall in Derbyshire, and Bellaport in this
county.&nbsp; Over the tomb is an ancient helmet.&nbsp; There is
also a neat tablet in memory of the Cotton family in the
chancel.&nbsp; The church will accommodate about 100 hearers, and
there is a gallery at the west end which holds about fifty
children.&nbsp; The old antique font of rude construction is now
disused and stands under the tower; a small new font has recently
been added and placed in the chancel.&nbsp; The pews belonging to
the rector and the lord of the manor are handsomely carved.&nbsp;
The curfew bell tolls at eight o&rsquo;clock from Michaelmas-day
to Lady-day, a practice still continued in many of the <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>rural
villages of this county.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in
the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;5. 9s. 4d., now returned at
&pound;330, in the patronage of W. Silver, Esq., and incumbency
of the Rev. Frederick Silver, M.A., who resides at the <span
class="smcap">Rectory</span>, a good stuccoed house pleasantly
situated near the north-east side of the churchyard.&nbsp; There
are eleven acres of glebe land.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Primitive Methodists</span> have a small chapel in the
village.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Bellaport House</span>, the
occasional residence of the lord of the manor, the Rev. Hugh Ker
Cokburne, is delightfully situated on high grounds, and commands
views of great extent and beauty.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Brand
Hall</span>, a good brick mansion, the property of P. Sillitoe,
Esq., was unoccupied when our agent visited Norton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;The National
School is a small structure, where about fifty children are
educated.&nbsp; In 1751 Margaret Higginson left &pound;50 towards
founding a school at Norton; Sir Rowland Cotton gave a house of
two bays and a barn for the use of the schoolmaster, and Ralph
Pilsbury left &pound;6 towards teaching one child.&nbsp; It is
supposed that the money given by Mrs. Higginson was laid out in
the purchase of land, though no deeds can be found relating
thereto.&nbsp; The property belonging the school consists of the
school, with a yard and garden, containing 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 9<span class="smcap">p</span>., and an
allotment of 21<span class="smcap">p</span>. added at the
inclosure.&nbsp; The schoolhouse with a garden containing 19<span
class="smcap">p</span>., and two closes containing 5<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 20<span
class="smcap">p</span>., producing together a yearly rental of
&pound;12.&nbsp; There is also a yearly sum of 4s. 9d. paid by
the churchwardens as the interest of &pound;6 left by Ralph
Pilsbury, the principal having been applied to the use of the
church previously to the year 1746, from which period this
payment has been made.&nbsp; In respect of this income the master
instructs seven children.</p>
<p><i>William Shore</i>, in 1675, gave a rent charge of 26s. 8d.
per annum, issuing out of a meadow in Dorrington, for the use of
the poor, and afterwards in consideration of a sum of &pound;40
conveyed the said land in trust, that all the rents and profits
should be disposed of for the benefit of the poor.&nbsp; The said
&pound;40 having been given by various donors for the good of the
poor of this parish.</p>
<p>Several sums of money given by the Cotton family about the
year 1694, amounting in the whole to &pound;80, were laid out in
the purchase of land and premises at Wem; the property consists
of a house and about six acres of land, which are let for about
&pound;15. 12s. per annum.&nbsp; The income derived from the
above estates forms one fund, which is distributed among poor
parishioners on Good Friday and Christmas-day.</p>
<p><i>Richard Grosvenor</i> left 20s. per annum to the
poor.&nbsp; In the churchwarden&rsquo;s accounts about the year
1756, there is an entry of &pound;30 paid by Robert Davison for
the purpose of exonerating the estate which then belonged to him
from the rent charge, and the amount is carried to the general
account of the church rate.&nbsp; No payment has been made in
respect of this charity from the church rate, but we conceive
that interest on the purchase money ought to be paid from this
account, for the benefit of the poor.</p>

301</span>PREES</h4>
<p>is an extensive parish and considerable village, situated on a
gentle acclivity, four miles north-east from Wem, and fourteen
miles north-east from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The parish contains the
townships of Calverhall or Corra, Darliston, Fauls, Mickley,
Millen Heath, Prees, Sandford, Steele, Willaston, and the
chapelry of Whixall, which together contain 14,160 acres of land,
of which 2,657<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 10<span class="smcap">p</span>. are in
mosses, woods, covers, and heath land.&nbsp; In 1801 the parish
had a population of 2,653 souls; 1831, 3,355; and in 1841 there
were 638 inhabited houses 24 uninhabited, and 3,270
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;17,466. 2s. 8d.&nbsp;
The rectoral tithes are commuted for &pound;1,041. 1s., and the
vicarial tithes for &pound;636.&nbsp; Some part of the land is
mossy, others of a peaty nature, and in some instances gravelly;
there is also a portion of clay soils, of a reddish colour.&nbsp;
The township of Prees contains 3,854<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 11<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land, and is intersected by the Ellesmere, Whitchurch, Newport,
Shrewsbury, and Market Drayton turnpike roads.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;5,474, 8s. 8d.&nbsp; In 1841 here were 302 houses
and 1,473 inhabitants.&nbsp; The land has a bold undulating
surface, and commands interesting views of the surrounding
country.&nbsp; Prees is celebrated as the birth place of the
Salopian hero General Lord Hill, and has acquired importance from
its contiguity to Hawkston, the magnificent seat of Viscount
Hill.&nbsp; In the 43rd of Henry III. the Bishop of Coventry and
Lichfield had a grant of a market here on a Tuesday, and of a
fair on the eve, the day, and the morrow of St. Chad the Bishop,
with the liberty of free warren.&nbsp; In the 35th of Edward I.
the market was changed to Wednesday, but the markets were never
of much consideration, and subsequently were discontinued.&nbsp;
Two fairs are, however, still held, on the second Monday in April
and the second Monday in October, for the sale of sheep and
cattle, which are well attended by the farmers and graziers of
the surrounding country.&nbsp; Viscount Hill is lord of the
manor, and the principal landowner.&nbsp; Sir R. C. Hill, Bart.;
George Harper, Esq.; John Dickin, Esq.; and a few others are also
proprietors.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">General Lord Hill</span>, whose brilliant
military services have acquired such general renown, was born at
Prees, August 11, 1772.&nbsp; His lordship entered the army in
the sixteenth year of his age, and commenced his military duty at
Edinburgh.&nbsp; His friends being anxious for his early
promotion, obtained permission for him to raise an independent
company, which gave him the rank of captain in the army, in the
year 1792.&nbsp; In the interval of his being attached to any
particular corps, he accompanied Frances Drake, Esq., on a
diplomatic mission to Genoa, from whence Captain Hill proceeded
to Toulon, and was employed as aide-de-camp to Lord Mulgrave,
General O&rsquo;Hara, and Sir David Dundas, successive generals
there.&nbsp; He was deputed by Sir David Dundas to be the bearer
of the despatches to England relating to the evacuation of Toulon
by the British.&nbsp; He was shortly after promoted to a
lieutenant-colonelcy in the 90th regiment, and went through a
great deal of arduous duty at Gibraltar, and had his full share
in the memorable Egyptian campaign.&nbsp; In the action of the
13th of March Colonel Hill commanded the advanced guard, and
received a wound in the right temple from a musket ball, the
force of which was providentially averted by a strong brass
binding in front of his helmet; the blow, however, was severe,
and he was removed from the field of battle in a state of
insensibility.&nbsp; After the return of the troops from Egypt,
the 90th was ordered to proceed to Ireland, where Lord Hill
continued to perform his regimental duty till he was appointed
brigadier-general.&nbsp; Early in the summer of 1808 he joined
the army in England, destined to act in the Peninsula.&nbsp; In
the battles of Roleia and Vimiera he was fully employed, and
gained the thanks and approbation of his comrades; and during the
whole of Sir John Moore&rsquo;s advance and retreat Lord Hill
continued indefatigible in his exertions.&nbsp; His humanity and
attention to the troops on their landing at Plymouth earned him
the admiration of the inhabitants, and he was voted the freedom
of the borough.&nbsp; About this time he became possessed of the
seat and estate of Hardwick Grange, left him by his uncle, Sir
Richard Hill, Bart.&nbsp; At the battle of Talavera Lord Hill was
slightly wounded on the head, but his firmness and courage in
repelling the successive attacks of the French, greatly <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>contributed
to the success of the day.&nbsp; The generalship and activity of
Lord Hill in surprising and capturing a French corps under
General Girard, in Spanish Estremadura, is deserving of
commemoration.&nbsp; The force that Girard had with him consisted
of 2,500 infantry and 600 cavalry, the whole of which were
totally dispersed or captured.&nbsp; Among the latter were
General Brune, the Prince d&rsquo;Aremberg, several colonels,
thirty captains and subalterns, and upwards of 1,000 soldiers,
with the whole of their baggage, artillery, and
commissariat.&nbsp; The enemy&rsquo;s loss in killed was very
severe, whilst from the activity and skilful man&oelig;uvres of
Lord Hill, it was very trifling on the side of the British.&nbsp;
Lieutenant-general Hill, during his detached command in Spain,
was principally opposed to Soult, perhaps the most able general
whom Napoleon employed in that country; and the acuteness of
General Hill in foreseeing the intentions of that officer very
materially contributed to the happy results of the action at
Buzaco.&nbsp; In the memorable battle of Vittoria the centre of
the allied army was commanded by the Duke of Wellington, and the
right by Lord Hill.&nbsp; Here the enemy were completely routed,
and the booty which was captured was immense.&nbsp; Besides the
baggage horses, and other articles taken on the field, the value
of the specie, plate, and jewels, was estimated at six millions
of dollars.&nbsp; Of this sum only 100,000 dollars came to the
military chest; the rest was divided by the troops on the
spot.&nbsp; When Lord Hill occupied the valley of Bastan with an
army of 3,000 men, he was attacked by a force of 14,000 men; but
notwithstanding the superiority of the numbers, the enemy
acquired but little advantage over these brave troops, during the
seven hours they were engaged.&nbsp; At the conclusion of another
brilliant achievement shortly after, the noble Wellington rode up
to Lord Hill, and in the spirit of a great and candid mind said,
&ldquo;Hill, this is all your own.&rdquo;&nbsp; The various other
engagements in which Lord Hill took a prominent position, our
limits will not allow us to notice.&nbsp; On his return to his
native country, every token of honour was manifested by his
grateful countrymen, and on his first visit to Shrewsbury
thousands went out to meet him, and his lordship was presented
with the freedom of the borough in a gold box.&nbsp; But the most
splendid and durable token of gratitude and esteem is the column
erected in Shrewsbury to his honour, which is the largest Doric
column in the world.&nbsp; On the unexpected return of Napoleon
from Elba, the allied sovereigns immediately flew to arms, on
which occasion Lord Hill again obeyed the voice of his sovereign,
and in the memorable battle of Waterloo, on the 18th June, 1815,
his lordship gave fresh proofs of his skill, bravery, and
intrepidity.&nbsp; In this conflict Lord Hill&rsquo;s favourite
charger was shot under him; and whilst he was on foot, completely
exposed to the enemy, he was discovered by an officer of Lord
Wellington&rsquo;s staff, who procured him the horse of a French
dragoon.&nbsp; For a full hour the officers of his
lordship&rsquo;s staff were in a state of the greatest
consternation, and twice met under the apprehension that their
beloved general had fallen.&nbsp; On the Duke of Wellington
accepting office as prime minister, in 1828, Lord Hill was
appointed commander-in-chief.&nbsp; The following are the titles
and dignities which he bore:&mdash;Knight of the Grand Cross of
the Order of the Bath, Knight of the Portuguese Order of the
Tower and Sword, Knight of the Grand Cross of the Guelphic Order,
Knight of the Order of Maria Theresa, Knight of the Russian Order
of St. George, Knight of the Belgian Order of Wilhelm, Baron Hill
of Almarez, Hawkstone, and Hardwick Grange.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, a venerable fabric of
red sandstone in the Norman style of architecture, consists of
nave, chancel, and side aisles, and a square tower, in which are
six musical bells.&nbsp; The body of the church is of much older
date than the tower, which is of modern construction.&nbsp; The
church is entered by a fine old porch; the interior has a solemn
and imposing appearance; and the chancel contains several
beautifully designed monuments of exquisite workmanship: that to
the memory of Sir John Hill, with figures in <i>basso
relievo</i>, is a most admirable specimen of modern
sculpture.&nbsp; Major-general Clement Hill is remembered on a
neat tablet erected by his friends and comrades in the Madras
presidency, and by the officers of the Royal Horse Guards, in
testimony of their love for his <a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>person and esteem for his
character.&nbsp; He was born at Prees, on December 6th, 1781, and
died at the Falls of Guersoppa, and was buried at Hanowar, 22nd
January, 1845.&nbsp; There are various other memorials, and over
the charity box is a curiously-carved figure of the
Saviour.&nbsp; The churchyard is elevated, and commands a fine
view of Hawkstone hills and the distant country.&nbsp; There are
several fine old yew trees of considerable girth.&nbsp; The
living is a vicarage, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at
&pound;10; now returned at &pound;507; in the patronage of the
Bishop of Lichfield, and incumbency of the Venerable Archdeacon
John Allen, M.A.&nbsp; The rectoral tithes of this township are
commuted for &pound;329. 15s. 9d., and the vicarial for
&pound;83. 2s. 7d.&nbsp; The vicarage, a good residence, has been
rebuilt on the site of a former edifice, by the present
incumbent; the gardens and pleasure grounds are tastefully laid
out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independents</span> have a small
chapel in Prees, with a burial ground attached; the Rev. Samuel
Minshall is the minister.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Primitive
Methodists</span> also have a small chapel here.&nbsp; There is a
<span class="smcap">National School</span> and an <span
class="smcap">Infant School</span>, which are numerously
attended.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Prees Hall</span>, the
property and residence of Sir Robert Chambre Hill, Bart., J.P.,
is a commodious, pleasantly-situated, and well built mansion of
brick.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>The Right Hon.
Richard Hill</i>, by will, October 17, 1726, bequeathed
&pound;300 for the poor of the parishes of Hodnet, Prees, and
Wem, to be applied for the benefit of such poor as the minister
and churchwardens of each parish should think fit.&nbsp; With
respect to the legacy left to the poor of this parish, it appears
to have been laid out in the purchase of land, which now produces
a yearly sum of &pound;10. 10s.&nbsp; <i>Sir Rowland Hill</i>, in
1769, bequeathed to the poor of the parishes of Hodnet and Prees
the sum of &pound;200.&nbsp; <i>Sir Richard Hill</i>, by will,
1808, bequeathed &pound;30 to his brother, John Hill, in trust,
to pay the interest to the poor of the parish of Hodnet, Prees,
and Wem, in such proportions as his said brother should think
fit.&nbsp; Several sums of money, left by various donors,
amounting in the whole to &pound;140, in the year 1812 was placed
in the hands of Sir John Hill, who gave a promissory note for the
same; and the interest is distributed amongst the poor.&nbsp;
<i>Arthur Harper</i>, by will, 1787, directed his trustees to pay
the interest of &pound;40 to the minister, churchwardens, and
overseers of the parish of Prees, to be distributed among poor
housekeepers of the township of Darliston.&nbsp; The yearly sum
of &pound;5. 4s. is paid as a rent charge issuing out of a field
in Williston, called the White Bread Field.&nbsp; It does not
appear from whose benefaction this arises.&nbsp; The amount is
expended in bread and given among the deserving who attend divine
service.&nbsp; <i>Elizabeth Barbour</i> devised certain lands,
and directed the proceeds to be expended in bread and given
amongst the poorest parishioners every Sunday.&nbsp; The property
thus devised consists of 9<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 35<span class="smcap">p</span>., with a
small cottage, which was built by the vicar on the site of an old
house destroyed by lightning.&nbsp; It is let for &pound;12 a
year, which is applied in carrying out the donor&rsquo;s
intentions.</p>

name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span><span
class="smcap">Boydell</span>, Esq., the liberal and spirited
patron of talented engravers.&nbsp; His father was a farmer, and
his son was intended for a land surveyor; when, however, about
twenty years of age, he was put apprentice to an engraver, in
which art he soon excelled, and from the profits derived from the
sale of a book of 152 prints, engraved by himself, he began to
encourage the best English engravers, and presented the public
with a series of engravings of the works of the best masters,
which soon laid the foundation of an ample fortune.&nbsp; He was
elected an alderman in 1782, sheriff in 1785, lord mayor of
London in 1790, and in the same year master of the
Stationers&rsquo; Company.&nbsp; He was the greatest encourager
of the art that this country ever had, and the English
engravings, which before were considered much inferior to those
of foreign nations, began from that time to be highly prized; and
the exportation of them became a valuable branch of
commerce.&nbsp; He also was a great encourager of the art of
painting, and to this effect he undertook the superb edition of
the Shakspeare gallery, the expense of which was enormous, and
more perhaps than any individual had ever before embarked for
such an object.&nbsp; Mr. Boydell, in a letter to Sir John
Anderson, says, &ldquo;I have laid out, with my brethren, in
promoting the commerce of the fine arts,
&pound;350,000.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the charitable and benevolent
institutions he was a generous benefactor, and an attentive
guardian.&nbsp; He died December 12th, 1804, and his remains were
interred in great funeral state, in the church of St. Olave,
Jewry.</p>

Smith</i> left the interest of &pound;20; <i>Richard Smith</i>,

in 1817, gave 25 guineas.&nbsp; These several sums, amounting to
&pound;98. 7s., together with &pound;1. 13s. advanced from the
poor rates, were placed in the hands of Sir Rowland Hill, who
gave a promissory note for the amount to the churchwardens and
overseers.&nbsp; Of the interest, &pound;2 is laid out in bread,
which is distributed every Sunday, in respect of Colley&rsquo;s
charity, 9s. is laid out on Christmas day, and the same sum on
Good Friday, as the gifts of Richard and Joseph Smith.&nbsp; The
remainder is given away in small sums on St. Andrew&rsquo;s
day.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Harper</i>, in 1828, gave &pound;150, upon trust,
and directed the interest of &pound;50 to be distributed among
poor widows on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day; the interest of &pound;50
among poor men; and the profits of the remaining &pound;50 to be
paid to the master or mistress of the Sunday school at
Stanton.&nbsp; This sum was placed in the hands of Sir John Hill,
and secured by bond, bearing date September 29th, 1813.&nbsp; The
interest is divided into three shares, and distributed according
to the donor&rsquo;s intentions.</p>

population of 3,919 souls, of whom 1,952 were males and 1,967
females, at which period there were 832 inhabited houses, 40
uninhabited, and two houses building.&nbsp; The tithes have been
commuted for &pound;2,100.&nbsp; The town of Wem is pleasantly
situated near the banks of the river Roden, 11 miles north from
Shrewsbury; the streets are irregularly formed, and many of the
houses have an ancient appearance; there are, however, many good
houses and shops, and several respectable private residences of
more modern erection, particularly in those parts of the town
called New-street and Islington.&nbsp; The township contains

antiquity, and was anciently written <i>Wemme</i>.&nbsp; At the
Domesday survey it was held by William Pantulph, or Pantulf, of
Earl Roger, when there were &ldquo;<i>four geldable hides and an
airy of hawks</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this time most of the land
about Wem lay waste, covered with a vast pool, or overgrown with
woods.&nbsp; When William the Conqueror deprived the English of
their estates he gave the greatest part of Shropshire to Roger de
Montgomery, and he shared it out among the principal officers
that commanded under him, on condition that they should pay him
homage, fight for him, not dispose of their daughters in
marriage, nor their goods by will without his leave; that their
heirs whilst minors should be in wardship to him, and pay a
relief for admission to their estates when they came of
age.&nbsp; On these terms Earl Roger granted to William Pantulph
28 towns or manors in the county of Salop, whereof Wem being one
of the chief places Pantulph made it his seat, and the head of
his barony.&nbsp; In the 7th of King John, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1205, Warin Fitzgerald procured the
grant of a market to be held weekly, and a fair yearly at his
manor of Wemme.&nbsp; It has therefore been a market town 646
years.&nbsp; The market was then held on Sunday, as was then
commonly done in other places.&nbsp; This continued till the 24th
of Edward III, when Simon Islip, archdeacon of Canterbury, forbid
the going to market on the Lord&rsquo;s day for the future, and
the market was subsequently held on Thursday, on which day it
still continues to be held, and is numerously attended by the
farmers who reside in the surrounding district.&nbsp; Fairs are
held on the first Thursday in March, May 6th, Holy Thursday, June
29, last Thursday in September, and November 22nd.</p>
<p>The barony of Wem was of considerable extent; on the north it
stretched to Whitchurch, on the east it took in Tilley and
Cresswell, in Staffordshire, on the south it bordered on the
Clive, and on the west on the parish of Ellesmere.&nbsp; The
first baron was William Pantulph, who had great estates in
Normandy, which he held of his superior lord Roger de Montgomery,
a relation of one of the generals of William the Conqueror.&nbsp;
By his tenure he was obliged to attend this Roger in war, and
came over with him in the expedition against England.&nbsp;
Shortly after the battle of Hastings Roger de Montgomery bestowed
28 manors in this county upon the said Pantulph, to be held by
military service.&nbsp; These manors consisted of as many
knight&rsquo;s fees as composed a barony, the head of which
Pantulph fixed at Wem, which he chose for the place of his
residence.&nbsp; The Earl of Shrewsbury, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1102, engaged in a rebellion against
the king, and required William Pantulph, his vassal, to aid him
with such a number of men as he was obliged to furnish by his
tenure.&nbsp; On his refusing he disinherited him of all his
lands and possessions in Shropshire, upon which the king made him
governor of Stafford Castle.&nbsp; The king having resolved to
beseige Shrewsbury, William Pantulph attended the king on this
expedition, and finding the roads bad and narrow and the country
full of woods lined with archers, the king employed 6,000
soldiers in cutting down the woods and opening the roads.&nbsp;
On the royal troops appearing before Shrewsbury the king
threatened to hang all <a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>that he should take therein, and
shortly after the town was surrendered.&nbsp; The Earl of
Shrewsbury by his treason having forfeited his honour and estate
to the crown the barony of Wem was henceforth held immediately by
the king, and hence the lords thereof had a right to sit in the
great councils of the realm.&nbsp; William Pantulph lived to a
great age and died beyond sea.&nbsp; The last of this family who
held the barony was William Pantulph, who died in the 7th of
Henry III., <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1233.&nbsp; About
this period a perambulation was made to settle the boundaries of
the manor of Wem and that of Prees; the latter belonged to the
bishop of Lichfield and Coventry.&nbsp; On the death of the above
William Pantulph, his father-in-law, Fulk Warine, gave the king
6,000 marks for the wardship of his lands and heir, with the
benefit of her marriage.&nbsp; This Fulk was one of the barons
that in 1214 confederated against King John, and who was
subsequently excommunicated by the pope.&nbsp; On the marriage of
Maud, the heiress of William Pantulph, with Ralph de Boteler, he
settled at Wem, and in 1370 the barony was carried by an heiress
of the Botelers into the family of Ferrars, and afterwards in
like manner to the Greystocks, a noble family whose principal
seat was Greystock Castle, in the county of Cumberland.&nbsp;
Ralph Lord Greystock, the second baron of this family, left a
granddaughter, who married Thomas Lord Dacre; this family had
their chief seat at Dacre Castle in Cumberland.&nbsp; The fourth
baron of this name, George Lord Dacre, being a minor at the death
of his father, Thomas Duke of Norfolk obtained the wardship of
him, but had not enjoyed it long before this young lord died, and
his three sisters became co-heiresses.&nbsp; Ann married Phillip
Earl of Arundle, and Elizabeth Lord William Howard, son of the
Duke of Norfolk, but Mary died unmarried.&nbsp; Thomas Duke of
Norfolk, on the death of his third wife, formed the project of
marrying Mary Queen of Scotts.&nbsp; In the 15th of Elizabeth,
however, he was beheaded for what his peers adjudged to be
treason.&nbsp; By his attainder his eldest son Philip, having
lost his titles of honour that were to have descended to him from
his father, assumed the style of Earl of Arundle in right of his
mother, who was daughter to Henry Fitzallan, the last Earl of
Arundle of that family.&nbsp; In the 25th of Elizabeth the court
of Wem was first called in the name of Philip Earl of Arundle,
and of lady Ann, his wife.&nbsp; His zeal for popery, and the
resentment he was supposed to entertain for the hard usage of his
family, rendered him suspected by the government, and he was
eventually condemned to imprisonment during the queen&rsquo;s
pleasure, and fined &pound;10,000.&nbsp; In the 31st of Elizabeth
the court at Wem was first called in the name of the queen, on
account of the attainder of Philip Earl of Arundle, but as he had
held the barony and manor of Wem in right of his wife, by his
attainder he forfeited them only during his own life, so that on
his decease they reverted to the Countess Dowager Ann, on whose
death, Thomas Howard, her only son, succeeded to the dignity of
baron of Wem.&nbsp; On the accession of James I. to the throne,
this Thomas was restored in blood, with the title of Earl of
Arundle and Surrey, and put in possession of the estates
forfeited by his grandfather&rsquo;s attainder, thus he had a
great fortune by descent, and a much larger one with his wife,
who was the heiress of the great house of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In
1611 he was made knight of the garter, and in 1621 he was created
Earl Marshall of England, with a pension of &pound;2,000 per
annum.&nbsp; In the 8th of Charles I. we find the court baron of
Wem called in the name of the Right Honourable Thomas, Earl of
Arundle and Surrey, premier, Earl of England, Lord Howard,
Fitzallans, Maltravers, Mowbray, Segrave, Bruse, and Wem, Earl
Marshall of England, knight of the most noble order of the
garter, and one of the lords of the king&rsquo;s honourable privy
council.&nbsp; He is said to have been a proud man, and his
expenses always exceeded his revenue; he was the greatest
encourager of painting, sculpture, designs, carving, and building
that the age produced, and he employed persons many years in
Italy and Greece to collect rarities for him; his statues and
paintings were equal in number and value to those in the houses
of most princes, and he provided the most sumptuous and
magnificent entertainments.&nbsp; The barony was subsequently
held by the Playters, Onslows, Wycherleys, and Jeffreys.&nbsp; On
the death of John Lord Jeffreys, in <a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>1720, the barony and manor of Wem
descended to his daughter, then a minor, and shortly after the
barony of Wem and the manors of Wem and Loppington, and the land
and tenements thereto, were sold to Henry Lord Newport,
afterwards Earl of Bradford, for &pound;12,000.&nbsp; In 1730,
Lord Newport, by will, devised all his real estate, in trust, for
Mrs. Ann Smith, and his natural son by her, John Harrison.&nbsp;
He took the name of Newport; but losing the use of his reason,
his mother conveyed the estate after his death to William
Pulteney, Earl of Bath, from whom it has descended to the present
proprietor, the Duke of Cleveland.&nbsp; A court leet and baron
is held yearly in October.&nbsp; Jonathan Scarth, Esq., steward;
Thomas Griffiths, bailiff.&nbsp; Formerly at these courts causes
were tried for debts or trespass in actions under 40s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a venerable structure
dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, consisting of nave, chancel,
and side aisles, with a heavy square tower sixty-nine feet high,
in which are six musical bells; on the west side stands the
statue of a man, as large as life, with a truncheon in his hand,
supposed to represent Ralph, lord Greystock, baron of Wem, who
probably was at the charge of building the steeple; on the east
side is the statue of a lady, with the model of the church in her
right hand, and a cross in her left hand.&nbsp; The north porch,
and the lower part of the walls are built of red sand stone,
coarsely worked, and are perhaps the remains of the first church
erected here in Saxon times.&nbsp; The tower and upper part of
the walls, and most of the buttresses are of the Grinshill free
stone.&nbsp; The vestry was built before the great fire which
burnt the roof, then covered with shingles, the gallery, and all
the timber work, damaged the walls and melted the bells.&nbsp;
The west window and the tower were built in 1667, and the west
end of the church, the roof, and the pews, in 1678.&nbsp; The
chancel was built about the year 1680: since that period the
frequent reparations and alterations have left but little of the
ancient character of the church remaining.&nbsp; The bells were
cast in the same year, and a clock and chimes added in
1726.&nbsp; The communion plate are of large size, and consist of
chalice, pattin, flagon, and basin, which were the gift of
Gerrard Shelley, and Cicely his wife in 1707.&nbsp; The
accommodation in the church was increased by building two new
galleries, one on the north and another on the south side, and
altering the pews in the old gallery at the west end in 1840,
when 274 additional sittings were obtained, which are free and
unappropriated, in consequence of a grant from the incorporated
society for building and enlarging churches.&nbsp; There are also
703 appropriated sittings.&nbsp; There are tablets to the Smiths,
Wycherleys, Fields, Traceys, and others.&nbsp; The living is a
rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;26. 4s.
4&frac12;d.; in the patronage of the Duke of Cleveland, and
incumbency of the Rev. John Charles D. Merest, M.A., who resides
at the rectory, a pleasantly situated mansion, built by the late
rector, who exchanged the old rectory, and obtained a grant from
Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty, towards the erection of the present
structure.&nbsp; Dr. Henry Aldrich, an eminent divine and polite
scholar, was rector of Wem.&nbsp; He was born at Westminster, in
1647, and educated under the famous Busby.&nbsp; In 1662 he was
admitted into Christ Church College, Oxford and having passed
through the gradations of bachelor of arts in 1666, and master in
1669, he took orders and became an eminent tutor in his
college.&nbsp; In 1681 he was installed canon of Christ Church,
and in the same year took the degrees of bachelor and doctor of
divinity.&nbsp; During the reign of James II. he published
several tracts on the popish controversy, which are said to have
shown a clearness of arguing and depth of <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>learning
far beyond anything that had at that time appeared in our
language.&nbsp; In order to excite and cherish a taste for polite
literature, he annually published some piece of an ancient Greek
author, as a new year&rsquo;s gift for the students of the
college.&nbsp; He wrote a system of logic, entitled &ldquo;Artis
Logic&aelig; Compendium,&rdquo; Oxon, 1691, 8vo.; and
&ldquo;Elements of Geometry,&rdquo; in Latin, never
published.&nbsp; He was also concerned in Gregory&rsquo;s Greek
Testament, printed at Oxford in 1703, folio; and
Havercamp&rsquo;s edition of Josephus.&nbsp; By his skill in
architecture he improved the buildings of the college; and that
part of it called Peckwater quadrangle, deservedly admired, was
designed by him.&nbsp; His abilities as a musician rank him, in
the opinion of competent judges, among the masters of the
science; and although he chiefly applied himself to the
composition of sacred music, yet he occasionally diverted himself
by producing pieces of a lighter kind.&nbsp; For the
entertainment of smokers, to which fraternity he belonged, he
composed a smoking catch, to be sung by four persons while they
were smoking; and he was also the author of &ldquo;Hark! the
merry Christ church bells.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died at his college in
1710, leaving an order to be buried, without any memorial, in the
cathedral.&nbsp; &ldquo;His modesty and humility, his easy
pleasantry, his attention to academic business, and to the credit
of his college, his exertions for the encouragement of learning,
and the proofs which his memoirs afford of reputable talents,
various accomplishments, and amiable qualities, unite to transmit
his name with honour to posterity.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span>, situated in Chapel
street, is a considerable building of brick, fronted with
freestone.&nbsp; The interior has a neat and chaste appearance,
and is provided with a circular gallery.&nbsp; It was built in
1834, and will accommodate five hundred hearers.&nbsp; The
congregation is under the pastoral care of the Rev. Joseph
Pattison.&nbsp; There is a Sunday school in connection with the
chapel, with about 150 scholars.&nbsp; The Independents have
another chapel in Noble street, where the Rev. John Saddler is
the pastor.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Primitive Methodist

<p><span class="smcap">The Grammar School</span>.&mdash;<i>Sir
Thomas Adams</i>, the founder of the free school at Wem, was born
in the year 1586; he was the son of Thomas Adams, a respectable
tanner at Wem, who had his tan pits where the school now
stands.&nbsp; His son received a liberal education at the
university of Cambridge, and was afterwards brought up a draper
in London.&nbsp; In 1639 he was elected sheriff of London, on
which he gave up business, and devoted his time entirely to the
duties of his office, and the good of the citizens.&nbsp; He was
elected Lord Mayor of London 1645, which office he filled with
the greatest disinterestedness.&nbsp; About this time the enemies
of Charles I., who were then coming into power, thought proper to
search his house, in pursuit of that unfortunate monarch, knowing
his strong attachment to the royal cause; in the year 1647 he was
committed to the tower, where he remained some time.&nbsp; He,
however, continued his attachment to the royal cause, and is said
to have carried his zeal so far as to have remitted ten thousand
pounds to Charles II. while in exile.&nbsp; On the accession of
that monarch to the throne, Sir Thomas was advanced to the
dignity of baronet.&nbsp; Amongst the documents belonging to the
free school there is a copy of the orders and statutes prescribed
by him for the government of the same, purporting to have been
made March 4, 1650.&nbsp; By these orders it is declared Rowland
Hill, Esq., and fourteen others, should be enfeoffed of the lands
and hereditaments appertaining to the school.&nbsp; That the said
school should be for all children within the parish of Wem,
except the children of those parents who being of ability should
not have contributed towards the advancement of the said
school.&nbsp; The statutes also contain regulations for the
internal management of the school, and directions that prayers
should be read every morning and evening, and the scholars
catechised in the principles of the Christian religion.&nbsp; The
gross annual income derived from the school property when the
charity commissioners published their report amounted to
&pound;336. 15s., out of which the head master received a salary
of &pound;160 per annum, the second master &pound;70, and the
third master &pound;70 per annum.&nbsp; The <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>school is
free to all boys of the parish of Wem for instruction in classics
and English grammar; each scholar pays a small entrance fee, and
if they learn writing or accounts they pay for such instruction
from 7s. 6d. to 10s. 6d. per quarter.&nbsp; A portion of the
income of the school arises from lands purchased by the first
Feoffees of the school, who were instrumental in raising upwards
of &pound;370, which sum was laid out in the purchase of land for
the general benefit of the school.&nbsp; The principal object of
the foundation was evidently the instruction of free scholars,
but when the charity commissioners published their report there
were only two on the foundation, and there were only six when our
agent visited Wem.&nbsp; The Rev. William Boulton is the head
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The British School</span>, a neat brick
structure pleasantly situated, was erected in 1839, at the cost
of about &pound;800; it is capable of accommodating 200 boys and
200 girls, and consists of an upper and lower room; the latter is
occupied by the boys, and the entrance is from Dark-lane, and the
former by the girls, who have an entrance from Chapel
street.&nbsp; At the present time 130 boys and 90 girls attend
the school, which is chiefly self-supporting.&nbsp; The Privy
Council on Education gave the sum of &pound;200 towards the
erection of the school.&nbsp; Thomas H. Taylor and Mrs. Taylor

<p>The following account of the state of Wem during the civil war
is chiefly extracted from Garbet&rsquo;s interesting history of
that town.&nbsp; When the war broke out in 1642 the populace were
in general in favour of royalty; the persons of most distinction
in the county who supported the parliament were Mr. Mitton, Mr.
Mackworth, and Thomas Hunt, Esq., M.P. for Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The
above gentlemen, attended by Richard Baxter, a famous dissenting
minister, having got a small body of troops about the latter end
of August, 1643, settled a garrison at Wem, being the first which
the parliament had in this county.&nbsp; To fortify the town a
rampart or wall of earth was thrown up, which began at Drayton
gate, and ran along the side of Sandland&rsquo;s yard, and about
fourscore yards into Cordwell, where it formed an angle, defended
by a wooden tower; then it turned towards the mill, crossing a
meadow and a road just below Oliver&rsquo;s well, and passed
along the side of the parsonage garden, till it came to the
Shrewsbury gate.&nbsp; It then crossed the alleys to the corner
of the school garden, whence it turned through the tan pits on
the east side of the brook to Ellesmere gate.&nbsp; Thence it
extended along the Noble-street garden to two houses, then in the
fields where a guard was kept, and from those houses to the
Whitchurch gate, and thence over Shenton&rsquo;s field it came up
to Drayton gate.&nbsp; The ditch was about four yards wide and of
a proportionate depth, but probably narrower in those places
where the land could be flooded, for the low grounds were laid
under water from Woodhouse&rsquo;s croft to Cordwell.&nbsp; The
earth thrown out of the ditch made the wall or rampart, which was
strengthened by palisades placed so thick that a whole coppice in
Lacon was cut down for this purpose.&nbsp; All the houses and
buildings without the rampart were burnt to prevent their giving
shelter to the enemy.&nbsp; As soon as the king had notice of a
garrison having been placed at Wem, he sent Lord Capel to
Shrewsbury, as lieutenant-general of Shropshire; the parliament
sent Sir William Brereton, a Cheshire gentleman, to oppose
him.&nbsp; Lord Capel, at the head of 5,000 men, made an attack
upon Wem before its works were finished.&nbsp; At the same time
Sir William Brereton, with his Cheshire forces, drew near the
town to support and defend it.&nbsp; By a man&oelig;uvre Lord
Capel induced General Brereton to return to Nantwich, and in the
meantime he attacked Wem, which was but ill provided against an
assault, the gates were without hinges, being only reared up, and
only forty soldiers remained in the town, the rest of the forces
consisted of the rabble of the town, among whom a number of women
particularly distinguished themselves, and gave occasion for the
following rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The women of Wem and a few musketeers,<br
/>
Beat the Lord Capel and all his cavaliers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The principal attack was made at Drayton gate; and old Vicars,
in his &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Ark overtopping the World&rsquo;s
Waters,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;The great slaughter and execution
which were performed upon the enemy when they set upon Wem, there
being six cart loads of dead men carried away at one time,
besides the wounded; and as it is said, there were fifteen found
buried in one grave.&nbsp; Little execution was done upon our
men; we lost not above three in the town&mdash;Major Marcow, one
soldier, and one boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the king&rsquo;s party he
enumerates Colonel Wynn, slain; Major Vaughan, wounded; one of
Winter&rsquo;s captains shot in the back; Captain Davison, taken
prisoner, since dead; Captain Manley, Captain <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>Ellis, and
Colonel Scriven, wounded.&nbsp; As the troops of Brereton
approached, Lord Capel drew off his forces and returned to
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In 1644 the garrison of Wem seems to have been
better provided for their defence.&nbsp; Prince Rupert, on his
march to Chester, seemed determined to attack Wem; but having
taken a view of the place from the Trench farm, he slighted it,
saying, &ldquo;It is a crow&rsquo;s nest that will not afford
each of my men a piece of bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this time the
greater part of Shropshire was for the king; but after the fatal
battle of Naseby he lost ground in almost every part of the
kingdom.&nbsp; Major-general Mytton was governor of Wem, the
garrison whereof took Ercall House, belonging to Lord Newport;
Apley Castle, belonging to Mr. Charlton; Moreton Corbet House,
belonging to Sir Andrew Corbet; and Shrawardine Castle, the seat
of the Bromleys.&nbsp; The plunder brought into Wem during these
unhappy disturbances contributed greatly to induce an appearance
of prosperity.</p>
<p>The dreadful fire which happened March 3rd, 1677, is a
remarkable era in the history of Wem.&nbsp; It was occasioned by
a girl suffering a lighted caudle to ignite the thatch of her
parents&rsquo; dwelling.&nbsp; The season being dry and the wind
boisterous, the devouring flames were speedily carried along the
High street, Cripple street, and the Horse Fair, consuming every
edifice except the free school.&nbsp; In Noble street it extended
as far as the Draw well house, and in Milk street as far as the
Rector&rsquo;s barn.&nbsp; The church, the market house, seven
score houses, and treble the number of outbuildings were
burnt.&nbsp; The wind blew the burning thatch and shingles to a
vast distance, so that in one hour the town was completely
enveloped in flames.&nbsp; The loss of the property consumed was
estimated at &pound;23,677. 3s. 1d.</p>
<p>Among the eminent individuals of which Wem has been the birth
place or residence, may be enumerated the benevolent Sir Thomas
Adams, before mentioned, the founder of the Grammar School.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Wycherley</span>, one of the most eminent
wits and comic poets of his day, was born here in 1640; he
married the Countess of Drogheda, but after her death, from law
suits with her relatives, he became embarrassed in his
circumstances.&nbsp; He married a second wife a few days before
his death, which happened in September, 1815.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">John Astley</span>, Esq.: This artist, from the
peculiarity of his good fortune, rather than by his exertions as
an artist, has obtained a memorial in biographical history.&nbsp;
He was born at Wem, and when of age to assume a profession he was
sent to London, and placed as a pupil under Mr. Hudson; when he
left him he visited Rome, and on his return from thence he went
to Dublin, where he practised as a painter for about three years,
and in that time acquired three thousand pounds by his
pencil.&nbsp; On his coming over to England, and painting his way
back to London, in his own post chaise, with an outrider, he
loitered, with a little pardonable vanity, in his native
neighbourhood, and visiting Knutsford assembly with another
gentleman, Lady Daniel, a widow then present, was at once so won
by his appearance, that she made arrangements to sit for her
portrait, and then made him the offer of her hand; a boon which
he did not think it prudent to refuse.&nbsp; This lady, by
marriage articles, settled the whole of the Duckinfield estate
upon him, after the death of her daughter by Sir William
Daniel.&nbsp; Mr. Astley eventually became possessed of these
estates, and died at his house, Duckinfield Lodge, Cheshire,
November 13th, 1787, and was buried at the church in that
village.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John Ireland</span>, the
author of &ldquo;Illustrations of Hogarth,&rdquo; and other
esteemed works, was also born at Wem.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Francis
Chambre</i>, by his will, dated December 26th, 1676, charged
certain lands with the payment of 40s. per annum, to be disposed
of for the benefit and repairs of the chapel at Newton, or for
the augmentation of the salary of the third school-master at Wem,
or to both, at the discretion of his kinsman, George Chambre of
Loppington, and the Rev. William Chettoe, and their heirs for
ever.&nbsp; The premises charged with this payment are now the
property of Mr. Dickin, who pays &pound;2 to the schoolmaster and
chapel warden every alternate year.</p>
<p>In 1703 <i>Richard Corbet</i>, <i>Esq.</i> granted a yearly
rent charge issuing out of two farms at High Hatton, and directed
that &pound;4 thereof should be laid out every alternate year in
buying <a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>six cloth coats or gowns for six poor people, four to
be chosen from the parish of Wem, and two from Loppington; the
said persons to be housekeepers reduced to poverty by misfortune;
that &pound;4 should be laid out every alternate year in clothing
three poor boys of the parish of Wem, to be set out apprentices
to husbandry; that 20s. per annum be paid to a writing master for
teaching four poor boys writing and arithmetic.&nbsp; And he
further directed, that every alternate year the said rent charge
of &pound;10 should be laid out in binding two boys, of the
parish of Wem, apprentices to handicraft trades.&nbsp; The sum of
&pound;9 to be disposed of in one year, and &pound;11 the next
year, and so on from year to year.&nbsp; The yearly sum of
&pound;10, with some additions thereto, varying according to
circumstances, is paid by Sir Andrew Corbet, the owner of the
estate at Hatton.&nbsp; The objects of the charity are selected
by the trustees, who meet about February every alternate year for
the purpose, and 21s. is paid on that day towards the expenses of
such meeting.</p>
<p><i>William Hinton</i>, and <i>Dorothy</i>, his wife, in
consideration of &pound;101. 1s. 6d., conveyed to certain
trustees and their successors two pieces of land in Whixall,
called the Stanley End Pieces, to the use of the poor of the
parish of Wem.&nbsp; Of the above, &pound;50 was the gift of
<i>Thomas Spendelow</i> during his lifetime, who directed the
proceeds thereof should be laid out in bread every Lord&rsquo;s
day for the poor inhabitants of the parish.&nbsp; There has been
no subsequent conveyance to trustees, and the churchwardens have
from time to time let the property, which consists of two fields,
containing rather more than seven acres, now let at a good rent
of &pound;12 per annum.&nbsp; There is also an allotment on
Whixall Moss, given in lieu of a right of turbury, which is let
for 5s. per annum.&nbsp; The rents are carried to the account of
the churchwardens of Wem quarter, and out of this account there
is paid, in respect of the rents above mentioned, and for Sir
Andrew Corbet&rsquo;s charity hereafter mentioned, 4s. a week,
amounting to &pound;10. 8s. per annum, which is disposed of in
bread, and &pound;3 of which is distributed in money.&nbsp; The
sum of &pound;3 is divided by the churchwardens and vestry clerk,
together with &pound;2 paid in respect of the Hon. Richard
Hill&rsquo;s charity, in small sums among the poor.</p>
<p><i>The Hon. Richard Hill</i>, in 1726, bequeathed &pound;100
to the poor of the parish of Wem, to be applied as the minister
and churchwardens should think fit.&mdash;<i>Rowland
Whittingham</i>, in the same year, bequeathed &pound;10 for the
objects of the said charity.&nbsp; With these two sums, and
&pound;2 advanced by the overseers, three messuages were
purchased adjoining the church-yard.&nbsp; These premises were
pulled down in the year 1822, and the site added to the
church-yard.&nbsp; Before this period, the rents never exceeded
&pound;5 or &pound;6 a year.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;2 has been
since paid out of the church-rate collected for Wem quarter, and
&pound;1 out of the rate collected for each of the other three
quarters.&nbsp; When the charity commissioners published their
report there was a sum of &pound;40 in the hands of Thomas
Wilkinson, which is understood to have been left many years ago
by Mr. Minshull of Tilley.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkinson pays 40s. yearly
as the interest thereof, of which 20s. is paid to the minister of
Whixall, 10s. among the poor of Wem, 5s. among the poor of Tilley
and Trench, and 5s. to the poor of Hollingwood End.</p>
<p><i>Sir Richard Hill</i>, by his will bearing date January 1st,
1808, bequeathed &pound;300 in trust to pay the interest of
&pound;100 to the poor of each of the parishes of Hodnet, Prees,
and Wem, in such proportions as his brother John Hill, during his
life, and after his decease, the owners of his mansion house, at
Hawkstone, should think fit.&nbsp; The interest on the sum of
&pound;100 is paid by Sir Rowland Hill to the poor of each of the
parishes of Hodnet and Prees.&nbsp; Nothing however was paid when
the charity commissioners visited Wem, in respect of the legacy
for Wem, nor had they any evidence to show the principal had ever
been paid.&nbsp; If the payment of the principal cannot be
proved, we apprehend that Sir Rowland Hill is accountable for it
as the representative of the testator.</p>
<p><i>Sir Andrew Corbet</i>, in 1817, gave the sum of 25 guineas,
the interest to be given to the poor of the parish.&nbsp; This
sum was applied in rebuilding the church, and the sum of 25s. is
paid out of the church-rate as the interest thereof, which sum is
expended in bread for the poor.</p>
<p><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span><i>Mary Hankey</i>, by will 1818, bequeathed &pound;40,
to be placed out at interest, and laid out in bread, to be
distributed every Easter Sunday among poor housekeepers of the
parish of Wem, at the discretion of the churchwardens.</p>
<p>Upwards of two hundred years ago there were three common
fields belonging the town: they consisted of arable land, and
were divided by stones or other land marks, so that each
proprietor knew his own ground, which he ploughed and sowed, but
when harvest was gathered in, their cattle ranged in common and
fed promiscuously.&nbsp; The cross field took its name from a
cross erected on that road, as was usual in popish
countries.&nbsp; The chapel field extended towards Horton, and
the middle field towards Edstaston road.</p>

<h4>ASTON</h4>
<p>is a scattered village and township one mile E. from Wem,
which contains 1,460<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 25<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
the soil of which in some parts is clay, in other parts a mixture
of mould, gravel, and sand prevails; the strong soils produce
excellent wheat.&nbsp; At the census in 1841 there were 47 houses
and 212 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;2,107.&nbsp;
There are 15<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 37<span class="smcap">p</span>. in roads
and waste.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Viscount Hill,
Major Dickin, John H. Walford, Esq., and Thomas Holly Cooke, Mrs.
James, Mrs. Nickson, the Duke of Cleveland, Sir Andrew Corbet,
Bart., Mrs. Griffiths, Mr. Caleb Powell, and the executors of the
late Mr. Gwynn and Mr. Hassall are also proprietors; Major Dickin
is lord of the manor.&nbsp; At the survey in 1561 there was only
one estate that was freehold in the township, and that was the
property of John Astley.&nbsp; The river Roden intersects the
township, and is crossed by bridges to Lee Brockhurst and
Aston.&nbsp; Barker&rsquo;s Green in this township is noted for
clay which makes a superior kind of bricks.&nbsp; Hill Cop Bank
is also in this township.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Aston
Hall</span>, an ancient structure built of timber and plaster, is
now occupied as a farm homestead.&nbsp; At the Domesday survey
the Astleys were seated here, from whom are descended the
Astleys, of Ashton; the estate was then of much larger
extent.&nbsp; It was afterwards sold to the Wilkinsons, and about
the year 1680 Lord Chancellor Jeffreys purchased this estate; it
is now the property of Mr. Thomas Holley Cooke.&nbsp; It is
stated on the table of benefactions that Ralph Wilkiss, of Aston,
left to the poor housekeepers of that township four nobles a
year, charged on Shaw&rsquo;s land in the said township.&nbsp;
The yearly sum of &pound;1. 6s. 8d. is paid out of the said land
now vested in the executors of Mr. Hassall, and is distributed in
small sums among the poor.</p>

<h4>COTTON,</h4>
<p>a pleasantly situated village and township three miles N. from
Wem, is variously written in ancient records as Cotton, Coton,
and Cooton, being derived from the Saxon, <i>cot</i>, a small
house, and <i>ton</i>, a town.&nbsp; The name may import that it
was a town consisting chiefly of small houses, such as were
usually built about woods by the poorer sort of people for the
conveniency of fuel.&nbsp; The township contains 1,703<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 7<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and is separated by four small
brooks from the townships that border on it; there are <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>30 acres in
roads and waste.&nbsp; At the census in 1841 there were 95 houses
and a population of 439 souls.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;2,774.&nbsp; The soil is a mixture of mould and clay,
naturally poor, but of late years has been much improved by
draining and superior cultivation; marl abounds in the township,
which is much used for top dressing the land.&nbsp; This was one
of the 28 lordships which Roger de Montgomery, Earl of
Shrewsbury, gave to William Pantulph.&nbsp; Cotton wood was one
of the five woods within the lordship of Wem.&nbsp; It is about
three miles in circumference, and still retains the name of wood,
although there is scarce a tree left on it.&nbsp; The chief
landowners are Viscount Hill, George Bowen, Esq., Mrs. Cooper, V.
Dolphin, Esq., the trustees of Wem school, Mr. Robert Sandland,
Mr. John Rodenhurst, Mr. Thomas Ashley, and Mr. William
Ikin.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Cotton Hall</span> in the time of
Edward IV. belonged to the Maddox family, and in the reign of
Elizabeth we find it possessed by Richard Ward, who in 1614
obtained license to eat flesh in Lent.&nbsp; The following is a
copy of the indulgence granted by Richard Sankey, rector of Wem,
as found in the parish register:&mdash;&ldquo;For that Richard
Ward, of Cotton, in the parish of Wem, and county of Salop,
gentleman, is notoriously sick, and enforced for the recovery of
his health to eat flesh for the time of his sickness.&nbsp;
Therefore I, Richard Sankey, parson of the said parish, forasmuch
as in me lieth by force of authority to me given by the statute
in the fifth year of our late sovereign lady Elizabeth, do
license the said Richard Ward to eat flesh according to the
contents of the said statute, by me, Richard Sankey, rector of
Wem.&nbsp; Registered according to the statute in presence, and
with the consent of the churchwardens for the time being, March
22nd of the same month, by reason of the continuance of the
forementioned sickness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cotton Hall is now a good
brick mansion, the residence and property of George Bowen, Esq.,
J.P.&nbsp; On the west side of Hill-lane stands the ancient
residence of the Cotons, who took their name from this township,
and are branched out into several families of
respectability.&nbsp; Ralph Coton, a draper, and lord mayor of
London in the 1st. of Charles I., was of this family.</p>

<h4>EDSTASTON,</h4>
<p>anciently written <span class="smcap">Edstanton</span>,
signifying the town of Edstan.&nbsp; This Edstan may probably
have been the founder of the chapel here, and had his seat on the
north side of it, where the site of an ancient building is still
visible.&nbsp; The fine north door of the chapel is opposite it,
and was probably made for the convenience of the family that
resided there.&nbsp; Edstaston is a township, chapelry, and
considerable but scattered village, two miles N.N. by E. from
Wem, having in 1841 95 houses and 452 inhabitants; in 1821 there
was a population of 397 souls.&nbsp; The township contains
2,018<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>.
2<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, of which 28<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 36<span
class="smcap">p</span>. are in roads and waste.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;3,385. 5s.&nbsp; The soil for the most part is a
cold clay, it has been greatly improved by draining, and there is
some good land for grazing purposes.&nbsp; The tithes are
commuted <a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>for &pound;298. 9s. 10d., payable to the rector of
Wem.&nbsp; The township is intersected by the Wem and Whitchurch
turnpike road, and a branch of the Ellesmere and Quino brook
canal.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Daniel Boote, Esq., V.
Dolphin, Esq., E. H. Chamberlain, Esq., Misses Knights, Mr.
Edward Holding, Mr. Edward Groom, Mr. Godfrey Lewin, Mr. Samuel
and James Lea, Mr. Walter Snape, Sir John Williams Bickerton,
Knight, Mr. John Walmsley, Henry John Barker, Esq., Mr. Samuel
Calcott, Mr. Phillips, Mr. Nickson, and others; the Duke of
Cleveland is lord of the manor.&nbsp; The new park was formerly
reckoned one of the five woods within the bounds of this
township, but it has been so well cleared of trees that no
remains of a wood are left.&nbsp; It was formerly enclosed with
pales and stocked with wild beast of chase.&nbsp; Chetal wood in
1561 was held by Arthur Mainwaring, at the rate of 6s. per
annum.&nbsp; There were formerly three common fields, the greater
part of which was enclosed upwards of two hundred years ago.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Chapel</span>, which is dedicated to
the Virgin Mary, in ancient writings is usually called our
Lady&rsquo;s chapel of Edstaston.&nbsp; The festival of the
nativity of the blessed Virgin being on the 8th of September, is
the day appointed for holding the feast or wake, if that day
happen on Sunday; if not, on the Sunday following.&nbsp; Mr.
Garbet is of opinion that this was a free chapel built by Edstan,
for the health and welfare of his own soul, as it lost its
endowment at the time of the general suppression of religious
houses in the reign of Henry VIII.&nbsp; In the times of popery
mass was sung here every day for the advantage of the deceased,
and on Sunday the usual church service was performed for the
living.&nbsp; It was not only independent of the rector of Wem,
but also free from the visitation of the bishop of Lichfield and
Coventry, who neither instituted nor inducted the incumbent, so
that in this respect it was much on the same footing as a
donative.&nbsp; The structure has a very ancient appearance, and
is 23 feet wide and 82 feet in length.&nbsp; It is entered by a
spacious porch of elaborate workmanship, built in 1710,
exhibiting the Norman style of architecture.&nbsp; It is neatly
pewed with oak sittings, and there is a gallery at the west end,
erected by private subscriptions and a grant from the Diocesan
Society amounting to &pound;84. 4s., in consequence of which the
sittings are free and unappropriated for ever.&nbsp; There are
some relics in the chancel of the superstition of popish times;
on each side of the altar are stands cut in stone, to bear the
tapers that usually burn there; on the east wall is a stone
jutting out, on which stood the image of the blessed Virgin, the
patroness of the chapel; near the altar is a recess probably used
for the preservation of the consecrated host, and in each of the
side walls is a stone basin to hold holy water.&nbsp; On the
north side of the altar there formerly stood a sacristy, or
vestry where the sacred utensils and priestly vestments are
kept.&nbsp; In 1723 a part of the west end wall of the chapel
fell down, and the roof was so much decayed that it was found
necessary to take the greatest part of it down.&nbsp; To lessen
the charge, a license was obtained from the bishop, to make the
chapel ten or eleven feet shorter than it had been.&nbsp; On the
south side is a window beautifully foliated and ornamented with
the family arms in stained glass, in memory of Admiral George
Bowen and his wife, of Cotton Hall.&nbsp; In the chancel is an
ancient mural tablet in memory of Richard Goldisborough; another
to John Knight, Esq., and one to Thomas Payne, gentleman, with
the date of 1760; a brass memorial remembers Richard Chambre,
Esq.&nbsp; The living is a curacy annexed to the rectory of
Wem.&nbsp; The Rev. John Stewart is the incumbent, and resides at
<span class="smcap">Edstaston House</span>, a handsome mansion of
brick, delightfully situated, and beautified with pleasure
grounds and shrubberries.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Creamore House</span> is a good residence,
occupied by John Unsworth, Esq.&nbsp; In Saxon times it belonged
to a person of consideration, whose mansion house stood at some
distance from the present dwelling, the site of which is
overgrown with brushwood; but the broad and deep moat that
surrounded it may still be traced.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Edstaston Hall</span>, a residence of considerable
antiquity, formerly the seat and property of the Mainwarings, is
now the residence of Daniel Boote, Esq.&nbsp; There are several
other respectable houses, <a name="page332"></a><span

<h4>LACON,</h4>
<p>a small township one and a half mile north-east from Wem, in
1841 had 12 houses and 84 inhabitants.&nbsp; It contains 398<span

various; in some places sandy, in other parts clayey; with
portions of moss land prevailing in other places.&nbsp; From the
latter large quantities of oak and fir timber have been raised,
from a depth of from sixteen to twenty feet below the
surface.&nbsp; The Wem and Market Drayton turnpike road

15s.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for the sum of &pound;122.
5s.&nbsp; Ralph Bannister was lord of the manor of Lacon in the
reigns of Edward IV. and Richard III.&nbsp; He had been brought
up by Humphrey Stafford, the great Duke of Buckingham, and put in
places of trust above all his servants.&nbsp; To his house the
duke retreated when he was deserted by his army in 1483.&nbsp; He
was proclaimed a traitor by the king, and lands of the value of
one hundred pounds a year; and a thousand pounds in ready money
were offered for his <a name="page333"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>discovery.&nbsp; This no doubt
tempted the cupidity of Bannister to betray his master, and John
Mytton, Esq., sheriff of the county, coming suddenly with a
strong body of armed men, apprehended the duke, disguised in the
garb of a peasant.&nbsp; Tradition says that the duke, falling on
his knees, cursed Bannister to the tenth generation.&nbsp; Sir
Thomas Moore, in his history of these times, takes notice of the
vengeance of heaven which soon after fell on this family, and
observes, &ldquo;Bannister&rsquo;s son and heir lost his senses,
and died mad in a hog-stye; his eldest daughter, of excellent
beauty, was suddenly stricken with foul leprosy; his second son
became a deformed cripple; a younger son was drowned in a small

<h4>LOWE AND DITCHES,</h4>
<p>a township one mile north-west from Wem, contains 668<span

class="smcap">p</span>. of land, of which 10<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 36<span
class="smcap">p</span>. are in roads and waste.&nbsp; In 1841
there were 16 houses and 98 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value
&pound;992. 15s.&nbsp; This place takes its name from its
situation on rising ground; <i>low</i>, in Saxon, signifying a
little hill; hence the tumuli, or mounds which the Danes raised
over the dead bodies of their famous men were called
&ldquo;lowes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name of &ldquo;Ditches&rdquo; may
have arisen from some remarkable fosses or ditches, of which
there are no remains or certain tradition.&nbsp; The soil is a
reddish clay or marl, with a mixture of mould.&nbsp; The
principal landowners are Lewin Jeffreys, Esq.; Mr. James Lea; Mr.
George Craig; Mr. John Richards; Mrs. Langford; Mrs. Nickson; Mr.
Forgham; Rev. Mr. Parkes; and the devisees of the late Mr.
Watson.&nbsp; The Duke of Cleveland is lord of the manor.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Ditches Hall</span>, an antique erection
chiefly composed of wood, was the seat of the Twyfords, a family
of consequence upwards of two centuries ago.&nbsp; It is a
commodious, lofty structure, now in the occupancy of Mr. Edward
Elkes, farmer.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Lowe Hall</span>,
formerly a place of consideration, was the residence of the Baron
family.&nbsp; The coat of arms, still in good preservation, has
the date of 1489.&nbsp; In the 5th of Henry VII., William Baron
of the Lowe was of the <i>Homage extra barram</i>, or country
jury.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Pym Farm</span> takes its
name from the circumstance of one Pym, at the beginning of the
civil war, having been murdered in a field a little below the
house, which was then covered with brushwood.&nbsp; He was the
tenant of this farm, which will probably bear his name when all
the ancient landlords are forgotten.&nbsp; This township is
crossed by the Wem, Ellesmere, and Loppington turnpike road.</p>

<h4>NEWTOWN</h4>
<p>is a chapelry and small village, four miles N.W. from Wem,
which in 1841 contained 16 houses and 79 inhabitants.&nbsp; The
township contains 639<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 26<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
of which 12<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 20<span class="smcap">p</span>. are in
roads and waste.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;844. 15s.&nbsp; The
Rector of Wem receives the tithes, which are commuted for
&pound;87. 14s. 6d.&nbsp; The chief landowners are Mrs. Maddocks,
Henry John Barker, Esq., Thomas Dickin, Esq., and Arthur Dickin,
Esq.; besides whom are several smaller proprietors.&nbsp; The
Duke of Cleveland claims the manorial rights.&nbsp; The roads to
Whixall, Northwood, Edstaston, and Wem, intersect the
township.&nbsp; About two centuries ago, the inhabitants of
Newtown, Wolverley, and Northwood, being at a great distance from
the parish church, agreed to have a <a name="page334"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 334</span><span class="smcap">Chapel of
Ease</span>, and for this purpose purchased a private house,
which was fitted up for divine worship, and procured a minister,
to whom the Rector of Wem gave a liberal stipend.&nbsp; The
register of Wem mentions the baptism of a child in Newtown
chapel, April 17th, 1659.&nbsp; In 1665 the owners of land
consented to settle &pound;10 per annum on a minister, and
charged that sum on their lands for ever.&nbsp; The Governors of
Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty, in 1754, made a grant of &pound;200 to
this chapel, which was subsequently laid out in the purchase of
freehold lands.&nbsp; It is remarkable, that Andrew Barton, who
was the last person born here when it was a private house, was
the first person that was buried here when it became a
consecrated chapel.&nbsp; He died, November 10th, 1666.&nbsp; In
the year 1836, the ancient structure was taken down, and a neat
edifice of brick erected on the site, at a cost of &pound;417.
12s. raised by subscriptions, which sum includes the expense of
fittings.&nbsp; It consists of nave, transepts, and square tower,
in which is one bell.&nbsp; The patronage is vested in the
inhabitants of the above townships which form the chapelry.&nbsp;
The living is returned at &pound;50 per annum, and is enjoyed by
the Rev. William Dixon, of Wem.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;There is an estate
at Newtown, charged with the payment of &pound;2. 10s. yearly, to
be given in bread to the poor attending divine service at the
chapel there.&nbsp; The donor of this gift is unknown.&nbsp;
<i>Arthur Harper</i>, in 1787, bequeathed &pound;90, upon trust,
to place the same out at interest, and apply the produce of
&pound;50 thereof in the relief of industrious housekeepers of
the townships of Newtown, Wolverley, and Northwood; and the
produce of &pound;40, the residue thereof to be distributed by
the churchwardens and overseers of the parish of Prees, in the
township of Darliston, on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; This
legacy had never been invested as directed by the testator, but
was in the hands of William Matthews, the surviving executor,
when the charity commissioners published their report.&nbsp; Mr.
Matthews pays interest for it at the rate of 4&frac12; per
cent.</p>

<h4>NORTHWOOD</h4>
<p>is a small rural village, on the borders of Flintshire, four
miles N.W. from Wem, which takes its name from the large wood
that was formerly here and its situation in respect of Lineal
Wood, which was south of it.&nbsp; The township contains
1,409<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>.
16<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and in 1841 had 47
houses and 233 inhabitants.&nbsp; There are 21<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 14<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land in roads and waste.&nbsp;
Rateable value, &pound;1,824.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for
&pound;181. 15s.&nbsp; The soil in some places is sandy, with a
mixture of gravel; in other places a clay soil prevails, and
there is a small portion of moss.&nbsp; In 1561 the township
contained six small tenements and four cottages.&nbsp; The great
wood was cut down during the reigns of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth,
so that nothing remains of it now but the name.&nbsp; The
principal landowners are Lord Kenyon, George Bowen, Esq., Mr.
James Rodenhurst, Mrs. Wilkinson, Mr. Bickerton, Mr. Lewis, Mr.
Groome, John Barker, Esq., the Devisees of the late Mr. Watson,
the Trustees of Wem School, Mrs. Maddocks, Mrs. Hassel, Mr.
Edward Dickin, Mr. Edward Phillips, Mr. Thomas Windsor, and Mr.
Walter Hales; others are also proprietors.&nbsp; The Duke of
Cleveland is lord of the manor.&nbsp; This township lies
contiguous to the Betchfield and Whixall mosses, where many of
the labouring population are employed in cutting the moss and
raising the submerged timber, which they carry to the surrounding
towns for fuel; immense quantities of oak and fir trees are
constantly got up.&nbsp; This and the neighbouring townships are
noted for producing fine dairies of cheese, and the farms are
occupied by practical and intelligent agriculturists.&nbsp;
Considerable flocks of sheep are kept on the borders of
Flintshire.&nbsp; The Redfellis brook has its rise on the fens of
Whixall moss, passes through Northwood, and enters Newtown with a
considerable stream, which, after heavy rains, overflows its
banks, and covers the adjacent meadows.&nbsp; The Blackford brook
divides Northwood from Flintshire.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Northwood Lawns</span>, the residence of Mrs.

<h4>SLEAP,</h4>
<p>a small township, two miles and a half S.W. from Wem, contains
407<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>.
32<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, of which 6<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. are in
roads.&nbsp; In 1841 there were seven houses and 57
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;580. 10s.&nbsp; Of the
above, one house and eleven persons were returned at the census
of 1841 as in the parish of Middle and in the Pimhill
hundred.&nbsp; The tithes have been commuted for &pound;72. 4s.
10d., and apportioned to the rector of Wem.&nbsp; The trustees of
the late Duke of Bridgewater are lords of the manor.&nbsp; The
principal landowners are William Groom, Esq., Henry John Barker,
Esq., Mrs. Thomas Betton, and the representatives of Miss
Lloyd.&nbsp; The soil is for the most part sandy or peaty earth
on a gravelly sub-soil.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry II. Richard
de Sleap had a grant of all the village at a fee-farm rent of
16s. per annum.&nbsp; The vassals of the said Richard de Sleap
and his heirs were obliged to grind their corn at the lord of the
manor&rsquo;s mill at Wem, to assist at drawing the mill stones,
and cleansing the pond, and to help Hugo Pantulph, then the lord,
to make his castle.&nbsp; The reserved rent of 16s. is still
paid; but homage ceased with the forest, the repair of the castle
at its demolition, working at the mill upon its alienation, and
the serving the king in his wars, upon the change of all tenures
by knights&rsquo; service into common socage.&nbsp; In 1738,
Sleap was laid in ashes by a sudden fire, which spread with such
rapidity, that three houses and all the outbuildings were
consumed.&nbsp; A brief was obtained for the unfortunate
sufferers.</p>
<p>The resident farmers are Benjamin Adams, John Chidlow, Thomas
Kent, John Phillips, and Robert Whall.</p>
<h4>SOULTON,</h4>
<p>a small township two miles north-east from Wem, contains
672<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>.
15<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and at the census of
1841 had 3 houses and 34 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;796.&nbsp; The soil in some parts is of a sandy nature; in
other places a clayey soil prevails.&nbsp; There are five and a
half acres in roads and waste.&nbsp; The tithes have been
commuted for &pound;96. 9s. 5d., and apportioned to the rector of
Wem.&nbsp; Viscount Hill is lord of the manor, and sole
proprietor.&nbsp; There are several thriving plantations here,
covering upwards of thirty acres of land.&nbsp; The Wem and
Market Drayton turnpike road intersects the township.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Soulton Hall</span> is a brick structure of
considerable extent, exhibiting a fine specimen of antique
architecture; the exterior has an imposing aspect, and the summit
is surrounded by a parapet.&nbsp; It was formerly a seat of the
Corbets, whose <a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>arms are carved over the entrance: it is now occupied
as a farm residence, and near it are extensive farm premises,
chiefly of modern erection, and on the granary is the date
1783.</p>
<p>The residents are George Bell, farmer, the Brook; Henry Dakin,
farmer, the Hall; and Thomas Williams, farmer, Dairy House.</p>
<h4>TILLEY AND TRENCH</h4>
<p>is a considerable village and township, situated one mile
south-west from Wem, which contains 1,636<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 36<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land; and in 1841 had 80 houses and
352 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;2,418. 5s.&nbsp;
The rent charge payable to the rector of Wem amounts to
&pound;263. 15s. 1d.&nbsp; The roads and waste in this township
occupy 25<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>.&nbsp; The soil is various: the Trench
farms are generally of a cold, reddish clay; in other parts a
loam and gravelly soil predominates.&nbsp; Marl of a superior
quality is found here in great abundance.&nbsp; This place no
doubt took its name from Sire Tillie, who is mentioned in the
list of great men who came into this country with William the
Conqueror.&nbsp; In the Trench farm there is a close called the
Castle Stead, that is, the place of the castle, whence it appears
a castle had been built there, which must have been in Saxon
times, for Pantulph the Norman fixed on Wem for the site of his
castle, and no other was built in this parish by his
ancestors.&nbsp; On an eminence a little above Tilley Green are
the remains of a Roman camp: it is an oblong square, and contains
about two acres of ground; the rampart and trench on every side
may still be traced.&nbsp; This was probably the site of the
manor house, for the Saxon lords frequently built their castles
on Roman camps, on account of the strength of such places and the
fortifications already raised.&nbsp; No doubt the Roman vallum
occasioned this to be called the Trench farm.&nbsp; The river
Roden bounds the township, and is crossed by a substantial bridge
at Wem Mills.&nbsp; The Duke of Cleveland is lord of the
manor.&nbsp; The principal landowners are William E. Jeffreys,
Esq.; Sir Andrew Corbet, Bart.; C. Howard, Esq.; Mr. John
Boughey; Colonel Wynn; A. D. Watkiss, Esq.; William Groom, Esq.;
Mr. George Kynaston; Charles Oldham, Esq.; Mr. Samuel Heatley;
Mr. William Kilvert; Mr. Bowers; Mr. Thomas Davies; Mr. Thomas
Wood; Mr. William Evans; Mrs. Richards; the executors of S.
Wycherley; and William Brooks, Esq.&nbsp; There is a noted
mineral spring in this township, which is reckoned good for sore
eyes and all cutaneous eruptions.&nbsp; William Price, a mason,
is said to have flagged the well in consideration of having been
cured of rheumatism by bathing in it.&nbsp; The old park,
Roowood, the property of Lord Hill, and Palm&rsquo;s Hill, are in
this township.&nbsp; The poor of this township have 28s. yearly,
from the bequest of <i>Sarah Higginson</i>, in 1727, who left
&pound;28, which was laid out in the purchase of a rent charge of
28s. per annum: the amount is now paid from land the property of
Major Dickin.</p>

<h4>WHITCHURCH</h4>
<p>is a parish and respectable market town salubriously situated
in a picturesque country, twenty miles N.N. by E. from
Shrewsbury, and 161 miles N.W. from London.&nbsp; The town is
well built, and stands on a gentle eminence, embracing many fine
points of view in the vicinity; there are many good inns and
shops and respectable private residences, but some of the
cottages have a mean appearance.&nbsp; The principal traffic is
in grain and malt, and commercial intercourse is facilitated by
the Ellesmere and Chester canal, and its contiguity to the
Chester and Crewe railway.&nbsp; The fairs and markets are well
attended by the agriculturists of the surrounding neighbourhood,
both of Shropshire and Cheshire.&nbsp; The populous township of
Dodington, of which a separate directory is given, may be
considered a suburb to Whitchurch.&nbsp; From the ancient name of
this place, which was <i>Album Monasterium</i>, or
<i>Blancminster</i>, it is supposed that a monastery formerly
existed here.&nbsp; Of this no account has been handed down, and
no traces of the building have ever been discovered.&nbsp; Bishop
Tanner says, &ldquo;Here was an hospital of several poor
brethren, to which John le Strange in the reign of Henry III.,
gave the town of Winelecote, which, together with the hospital,
was afterwards annexed to the abbey of Haughmon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whether this refers to a hospital at this place or at Oswestry
(since the Fitzallans, lords of Oswestry, were founders of the
abbey of Haughmon) is submitted to the reader&rsquo;s
determination.&nbsp; In the 7th of Edward III., John le Strange
had the liberty of free warren here, and in the 36th of the same
reign a fair was granted to John, son of John le Strange de
Whitchurch, on the vigil, the feast, and the morrow of the
apostles St. Simon and St. Jude.</p>
<p>The parish of Whitchurch comprehends the townships of
Alkington, Ash Magna, Ash Parva, Black Park, Brougnall, Chinnel,
Dodington, Edgeley, Hinton, Hollyhurst, Tilstock, Whitchurch,
Woodhouses New, and Woodhouses Old, which together in 1801
contained a population of 4,618 souls; 1831, 5,902, and in 1841
there were 1,243 houses and 6,373 inhabitants.&nbsp; Acres,
14,237.&nbsp; The parish is divided into four quarters or
divisions, viz., Whitchurch quarter, which contains 2,033 acres;
rateable value, &pound;6,196.&nbsp; Dodington quarter, 3,186
acres; rateable value, &pound;5,281.&nbsp; Tilstock quarter,
5,558 acres; rateable value, &pound;5,809, Broughall quarter,
3,497 acres; rateable value, &pound;3,089.&nbsp; The tithes of
Whitchurch are commuted for &pound;1,351, and of Marbury,
Norbury, and Wirswell an appendage to the rectory of Whitchurch
for &pound;398, making a total of &pound;1,749.&nbsp; The
township of Wirswell, although in the county of Cheshire, is in
the parish of Whitchurch.&nbsp; The town has a high steward, and
inferior officers; the former is appointed by the lord of the
manor, and holds a court leet and court baron.&nbsp; The land in
general has a gentle undulating surface, and there is a
considerable extent of pasture land in this locality of a
superior <a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>quality, which produces fine dairies of cheese, and is
generally considered as good as the celebrated Cheshire cheese of
the neighbouring county.&nbsp; The soil is various, on the low
grounds it is of a peaty nature, in some places a sand and
gravelly soil prevails, and in other parts a strong clay
predominates; marl is found in some places, which is used for
improving the surface soil.&nbsp; The township of Whitchurch
contains 2,867 acres of land, and in 1841 had 668 houses and
3,403 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;5,698. 10s.&nbsp;
The tithes of this township are commuted for &pound;247.
16s.&nbsp; The principal landowners are the trustees of the late
Earl of Bridgewater; Thomas Boycott, Esq.; George Harper, Esq.;
R. Parry Jones, Esq.; Thomas Jebb, Esq.; William Halstead Poole,
Esq.; Archibald Worthington, Esq., besides whom there are upwards
of two hundred small freeholders.&nbsp; The trustees of the late
Earl of Bridgewater are lords of the manor.&nbsp; The market is
held on Friday, when the town is well supplied with
butchers&rsquo; meat, butter, poultry, and other provisions, of
excellent quality and abundant in quantity.&nbsp; The corn market
is very numerously and respectably attended by the farmers of
North Shropshire, Cheshire, and the county of Flint, the town
lying on the verge of Shropshire is central for an extensive and
fine agricultural district in the three counties.&nbsp; Fairs are
held the second Friday in April, Whit-Monday, Friday after the
2nd of August, February 23rd, and December 1st.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a noble structure of
the Tuscan order, built in the reign of Queen Anne, at an expense
of about &pound;4,000, and will accommodate about 2,000
hearers.&nbsp; It is dedicated to St. Alkmund, and considered by
the best judges to be almost a perfect model of what a church
ought to be; it consists of nave, chancel, side aisles, and lofty
square tower adorned with pinnacles, and is built of red free
stone; the tower contains a peal of eight musical bells, and is
ornamented with a clock and sun dial,&mdash;the whole has an
imposing appearance, and for elaborate workmanship and chasteness
of design, is seldom equalled.&nbsp; The side aisles are
separated from the nave by arches rising from circular
pillars.&nbsp; The chancel is lofty and supported by fluted
columns, and paved with black and white marble.&nbsp; The
communion table is of mottled alabaster, with an oak frame
beautifully carved.&nbsp; The organ is a fine toned instrument,
which was renovated and greatly improved in the year 1849 by
public subscription.&nbsp; The sittings are neat and appropriate,
and admirably arranged, so that almost every member of the
congregation has a view of the officiating minister.&nbsp; The
church stands on the site of a former edifice, which was in the
gothic style of architecture, and which fell down from age and
decay, on July 31st, 1711.&nbsp; The monuments of the Talbots
were removed from the ruins of the old structure into the present
edifice, which was completed in the year 1713.&nbsp; Among the
most remarkable of these monuments is that to our <i>English
Achilles</i>, <i>Sir John Talbot</i>, the first Earl of
Shrewsbury of this family, who was so renowned in France that no
man in that kingdom dared to encounter him single handed.&nbsp;
The venerable old warrior is represented in a recumbent posture,
clad in armour, partly covered by his mantle of the garter; his
hands are closed and uplifted, as if in prayer; his feet rest on
a tablet, while his head, encircled by a coronet, reposes on his
brassart.&nbsp; Around the tomb is the following inscription in
black letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Orate pro anima pr&aelig;nobilis viri,
Domini Joanis Talbot quandam Comitis Salop&aelig;; Domini
Furnival, Domini Verdun, Domini Strange de Blackmere et
Marechalli Franci&aelig;; qui obiit in bello apud Berdews.&nbsp;
7 Julii, <span class="GutSmall">MCCCCLIII</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The earl was buried on this spot by his own express desire,
and tradition gives the following interesting story for the
circumstance:&mdash;In one of his battles in France, he was
struck by an arrow from one of the cross-bows, and fell severely
wounded from his horse.&nbsp; As he was some distance from any
considerable body of his troops, the French soldiers rushed
furiously to seize as a prisoner their most formidable and most
dreaded enemy; him alone whose name carried terror into every
castle and cottage through the broad realm of France;&mdash;or,
if foiled in that, to finish if possible the campaign and his
career at one blow.&nbsp; His faithful body guard, however, which
was composed of his own <a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>immediate followers, those who held
lands of him in Shropshire by feudal service, seeing the danger
of their beloved chief, flew like roused lions to the
rescue.&nbsp; A terrific conflict ensued around, and even over
the old warrior who was still lying on the field.&nbsp; The
struggle was maintained with undiminished fury for a considerable
period.&nbsp; The shout of &ldquo;St. George for Merry
Englande,&rdquo; was fiercely answered back by the cry of
&ldquo;St. Denis for France.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each party fought hand
to hand; the casques of the combatants rang with the heavy blows
of the battle-axe.&nbsp; Not only the fate of the present battle,
but of the whole campaign, the war itself depended on the result
of the isolated combat.&nbsp; Many a stalwart Shropshire yeoman
shouted from his hoarse throat his leader&rsquo;s war cry,
&ldquo;A Talbot, to the rescue!&rdquo; threw aside his weapon,
which in the thronged <i>melee</i> he had not space to use, and
springing furiously at his adversary, seized him with an iron
grip, from which death alone could liberate him.&nbsp; The
conflict ended at last in the entire defeat of the French; and
the earl, to show his gratitude to his brave followers, many of
whom had lost their lives in defending his, told the survivors
that in memory of their courage and devotedness that day, his
body should be buried in the porch of their church; that, as they
had fought and strode over it while living, so should they and
their children for ever pass over and guard it when dead.&nbsp;
Sir John Talbot was created Earl of Shrewsbury by King Henry
VI.&nbsp; He was twenty years in the king&rsquo;s service abroad,
and for his valour had many signal honours bestowed on him.&nbsp;
At the siege of Chastillion his horse was shot under him, and he
being dangerously wounded, died July 20th, 1453, and was buried
at Roan in Normandy, but afterwards removed to Whitchurch.</p>
<p>There is an altar tomb, with a full length alabaster figure in
clerical robes, in memory of Sir John Talbot, rector of
Whitchurch, which was also taken out of the old church.&nbsp;
There are various memorials and tablets, elegantly designed,
which our limits will not allow us to notice, in memory of the
Boycotts, Fowlers, Balls, Chetwoods, Sandfords, Longs, and
others.&nbsp; A mural monument remembers Philip Henry, M.A.,
father of Matthew Henry, the commentator.&nbsp; The font is of
curious workmanship, and dated 1661.&nbsp; The Book of Martyrs,
chained to the wall, was the gift of Mr. Thomas Yates, in the
year 1701, for the instruction and use of the public.&nbsp; An
oil painting of the royal arms of England is very ancient; and
there is a fine specimen of embroidery of the arms of England,
with a portrait of Queen Anne, beautifully executed in
needlework.&nbsp; The church is heated by a most perfect hot
water apparatus, admirably contrived.&nbsp; The living is a
rectory, with that of Marbury annexed; valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;44. 11s. 8d.; now returned at &pound;2,004; in the
patronage of the trustees of the late Earl of Bridgewater, and
incumbency of the Rev. William Egerton, M.A.; curates, Rev.
Edward Pickering, Rev. John Thomas Nash, and Rev. Robert R.
Turnbull; clerk, Richard Crosse.&nbsp; The rectory is a
commodious and pleasantly situated residence, a short distance
from the church, with pleasure grounds and shrubberies tastefully
laid out.&nbsp; There are 35<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span

Baptists have also a Sunday school in connection with their
chapel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Free Grammar School</span> and
residence for the master is a noble pile of buildings, situated
in Bargates street, and was erected in the year 1548.&nbsp; The
school is a chaste and elegant structure, ornamental to the town,
and highly creditable to the feoffees under whose auspices it was
erected.&nbsp; The school was founded in 1550, and we find in the
preamble to the schedule of a deed of feoffment, bearing date
16th September, 1550, that Sir John Talbot, late parson of
Whitchurch, was resolved to have founded in his lifetime <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>a free
school in the town of Whitchurch, at his own expense, for the
bringing up of youth in virtue and learning; and that he had
delivered into the hands of Thomas Cotton the sum of &pound;200
towards the erection and establishment of the said school, but
that the said Sir John Talbot died before the accomplishment of
the same; and that with the said sum and other moneys given by
charitably disposed persons, there had been purchased a messuage
called Cow Hall, to the intent that they should observe the
several articles contained in the deed of feoffment.&nbsp; The
substance of the statutes contained in this deed is,&mdash;That
the feoffees, with the parson of the parish, if he should be
inhabiting there, should within six weeks after the death,
departure, or removal of any schoolmaster appoint another
unmarried man, if he could be conveniently provided, and if not a
married man&mdash;honest, virtuous, and well learned in Latin and
literature&mdash;to be schoolmaster there, such schoolmaster to
be presented, within eight days after his election, to the
diocesan or his chancellor to be examined, and if he should be
thought competent on such examination, then to be admitted.&nbsp;
That if the feoffees and parson should not appoint within six
weeks, the Earl of Shrewsbury should appoint a master.&nbsp; That
if any of the feoffees should depart out of the parish and reside
elsewhere, he should release his interest to the other
feoffees.&nbsp; The master was to receive &pound;10 per annum,
and to have the appointment of the usher, who was to receive five
marks yearly.&nbsp; That the feoffees should not demise any of
the premises for more than ten years, and that they should yearly
account in the parish church of Whitchurch for the rents and
profits of the same.&nbsp; If the rents and profits should at any
time exceed the sum before appointed to be paid to the
schoolmaster and usher, the feoffees should deliver the overplus
to the churchwardens, to be kept in a chest in the said church,
for the repairs of the schoolhouse, and for the relief of such
schoolmaster as should have laudably taught in the said school,
until by sickness or age he should have given over, or have been
removed from his place, and for the relief of poor fatherless and
friendless scholars.&nbsp; That after the death or removal of a
schoolmaster, the usher should be elected in his place if he
should be thought by the parson and feoffees learned and meet for
the same.&nbsp; That there should be taught in the school
children of &ldquo;all countries that will come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
William Thomas, in 1662, conveyed 16 acres of land in the parish
of Ubley, in the County of Somerset; two thirds of the rent to be
paid to the master of this school and one third to the
usher.&nbsp; Edward Beddon and Ann, his wife, left certain lands,
the rents to be employed to the sole use of the school at
Whitchurch.&nbsp; All the real estates above-mentioned, with the
school and other premises held therewith, have from time to time
been conveyed to new trustees.&nbsp; In 1725 proceedings in
Chancery took place between the master and usher and the then
trustees.&nbsp; The matters in dispute were the amount of the
salaries to which the schoolmaster and usher were entitled, the
right of the master to take any payments from the scholars, and
the right of the trustees to remove the master from his
office.&nbsp; By a decree, made 16th December, 1725, it was
ordered that the schoolmaster should have only &pound;10 per
annum, and the usher five marks from the Cowhall estate; that the
rest of the profits should go to the uses mentioned in the
statutes; that the rents of the Ubley estate should be divided as
directed by the donor; and the rent of the Beddow estate in like
manner; and it was declared that it was the intention of the
donor that all people&rsquo;s children should be taught in the
said school gratis, and that the rector and feoffees had power to
remove the master.&nbsp; In a subsequent cause, between the
Attorney-General, at the relation of the Bishop of Hereford, it
was decreed, on March 21st, 1747, that there should be paid to
the head master &pound;13. 6s. 8d., and to the usher &pound;6.
13s. 4d. in addition to their former salaries, and so much as
should remain after the payment of repairs and other incidental
expenses relating to the school should be deposited in the chest;
that whenever &pound;100 should have arisen from such surplus,
the same might be placed out on government securities for the
augmentation of the salaries of the master and usher, in the
proportions of two thirds to the former and one third to the
latter, until such time as there should be a decayed master or
poor scholar entitled to <a name="page341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>a subsistance according to the
donor&rsquo;s intention.&nbsp; The Cowhall estate is situate at
Backford, in Cheshire, and consists of 153<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 37<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, with a farm house and suitable
outbuildings, let at a yearly rent of &pound;200, but the
trustees, in 1822, agreed to allow the tenant &pound;20 per
annum, to be laid out in manure.&nbsp; In the year 1822, timber
was cut from this farm and sold for &pound;200, which was partly
applied in repairing the farm premises: the residue, &pound;80
13s. 10d., was paid to the trustees.&nbsp; The Ubley estate, near
Bristol, consists of 26<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 4<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
and is let for &pound;30 a year.&nbsp; There is also a yearly sum
of &pound;52 arising from lands the gift of Edward Beddow.&nbsp;
The trustees, when the charity commissioners published their
report, were possessed of &pound;6,400 in three per cent.
consols, which has arisen from the investment of surplus rents,
in accordance with the decree of Chancery.&nbsp; The gross annual
income amounts to &pound;454, from which the master had a salary
of &pound;210. 8s. 6d., and the usher &pound;97 per annum.&nbsp;
Upon application being made to the trustees, on behalf of orphan
or friendless children, such as are considered fit objects, are
appointed at a meeting of the trustees, they also receive
clothing and are supplied with books.&nbsp; The Rev. James R.
Peake, M.A., is the master.</p>

343</span>During the years 1830 and 1831, the inhabitants of
Whitchurch and the neighbourhood were held in constant alarm by a
succession of incendiary fires.&nbsp; On the 14th of December the
first fire commenced on the premises of a poor man of the name of
Heath.&nbsp; On the following day the out-buildings of the Swan
Inn burst into flames; and on the 21st the out-premises belonging
to Mr. Nunnerley, of Prees Heath, were destroyed.&nbsp; On the
7th of January, 1831, Mr. Moss, of Heath lane, had a stack burnt;
and on the day following the barn of Mr. G. T. Whitfield and two
cottages were destroyed.&nbsp; On the 12th, a barn belonging to
the same gentleman was discovered to be on fire.&nbsp; A stack
was fired belonging to Mr. Huxley on the 2nd of February.&nbsp;
On the 10th of March, a second fire broke out on the premises of
Mr. Nunnerley, of Prees Heath, and so rapid were the flames that
the whole of the out-buildings were entirely destroyed before the
arrival of the fire-engines from Whitchurch.&nbsp; Five cows, two
horses, and ten pigs, were also destroyed.&nbsp; The next fires
which took place were the stacks of Mr. Bradbury.&nbsp; On the
4th of April, the farm buildings of Mr. Huxley, of Tilstock, and
a great quantity of grain, were entirely consumed.&nbsp; The same
evening, a range of buildings, on the road from Prees Heath to
Tilstock, burst into flames, and the fire proceeded with so much
rapidity that no efforts could check them.&nbsp; On the 13th of
September, a stack belonging to Mr. Nunnerley, of Prees Heath,
was consumed.&nbsp; The stack-yard and out buildings of Mr.
Booth, and the stacks of Mr. Darlington, were in flames at the
same time, and very great damage sustained.&nbsp; Shortly after
this the incendiaries were brought to justice, and Richard
Whitfield, a farmer and maltster, was transported for life, at
the Shropshire Spring Assizes of 1832, and James Lea and Joseph
Grindley were executed.</p>
<p>Whitchurch was the birth place of Dr. <span
class="smcap">Tylston</span>, an eminent physician in 1663.&nbsp;
He was admitted into Trinity College, Oxford, and his brilliant
talents adorned by a deportment in all respects exemplary soon
attracted the notice of Dr. Bathurst, then president of the
college, whose able directions much assisted him.&nbsp; When
about Bachelor&rsquo;s standing, his inclinations suggested the
study of physic, as the employment for life, and having by an
acquaintance with natural philosophy laid a good foundation for
medical enquiries, he speedily turned the course of his reading
into that channel.&nbsp; After he had left college he removed to
London, where he studied industriously under Sir Richard
Blackmore.&nbsp; On his return he commenced his professional
career at Whitchurch, and though young, quickly obtained
celebrity.&nbsp; At the request of many friends in Chester he
quitted his native town for that city in the year 1690, and by
successful practice continued to increase in fame.&nbsp; His
mental powers rose above the ordinary standard, and in the
prosecution of an enquiry he regarded the opinions of others
rather as guides to direct than authoratitives to govern the
efforts of his own mind.&nbsp; After his attainments had become
considerable, such was his thirst for knowledge that he redeemed
for study all the time his professional engagements would
allow.&nbsp; The writings of antiquity, especially those of
Cicero, Seneca, and Plutarch, afforded him great delight.&nbsp;
In the works of Pliny he took much pleasure, and shortly before
his death read with great satisfaction the writings of
Lactantius.&nbsp; Passages which illustrated any portion of
Scripture he transcribed into an interleaved Bible, or other
repository.&nbsp; In his professional pursuits he was as
remarkable for charity to the poor as for diligence, fidelity,
and concern for his patients.&nbsp; The Scriptures he perused
with unfeigned delight, and was influenced by their authority as
a supreme rule.&nbsp; By frequent meditation he became conversant
in an unusual degree with the instructive doctrines and sublime
mysteries of the Gospel.&nbsp; When a subject particularly
interesting filled his attention, he clothed his conceptions in
writing; these have survived him, and not only show the evidences
of erudition, but of an experimental acquaintance with revealed
religion.&nbsp; He died on the 8th of April, 1699, in the 36th
year of his age.&nbsp; The celebrated Matthew Henry bears
honourable testimony to his worth, in a letter to a friend
shortly after his death, from which the following is an
extract:&mdash;&ldquo;I find it easy to say a great deal to
aggravate the <a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>affliction we are under in the death of Dr. Tylston,
whom we miss daily.&nbsp; What improvement I have made in
learning of late years has been owing as much to my converse with
him as to any one thing.&nbsp; He was the ornament of our
congregation, and a great reputation to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This town was the residence of Nicholas Barnard, a man of
great learning, chaplain to Archbishop Usher, and Dean of
Armagh.&nbsp; In the time of the rebellion in Ireland he was a
great sufferer, and often in danger of his life; he consequently
fled to England, and was presented with the rectory of
Whitchurch, where he lived till his death in 1661.&nbsp; Abraham
Wheloch, a person of great learning, and noted as a linguist of
distinguished abilities, was born in this town.&nbsp; He was
author of a Persian translation of the New Testament, which task
he undertook in the hope that it might open the way for the
conversion of the natives of Persia to Christianity.&nbsp; He
greatly assisted Dr. Brian Walton in his Polyglot Bible, and
published an edition of the works of the venerable Bede.&nbsp; He
was fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, library keeper, Arabic
professor, and minister of St. Sepulchre&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His death
took place in 1654.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Samuel
Higginson</i>, by will, bearing date 28th September, 1697,
devised certain lands in Whixall, and gave the sum of &pound;200
in trust, for the erection of an almshouse, and the benefit of
poor persons appointed as inmates; and if any poor relations of
the family or kin should apply, he directed that they should be
first admitted to receive the benefit thereof.&nbsp; Jane
Higginson, widow of the above Samuel Higginson, by her will, in
1707, gave &pound;5 per annum to five decayed tradesmen&rsquo;s
widows in Ludlow, in consideration that the five poor widows
should take care to keep the chancel in Ludlow church
clean.&nbsp; She also gave to the rector of Ludlow and his
successors &pound;5 per annum.&nbsp; And she gave all her lands
and tenements in the counties of Salop, Flint, and Chester, in
trust, and after payment of certain legacies, she gave for the
use of her own and her husband&rsquo;s almhouse in Whitchurch
&pound;12 per annum, charged upon her estate at Ash, in the
county of Chester, the necessary repairs of the almshouse to be
first deducted thereout; and she directed that the sum of
&pound;7. 10s. per annum, given by her daughter for the support
of the said almshouse, should also be paid out of her estate at
Ash.&nbsp; She also gave to the poorest and most necessitous
children of the parish of Hanmer the sum of &pound;6, payable
once in five years, whereof 20s. was designed for their clothing,
and the rest to be bestowed for the benefit of the children, and
&pound;6 in like manner to the parish of Ellesmere.&nbsp; And she
gave the debts due to her to build a schoolhouse upon the piece
of ground lying between her almshouses and those of the town, and
bequeathed &pound;10 per annum to the teacher, and 20s. yearly to
buy English books.&nbsp; She directed her trustees to meet on the
24th June, yearly, to settle the accounts, and left 30s. yearly
for their expenses, and 10s. to the minister to preach a sermon
on the same day.</p>
<p>Under the will of Samuel Higginson, an almshouse was built
consisting of six tenements, and also a schoolhouse.&nbsp; These
premises, with small gardens attached to the almshouses, comprise
the whole of the property devised by him in Whitchurch, except a
small parcel which was sold to the parish for &pound;10, for the
purpose of building other almhouses thereon.&nbsp; The Whixall
estate consists of about 22 acres of land, producing a yearly
rental of &pound;42.&nbsp; The property devised by Mrs. Higginson
consists of a messuage and land containing 110<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 20<span
class="smcap">p</span>. let at a rent of &pound;140.&nbsp;
Certain lands and a house at Milton Green, comprising in the
whole 40<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 30<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
producing a yearly rental of &pound;40.&nbsp; The trustees took
no estate at Ash in the county of Chester, and the yearly sum of
&pound;12 left as payable out of the Ash estate to the almspeople
is considered as payable out of her other estates.&nbsp; The
rents above mentioned amounts to &pound;252 per annum, out of
which each of the almspeople receive &pound;4. 4s. yearly at
Midsummer, and &pound;2. 2s. on each of the <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>other
quarter days.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;6 is transmitted every
fifth year to Hanmer; and a yearly stipend of &pound;10 and an
allowance of &pound;2 for coal is paid to the master of the
national school, who teaches the boys in a school erected by
subscriptions for that purpose; the girls are taught in the
school adjoining the almshouse, built according to the directions
of Mrs. Higginson.&nbsp; Out of the residue &pound;15. 15s. is
distributed among the poor of Great Ash, Little Ash, and
Tilstock, and a considerable amount is given in small sums to the
poor of Whitchurch and the vicinity.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Benyon</i>, in 1707, charged certain premises in the
township of Alkington with the payment of 40s. per annum, for the
benefit of the preaching minister of the then new erected
Presbyterian meeting house in Dodington, to continue so long as
such minister should officiate there and no longer, and that the
residue of the yearly rents should be applied in educating so
many poor children of the parish of Whitchurch as could be
conveniently taught therein; and he directed that if preaching at
the said meeting house should cease, or none be there by a
Presbyterian minister, the said payment of 40s. should cease, and
be applied for educating the said poor children.&nbsp; The
property devised by Mr. Benyon contains 22<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 14<span
class="smcap">p</span>., and is let for &pound;50 per
annum.&nbsp; The nomination of the free scholars is left to the
members of the Presbyterian congregation, instead of being
appointed by the trustees, as directed by the testator.</p>
<p><i>Mary Whetton</i>, by her will, bearing date March, 1811,
gave to the rector of Whitchurch &pound;100, navy five per
cents., in trust, to pay the interest half yearly among the
widows of Higginson&rsquo;s almshouses.&nbsp; A portion of this
stock having been sold for the payment of the legacy duty, and
the navy five per cents. having been converted into new four per
cents., there is now in respect of this charity &pound;94. 10s.
new four per cents., standing in the name of certain
trustees.&nbsp; The dividends, amounting to &pound;3. 15s. 6d.,
are distributed as directed by the donor.</p>
<p><i>Phillip&rsquo;s Charity</i>.&mdash;The particulars of James
Phillip&rsquo;s charity for the providing a lecture every
Thursday in the parish church of Whitchurch, and for the
supplying the poor with flannel, will be found in the account of
the charities for the town of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p><i>John Gossage</i>, by will, 1671, gave to the poor of the
parish of Whitchurch the sum of &pound;2. 12s. per annum, to
provide twelve pennyworth of bread every Lord&rsquo;s day.&nbsp;
He also gave a similar bequest to the poor of the parish of
Plumstead, in Kent, and for the payment of the same he charged
his lands in Plumstead and Erith, and gave the residue of the
proceeds to St. Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp; This rent charge
is received from the treasurer of St. Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital,
and distributed to the poor in bread.</p>
<p><i>Ralph Brereton</i>, haberdasher, of London, by his will,
date May 1st, 1630, among other charities bequeathed &pound;250
to purchase a yearly dole for ever for the poor of
Whitchurch.&nbsp; In 1635 this bequest was laid out in the
purchase of 21 acres of land in Edgeley, and this land was sold
in the year 1804 for the sum of &pound;1,230.&nbsp; This sale was
supposed to have been authorized by an act of parliament, passed
32nd George III., for building a house of industry at Whitchurch,
whereby it was enacted that all lands, rents, hereditaments, and
sums of money, and all charitable gifts, legacies, and
benefactions belonging to the parish of Whitchurch, and
applicable to the relief of the poor, not being directed by the
donors to be applied to any private person, or for the relief of
any particular poor, should be invested in the directors who were
thereby incorporated.&nbsp; And it was thereby declared that it
should be lawful for them to dispose of the same, and apply the
money for carrying on the purposes of the act, or otherwise in
aid of the poor&rsquo;s rate.&nbsp; At the time the property was
sold it was let for &pound;17 a year, and this sum has been paid
annually by the directors of the house of industry to the
churchwardens, to be disposed of as the charity of Ralph
Brereton.&nbsp; The amount is added to the yearly sums of
&pound;2 12s. paid from Gossages charity, &pound;1 from
Griffith&rsquo;s charity, and &pound;8 from the church rate,
probably in respect of some benefactions which were applied many
years ago in rebuilding the church.&nbsp; From this fund eleven
dozen penny loaves are distributed <a name="page346"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 346</span>every Sunday, ten penny loaves in
Tilstock chapel, and the remainder in the parish church.</p>
<p>A yearly sum of &pound;1, left by Morris Griffith, is charged
on land called the Green Field, an estate belonging to Mrs. Ann
Brown, whose tenants pay the amount, which is added to the
produce of Brereton&rsquo;s charity.&nbsp; Several sums of money
left at different periods and by various donors, amounting in the
whole to &pound;340, were held by the church-wardens and
overseers for the use of the poor; of this sum &pound;300 was
laid out in the purchase of a rent charge issuing out of certain
land in Alkington.&nbsp; The yearly sum of &pound;15 is paid to
the treasurer of the house of industry, and it is applied for the
general purposes of that establishment in pursuance of the
provisions contained in the act of 32nd George III., already
noticed in the account of Brereton&rsquo;s charity.&nbsp; Of the
above sum &pound;55 was the gift of John Taylor, in consideration
of which one dozen of penny loaves are distributed every Sunday,
according to the intentions of the donor.&nbsp; The residue of
the sum of &pound;340 was probably laid out with other money, as
hereafter mentioned.</p>
<p>The churchwardens and overseers of the poor, in the year 1699,
purchased an estate in Broughall, with the sum of &pound;100, the
gift of <i>Edward Williams</i>, and a further sum of &pound;110,
part of the poors&rsquo; money.&nbsp; It does not appear what
specific benefactions were comprised in the sum of &pound;110
above mentioned.&nbsp; There are, however, a great number of
gifts and legacies recorded in the church, to the amount of
&pound;492; and in the purchase of the Broughall and Alkington
estates, before mentioned, &pound;410 is accounted for.&nbsp; It
is probable that the residue, with some other money, was laid out
in re-building the church, and was the origin of the payment of
the sum of &pound;8 from the church rates, which is distributed
in bread, as already mentioned under the head of Brereton&rsquo;s
charity.&nbsp; The estate at Broughall consists of 14 acres, and
is let at a rent of &pound;21 per annum, one-fourth of which has
always been paid to the master of the grammar school, and
three-fourths to the account of the directors of the house of
industry, under the provisions of an act to which we have before
alluded.</p>
<p>At a court held for the manor of Whitchurch, 26th January,
1630, John Rawlinson D.D., and Catherine his wife, surrendered
certain lands to the use of Richard Alport, and Joyce his wife,
in tail, and for want of issue, to the use of Richard Alport and
his heirs, they paying &pound;12 yearly out of the said lands to
the churchwardens of Whitchurch, to the use of the poor of the
said parish.&nbsp; The estate thus charged with the yearly
payment of &pound;12 lies near the town of Whitchurch, and is now
called Alport&rsquo;s land.&nbsp; It was in the possession of the
assignees of Samuel Fowles, when the charity commissioners
published their report.&nbsp; The amount is distributed among the
poor of the parish on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; It is stated
in the parliamentary returns of 1786, that a Mr. Cotton left a
rent charge of &pound;4 yearly to the poor of Whitchurch.&nbsp;
The sum of &pound;4 is now paid in respect of this charity from
the Alkington hall estate.&nbsp; The churchwardens receive
&pound;9 annually, about November, from the Company of Drapers in
London, as the amount of the gifts of <i>Roger Cotton</i>,
<i>William Cotton</i>, and <i>Sir Allen Cotton</i>.&nbsp;
Thirty-two sixpenny loaves are given away to poor persons as the
charity of Mr. Evans, on Good Friday.</p>
<p><i>Clement Sankey</i>, <i>D.D.</i>, rector of Whitchurch, by
his will bearing date 27th September, 1706, gave to the poor of
this parish the sum of &pound;100, to continue under the care of
the overseers of the poor and their successors; half the interest
to be disposed of in bread every Lord&rsquo;s day, at their
discretion, and the remainder to be distributed on St.
Thomas&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; The amount of this legacy was paid to
the churchwardens in 1714, and applied towards the building of
the church; half the interest is paid from the church rate, and
the other half from the poors&rsquo; rate.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Turton</i>, in 1794, bequeathed &pound;500 in
trust, to be laid out in government or other securities, as her
trustees should think fit, the profits thereof to be distributed
among poor persons belonging to the parish of Whitchurch.&nbsp;
By a codicil to her will, dated 1796, the testatrix directed that
the residue of her estate and effects, subject to the <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>payment of
her debts and legacies, should be converted into money, and the
produce paid to the same trustees, for the benefit of the
poor.&nbsp; John Hand, one of the trustees named in her will,
gave &pound;200 upon the same trusts, and in augmentation of the
charity.&nbsp; From the legacy of &pound;500 bequeathed,
&pound;30 was deducted as legacy duty, and the residue was
invested in 1801, in the purchase of &pound;839. 8s. 4d. three
per cent. consols.&nbsp; The following stock has been
subsequently purchased, with the produce of the residuary estate,
viz., November, 1801, &pound;200; January, 1805, &pound;800;
July, 1816, &pound;100; November, 1816, &pound;200; and in 1818,
in order to make &pound;2,200, &pound;60. 11s. 8d. was
purchased.&nbsp; For the distribution of these charities, the
trustees meet annually, three weeks or a month before the 19th of
January, and select such poor widows, poor housekeepers, and
other poor persons belonging to the parish of Whitchurch, and not
receiving parochial relief, as they think the most fit objects of
charity.&nbsp; Each poor person receives from 5s. to 20s.,
according to the necessities of the case.</p>
<p><i>Richard Woollam</i>, by his will, bearing date June 23rd,
1801, bequeathed &pound;500 in trust, to place the same out on
real or personal security, and to dispose of the produce weekly
in threepenny loaves, to be distributed by the churchwardens
every Sunday morning, after divine service, in the parish
church.&nbsp; When the trustees, by death or removal from the
parish, should be reduced to two, the testator directed the
survivors to assign the trust money to three other persons
resident in the parish of Whitchurch.&nbsp; This legacy has been
invested in the funds, and the dividends are disposed of as
directed by the donor.</p>
<p><i>Brereton Grafton</i>, in 1811, bequeathed &pound;300 stock
in the three per cent. consols, upon trust, to apply the produce
weekly in the purchase of threepenny loaves, to be disposed of in
like manner with Woollam&rsquo;s charity.&nbsp; In respect of
this and Woollam&rsquo;s gift, there is &pound;1,120. 2s, 7d.
three per cent. consols standing in the name of trustees, and the
dividends, amounting to &pound;33. 12s. per annum, are disposed
of in the purchase of bread, which is given away every
Sunday.</p>
<p><i>Francis Henry Egerton</i>, <i>Earl of Bridgewater</i>, by
his will, bearing date 29th August, 1828, bequeathed to the
overseers and churchwardens of Whitchurch-cum-Marbury,
&pound;2,000, to be by them laid out in the public funds, and the
dividends thereof to be expended by the rector for the time
being, according to his sole will and pleasure, without being
subject to any control whatsoever, for the use, benefit and
relief of the poor of the said parish.</p>

class="smcap">Bletchmore</span>, one mile and a half N.E. from
Whitchurch, is noted as the birth-place of John Talbot, the first
Earl of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; He was the second son of Sir Richard
Talbot, of Goodrich Castle, in Herefordshire; and on the death of
his elder brother, he became heir to that family.&nbsp; John
Talbot, who was called to Parliament by Henry IV. by the title of
Lord Furnival (having married the eldest daughter of that
nobleman), was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1412,
and Lord Lieutenant in 1414.&nbsp; In 1420 he accompanied Henry
V. to France, where he remained till the death of that
monarch.&nbsp; He afterwards served in France under the Regent
(the Duke of Bedford), and by his exploits rendered his name more
terrible to the foe than that of any other English officer.&nbsp;
He was afterwards raised to the rank of general, and commanded
the troops which were sent into the province of Maine to the
succour of the Earl of Suffolk, and made himself master of
Alencon.&nbsp; He joined the Earl of Salisbury at the siege of
Orleans, which failed through the intervention of the celebrated
Maid of Orleans, under whose guidance the French recovered their
lost courage, became assailants in their turn, and defeated the
English at Patai, where Talbot was taken prisoner.&nbsp; He
obtained his liberty by ransom, and raising fresh troops,
recrossed the sea, and defeated the French in several
engagements.&nbsp; For these and other services he was raised to
the dignity of Marshal of France, and the title of Earl of
Shrewsbury was conferred upon him.&nbsp; He was a second time
sent to Ireland as lord lieutenant, and the earldom of Wexford
and Waterford in that kingdom was added to his honours.&nbsp; In
1541, the English influence in France continuing to decline,
Talbot was again sent thither, and constituted Lieutenant
General, with extraordinary powers.&nbsp; His presence restored
success; he took Bordeaux, and brought back several other places
to their allegiance to the English crown.&nbsp; He afterwards
marched to the relief of Chastillon, and made an attack on the
enemy, when he was shot in the thigh by a cannon ball, and soon
after died, at the age of eighty years.&nbsp; In this engagement
one of his sons was slain, the English were defeated, and the
consequence was their total expulsion from France.&nbsp; The
remains of this celebrated general were interred at Whitchurch,
where a splendid monument was raised to his memory, which has
been previously noticed.&nbsp; Blackmere is a noted and extensive
sheet of water in this township, well stocked with fish.</p>

<h2>THE SOUTH BRADFORD HUNDRED.</h2>
<p>The South Bradford Hundred is bounded on the north by North
Bradford Hundred, on the east by the county of Stafford, on the
south by the Brimstree and Condover Hundreds and the Wenlock
Franchise, and on the west by Albrighton Division and the
Shrewsbury Liberty.&nbsp; The hundred is divided into the Newport
and Wellington Divisions.&nbsp; The Newport Division, in 1841,
contained 2,111 inhabited houses, 61 uninhabited, and five
building.&nbsp; At the same period there were 10,929 inhabitants;
of whom 5,446 were males and 5,483 females.&nbsp; The Wellington
Division at the same period contained 5,959 inhabited houses, 211
uninhabited, and 43 building; and 30,938 inhabitants; of whom
15,856 were males and 15,082 females.&nbsp; The hundred of
Bradford at the Domesday survey was divided into the hundreds of
Odenet and Recordin, and are now distinguished by North and South
Bradford.&nbsp; These names in early times had a certain meaning,
and were given either by reason of the importance or situation of
a place, or in respect of some remarkable circumstance&mdash;as
the name before us, <i>Bradan Forde</i> (that is, Broad Ford), is
said to have its name from a ville named Bradford, situate on the
river Tern, near Ercall, and long since destroyed.</p>
<p><i>The South Division</i> contains the several parishes of
Bolas Magna, Chetwynd, Edgmond, Kinnersley, Lilleshall, Longford,
Newport, Preston-upon-the-Wild-Moors, and Woodcote Chapelry.</p>
<p><i>The Wellington Division</i> contains the parishes of
Atcham, Buildwas, Dawley Magna, Eaton Constantine, Ercall Magna,
Eyton-upon-the-Wild-Moors, Leighton, Longdon-upon-Tern,
Roddington, Stirchley, Uppington, Upton Magna, Upton Parva,
Wellington, Withington, Wombridge, Wrockwardine, and
Wroxeter.</p>
<h3>ATCHAM, <span class="GutSmall">OR</span> ATTINGHAM,</h3>
<p>is a parish in the Wellington Division of the South Bradford
Hundred, comprising 3,491 acres of land, mostly a fertile
undulating district, richly timbered, and watered by the rivers
Severn and the Tern.&nbsp; The soil in some parts is a strong
fertile loam, producing good wheat and barley; in other parts it
is of a lighter nature, and the meadow lands are very
fertile.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;6,126.&nbsp; In 1801 there
were 430 inhabitants; 1831, 463; and in 1841, 95 houses and a
population of 513 souls.&nbsp; The parish comprises the townships
(for highway purposes) of Chilton, Cronkhill, and Emstrey, on the
south-west bank of the Severn, and of Berwick, Atcham, <a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>and
Uckington, on the north-east side of that river.&nbsp; The
village and township of Atcham is delightfully situated in a
salubrious district richly adorned with sylvan beauty, and
contains Attingham Hall, the princely seat of the Right
Honourable Richard Noel Hill (Lord Berwick), and several handsome
villa residences.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Hotel</span> is a
noble pile of buildings, and affords every accommodation to the
numerous visitors who resort here in the summer season to enjoy
the fishing as well as the beautiful views of this interesting
locality.&nbsp; The river Severn is crossed near to the hotel by
a magnificent stone bridge of seven arches, and is about one
hundred and thirty-four yards long.&nbsp; The river Tern has a
bridge across it of beautiful workmanship, which is forty-four
yards across.&nbsp; It is ornamented with an open balustrade of
fine chiselling, upon which is engraved, &ldquo;This bridge was
erected at the expense of the county, in 1780, and decorated at
the expense of Noel Hill, Esq.&rdquo;&nbsp; The great Holyhead
and London turnpike road which intersects the township is in an
admirable state of repair.&nbsp; The village is three miles and
six furlongs south-east from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The Right Hon.
Lord Berwick is lord of the manor and the principal
landowner.&nbsp; Robert Burton, Esq. and others are also
proprietors.&nbsp; A branch of the Shrewsbury, Birmingham,
Chester, and Shropshire Union Canal passes through Atcham parish,
where there is a tunnel of about a mile in length.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St.
Hyatia, and situated in a sequestered spot near the banks of the
Severn, is built of free stone, and consists of nave and chancel,
with a square tower.&nbsp; It was built in 1665, and has recently
undergone a complete reparation.&nbsp; The sittings are of oak,
and the pews of Lord Berwick and those of the Burton family are
elaborately adorned with carved work.&nbsp; The interior has a
very chaste appearance, which is much heightened by the subdued
light admitted through the richly stained glass windows.&nbsp;
The altar is of the most elaborate workmanship.&nbsp; The central
window on the south side is a stained glass memorial of superb
workmanship, in memory of Blanch, daughter of Henry Milnes Parry,
Esq., who held the appointment of &ldquo;chief gentlewoman of
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s privy chamber,&rdquo; whom she served
from the birth of her majesty, and died at court on the 18th of
February, 1589, aged 82.&nbsp; There are also two beautiful
windows of stained glass, embodying the arms of the Burton
family.&nbsp; On an altar tomb, with two full length figures in
memory of deceased members of this family, is a brass plate, on
which is engraven&mdash;&ldquo;This monument was removed from a
pew belonging to the estate of Longnor, in the parish church of
St. Chad, Shrewsbury, on the fall of that church, July, 9th,
1788.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are also several beautiful mural tablets
in memory of the Burtons and others.&nbsp; The living is a
vicarage valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;11. 6s. 8d.,
now returned at &pound;300 in the patronage of Robert Burton,
Esq.&nbsp; Incumbent, Rev. Henry Burton, M.A.&nbsp; The vicarage
is situated near to the church.</p>
<p>The manor, vicarage, and lands in Attingham, otherwise Atcham,
together with other property of great extent, were given to the
monastery of the blessed Virgin Mary, of Lilleshall, by persons
of the name of Blemies, in honour of God and the Virgin
Mary.&nbsp; This was subsequently confirmed by King John.&nbsp;
In the reign of Henry III., the abbot of Lilleshall was
questioned as to his right in taking toll at the bridge of the
Severn of passengers that travelled that way.&nbsp; In the 53rd
of the same reign the abbot had a grant of a fair to be kept at
Attingham on St. Giles&rsquo;s day, and two days after.&nbsp; In
the 4th of Edward I. the said abbot had a grant of another fair
in the month of May, to be held on the feast of St. Augustine,
and the two following days.&nbsp; On the dissolution of religious
houses the manor and tithes of Attingham were granted by the
crown to Thomas Palmer, Knight, but Sir Thomas subsequently
became convicted of treason, and his lordship and estate was
forfeited to the crown, and was soon after granted to Sir John
Gage, Knight.&nbsp; In 1693 it was possessed by the Gowers, and
the lordship is described as containing twenty messuages, three
water mills, twenty gardens, 200 acres of land, forty acres of
meadow, 200 acres of pasture, ten acres of wood, twenty acres of
furze, and the fishery of the Severn.&nbsp; In the 1st year of
Queen Anne, William Gower obtained an act for the <a
name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>sale of the
manor, when it was conveyed to Rowland Hill, Esq., for the sum of
&pound;3,413.&nbsp; His descendant, the Hon. Richard Hill, in
consideration of his affection and regard for his sister,
Margaret Harwood, wife of Thomas Harwood, Esq., conveyed the
manor of Attingham to the use of his sister Margaret for her
life, with remainder to Thomas Harwood, the younger, who
afterwards took the name of Hill, on whose decease this property
descended to his son, Noel Hill, who was created a baron by the
title of Baron Berwick, of Attingham, in the year 1784, on whose
decease it came to his eldest son, Thomas Noel Lord Berwick, who
dying in 1833 without issue the manor and domain of Attingham
descended to his brother, William Noel Hill Lord Berwick, and is
now held by the Right Hon. Richard Noel Hill Lord Berwick, whose
princely seat is <span class="smcap">Attingham Hall</span>, one
of the most extensive and elegant mansions in the county.&nbsp;
It was built from a design by Stewart, and consists of a centre
adorned with a magnificent portico of the composite order,
supported by four circular pillars upwards of forty feet in
height, and two wings connected with the main building by
corridors.&nbsp; The situation of the mansion is peculiarly fine,
and the extensive park by which it is surrounded is beautifully
enriched with wooded scenery; the waters of the majestic Severn
and the river Tern adding much to the picturesque beauty of the
whole.&nbsp; The interior of the mansion is magnificently
furnished, and contains a fine gallery of pictures, chiefly by
the early Italian masters, also a fine collection of Etruscan
vases and other antiquities from Herculaneum.&nbsp; In the
picture gallery is a curious model of Mount Vesuvius, upon a
large scale, made of the materials of the mountain by the late
traveller Dr. Clarke.&nbsp; The park is stocked with deer.&nbsp;
Attingham hall has not been occupied for several years, the
present noble lord having chiefly resided at Cronkhill, on the
opposite side of the Severn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Berwick Mavaston</span> is a lordship
within the parish of Atcham, and was bestowed on Malvesyn,
&ldquo;one of those two hundred and sixty knights famous in the
conqueror&rsquo;s army,&rdquo; who fought in his cause at
Hastings, and by whose means he won the crown of England.&nbsp;
Malvesyn having braved all the dangers, and therefore having a
right to share the spoils of victory, would be eager to fix his
residence on some of the conquered lands.&nbsp; His valour was
rewarded by the grant of the lordship of Rideware, which was
probably held by this Norman knight, under the Earls of
Shrewsbury by the knightly tenure of bearing arms against the
Welsh.&nbsp; He got possession of other lands about the same
period, among which was the lordship of Berwicke Juxta Attingham,
which he held under the same barony, by military service; and as
the leading branch of this family gave their name to the
seigniory of Manvesin Rosny, in France, so we find the younger
branch communicated the same name to the respective lordships of
Manvesin Ridware, and Manvesin Berwick, in England, where this
family flourished in the days of our Henrys and Edwards&mdash;a
knightly race in an age of gallantry; foremost like their Norman
kindred in deeds of arms and works of piety.&nbsp; The situation,
however, not being very distant from the borders of Wales, and
holding the domain by the tenure of border service, his
descendants found it no easy task to defend what their common
ancestor had won by the sword.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry IV.
John Malvesyn being slain at a hunting match, with men of
Shropshire, at the Wrekin, and dying without issue, his niece
Editha carried the Berwick estate into the family of Wydcomb,
from whom it passed in like manner to the Hambrooks, and was
purchased from them by the ancestor of the present proprietor,
Lord Berwick.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chilton</span>, <span

class="smcap">Emstrey</span> are three small townships for
highway purposes, in the parish of Atcham on the western side of
the river Severn, near the Holyhead and Shrewsbury turnpike
road.&nbsp; The land in Chilton is chiefly the property of Robert
Burton, Esq.&nbsp; Cronkhill is the property and seat of the
Right Hon. Richard Noel Hill Lord Berwick, whose principal seat
is Attingham hall.&nbsp; The house at Cronkhill is a plain
stuccoed structure.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Emstrey</span> is
situated about two miles and a half from Shrewsbury, and has

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Joseph
Jones</i>, by will, 1729, directed that six o&rsquo;clock prayers
in St. Alkmund&rsquo;s church, Shrewsbury, should be continued
for ever, for which purpose he gave a yearly rent charge of
&pound;7. 10s., issuing out of his tenement and lands in Astley,
&pound;6 thereof yearly to be paid to the vicar or curate of the
parish of St. Alkmund, or St. Mary, or on their neglect to such
other minister of the church of England as should read prayers in
either of the said churches about the hour of six o&rsquo;clock
in the evening, and 20s. to the clerk, and 10s. to the sexton for
officiating on such occasions; and in case of neglect or refusal,
he gave the said legacy to the poor of the parish of Atcham, to
be applied in the education of poor children, or in the
maintenance of decayed housekeepers; and he further directed that
the payment of 20s. yearly, for the instruction of two poor boys
or girls in the charity school of Shrewsbury, should be continued
for ever, if his wife should think fit.&nbsp; And as to the
residue of the rents of the lands in Astley, he bequeathed the
same to his wife, with liberty for her to sell a parcel of land
called the Wood Meadow; and after her decease, without issue, he
decided that she, by her will or otherwise, should dispose of the
remainder of the rents reserved upon the lease to such charitable
uses as she should think fit; but for want of such appointment
after his wife&rsquo;s decease, he directed that as there was
divine service in the chapel of Astley only every third Sunday in
the month, 10s. monthly should be paid to a minister to read
prayers and preach in the said chapel every first and last Sunday
in the month; but in case of neglect or refusal, he gave the rent
charge to the poor of Atcham and Astley, or for educational
purposes, at the discretion of the trustees.&nbsp; As executor to
Thomas Cox, Mr. Jones had in his hands a legacy of &pound;5,
given for the poor of Atcham, and a sum of &pound;30 entrusted to
him by the Bromley, to buy coals for the poor of Shrawardine; for
securing the payments of 5s. and 30s. as interest of the above,
Mr. Jones charged his lands in Astley and Coleham with the
payment thereof.&nbsp; Elizabeth Jones directed the six
o&rsquo;clock prayers should he continued in the parish of St.
Alkmund as mentioned in her husband&rsquo;s will; and the yearly
sums of &pound;6. 20s., and 10s. paid as by him directed; and she
appointed 40s. to be paid to the said minister to provide candles
during the winter, in case the parish should refuse, and &pound;5
yearly to be paid to the organist of St. Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
estate at Astley contains 58<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 6<span class="smcap">p</span>., and when
the charity commissioners published their report, produced a
yearly rental of &pound;60, out of which &pound;6 is paid to the
minister of Astley, &pound;5 to the organist of St. Mary&rsquo;s,
and &pound;1. 10s. to the poor of Shrawardine.&nbsp; Though the
last-mentioned payment, and the interest of &pound;5 as
Cock&rsquo;s legacy, were charged upon the testators&rsquo;
estates in Shrewsbury and Coleham, as well as that in Astley, the
Shrewsbury and Coleham estates have been sold or passed to
different hands as being exonerated from the charge.&nbsp;
Nothing has been paid for many years for maintaining prayers in
the church of St. Alkmund, or St. Mary&rsquo;s, Shrewsbury, the
duty required not having been performed.&nbsp; The interest of
Cock&rsquo;s legacy is to be considered as included in the
portion of the residue paid to the parish.&nbsp; After the
payment of the several sums above mentioned, and any incidental
expenses that may be incurred, the residue is divided between the
parish of Atcham and the township of Astley, &pound;40 generally
to the former, and &pound;10 to the latter.&nbsp; The Atcham
portion is disposed of with the produce of other charities, in
money or clothing, on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, chiefly among such
of the poor as do not receive parochial relief.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Burton</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, of Longnor, in 1730,
bequeathed &pound;10 per annum for the use of the poorest
inhabitants of this parish, and charged an estate in Berwick with
the payment of the same.&nbsp; The amount is given away with the
produce of Jones&rsquo;s charity.</p>
<p><i>The Countess of Harborough</i>, in 1765, left to the poor
of this parish the sum of &pound;200, the interest to be annually
distributed by the patron and minister of Atcham.&nbsp; This sum
was laid out, in the year 1792, in the purchase of &pound;193.
11s. 6d. stock, four per cent. <a name="page368"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 368</span>annuities, and in the year 1803 the
sum of &pound;44. 2s. 10d., which was raised by suffering the
dividends to accumulate, was laid out in the purchase of
additional stock to make up the sum of &pound;250.&nbsp; The
dividends, amounting to &pound;8. 15. per annum, together with
&pound;1. 5s. added by the vicar to make up the deficiency
occasioned by the reduction of the dividends, is also disposed of
with the produce of Jones&rsquo;s charity.</p>
<p><i>Margaret Thompson</i>, in 1751, gave &pound;6, the yearly
interest to purchase bibles and prayer books for poor
children.&nbsp; This sum is in the hands of the vicar, and he
applies the interest according to the donor&rsquo;s
intentions.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Hill</i>, in 1779, bequeathed &pound;100 to the
vicar, churchwardens, and overseers of Atcham, on trust, to apply
the interest in relieving the necessities of the poor not
receiving parochial relief.&nbsp; This gift is in the hands of
Lord Berwick, who distributes annually a quantity of meat and
provisions, exceeding the amount of the interest.</p>
<p>In 1666 <i>John Cox</i> left &pound;20 to the poor of the
parish.&nbsp; <i>Joan Blakeway</i>, in 1684, left a yearly sum of
6s. to be distributed among the poor.&nbsp; <i>John Calcott</i>,
in 1698, charged a tenement in Worthen with the payment of 12s.
and 7s. a year, to be distributed among poor housekeepers of
Atcham.&nbsp; He also charged the same premises with the legacy
of Joan Blakeley, of 6s. yearly.&nbsp; It is supposed that
something was paid in respect of these charities by Scarlet
Lloyd, Esq., who died about fifty years ago.&nbsp; Nothing,
however, has been paid since that period; and though some pains
have been taken to discover the tenement in Worthen subject to
the payment of the charities, no satisfactory information has
been obtained.</p>
<p><i>Richard Cox</i> gave &pound;5, and directed the interest to
be expended in bread and given to the poor on Easter day.&nbsp;
The sum of 5s. was paid in respect of this charity for several
years, by Robert Burton, Esq., of Longnor, supposing it to be
charged on property taken by him from one of the Calcott family,
in exchange for other lands.&nbsp; On examining the title deeds
at a subsequent period, no such charge is mentioned, and he
therefore declined paying in any longer.</p>
<p><i>Dorothy Whitcome</i> left &pound;10 for the benefit of the
poor.&nbsp; In 1742, this gift, by some means which we are unable
to account for, was reduced to &pound;4. 7s. 8&frac12;d., and at
a parish meeting held in that year, it was agreed to distribute
the principal among the poor.</p>

<h3>BOLAS MAGNA, <span class="GutSmall">OR</span> GREAT
BOLAS,</h3>
<p>is a parish and small rural village, in a retired part of the
country, seven miles W. by N. from Wellington.&nbsp; The houses
are in general scattered, but pleasantly situated on the banks of
the river Tern, <a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>which divides this parish from Little Bolas.&nbsp; The
parish contains 1,784 acres of land; mostly a bold undulating
district, the soil of which is a mixture of sand and loam.&nbsp;
The meadow lands are highly fertile.&nbsp; In 1801, there were
207 inhabitants; 1831, 255; and in 1841, 55 houses and a
population of 228 souls.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;2,682.&nbsp; The principal landowners are John Taylor,
Esq., Thomas Taylor, Esq., Joseph Ogle, Esq., and Mrs. Pooler,
besides whom there are several smaller proprietors.&nbsp; The
Newport, Preston Brockhurst, and Wellington turnpike roads cross
the township.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>,
dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is a brick structure, except
the chancel which is of stone, situated on a gentle eminence near
the banks of the river Tern.&nbsp; It has a square tower, which
contains two bells.&nbsp; The interior has a neat appearance; it
is pewed with oak sittings, and has a small gallery.&nbsp; In the
chancel is a neat tablet in memory of John Ogle, Esq., and his
wife, dated 1840.&nbsp; Another mural tablet remembers Thomas
Griffith, and several members of that family, and is dated
1745.&nbsp; The living is a rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;7. 9s. 4&frac12;d.&nbsp; Gross income, &pound;368.
14s, in the patronage of Viscount Hill, incumbent, Rev. John
Hill, M.A., who resides at <span class="smcap">The
Rectory</span>, a pleasantly situated house, on elevated ground,
near the banks of the river Tern.&nbsp; The rectory was built a
few years ago by the present incumbent, in aid of which a grant
was obtained from the governors of Queen Anne&rsquo;s
Bounty.&nbsp; There are 46 acres of glebe land.&nbsp; A small
organ was purchased for the church in 1843; the cost of it,
&pound;63, was raised by subscriptions, chiefly given by the
family of Hill.&nbsp; There is a <span
class="smcap">School</span> in the village, where 20 children are
educated free; other children are admitted on the payment of a
small sum weekly.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Bolas House</span>,
the residence of John Taylor, Esq., is a spacious brick
structure, surrounded with neat pleasure grounds and park-like
enclosures.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Burleigh Villa</span>, a
good house, with projecting gables, is approached by an avenue of
trees, and delightfully situated, is the property and residence
of Thomas Taylor, Esq.&nbsp; Bolas is celebrated as the place
where the late Marquis of Exeter domiciled for a time under the
assumed name of Mr. Jones, courted, and married Miss Sarah
Hoggins, and finally raised her to the rank of a British
peeress.&nbsp; At the time Mr. Cecil visited Great Bolas, Mr.
Hoggins had a farm and kept a small shop.&nbsp; One evening, just
as the day had closed, a stranger presented himself at the door,
and stated that he was benighted in a strange part of the
country, and would be grateful for the accommodation of a bed,
or, in case that would be inconvenient, to rest on a chair or
otherwise.&nbsp; Mrs. Hoggins, however, very abruptly gave a
refusal, but Mr. Hoggins expressed it as his opinion that it was
their christian duty to befriend the stranger; to which Mrs.
Hoggins eventually assented.&nbsp; In the morning, the stranger
arose, and went to survey the farm premises and stock; but the
principal object that attracted his attention was the
farmer&rsquo;s daughter, Sarah, feeding the poultry.&nbsp; She
was a handsome girl, with a lively and cheerful countenance,
bespeaking sensibility and happiness.&nbsp; The heart of the
stranger was no longer his own, but he determined not to be too
premature, and therefore made an agreement to become an inmate of
the farmer&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; He employed his leisure hours
in assisting Mr. Hoggins in the rural affairs of his farm, and in
domestic matters as occasion occurred, frequently visiting
Wellington in the market cart.&nbsp; Mr. Jones eventually began
to manifest a degree of partiality for Miss Hoggins, and placed
her at a school at Wellington.&nbsp; This circumstance did not
escape the notice of the neighbours, and the mysterious stranger
was the talk of the surrounding district.&nbsp; Most people could
discover that he was no ordinary person, and various were the
suppositions as to his real character; but generally the idea
prevailed among the gossips of the neighbourhood that he was
captain of a gang of robbers, and this opinion was strengthened
by the occasional visit of strangers and the absence of Mr. Jones
every now and then for a few days, after which he had always
plenty of money.&nbsp; He finally made proposals of marriage to
Miss Hoggins, whose heart had from the first felt a kindred
flame, and he was accordingly accepted.&nbsp; He then pressed his
suit with the parents, but the cautious mother sternly refused,
and thought there might be some truth in the <a
name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>supposition
of her neighbours as to the real character of her guest; but the
father had observed their mutual attachment, and the
conclusiveness of his reasoning, &ldquo;Has he not plenty of
money to keep her?&rdquo; eventually prevailed with the good old
dame.&nbsp; After his marriage with Sarah, he engaged masters in
every branch of polite education to accomplish his bride.&nbsp;
In the course of time the lovely bride had a daughter, which
died, and was buried at Bolas.&nbsp; Her second child, Brownlow,
became the Marquis of Exeter.&nbsp; On the demise of his uncle,
in December, 1793, he became entitled to the honours and estates
of the Earldom of Exeter; he, therefore, found it necessary to
repair to London.&nbsp; He accordingly set out, as on a journey
of pleasure, taking his wife with him, and on the route called at
several noblemen&rsquo;s houses, where, to the astonishment of
his wife, he was welcomed in the most friendly manner.&nbsp; At
length they arrived at the beautiful patrimonial seat of his
lordship (Burleigh, in Northamptonshire), and on approaching the
house he asked his wife, with an air of unconcern, whether she
would like it to be her home; which she immediately assenting to,
he then said, &ldquo;My dear Sarah, it is yours!&rdquo; and on
making his appearance in front of the house, he was instantly
recognised, and received with acclamations of joy by the family
and domestics.</p>
<p>His lordship shortly afterwards returned to Bolas, discovered
his rank to his wife&rsquo;s father and mother, put them in a
house he had built there, and settled on them an income of
&pound;700 per annum.&nbsp; He also amply provided for the
brothers and sisters of his countess; and generously pensioned
all the servants and workpeople of the villa.&nbsp; The countess,
from her pleasing and unassuming manners, was received with the
greatest cordiality in the high circle of her noble husband, and
was introduced to her majesty, the late Queen Charlotte.&nbsp;
She, however, lived but a short period to enjoy her exalted
station, dying in child-bed January 8th, 1797.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Messon</span> is a small township, in

<h3>BUILDWAS</h3>
<p>is a parish township and small rural village delightfully
situated near the banks of the Severn, four and a half miles N.E.
from Much Wenlock.&nbsp; The parish contains 2,152 acres of land,
of which 350 acres are in woods and plantations, the remainder is
about equally divided in arable and pasture or meadow lands; the
soil is mostly heavy, and produces good wheat and barley.&nbsp;
In 1801 there was a population of 258 souls; 1831, 240, and in
1841 there were 59 houses and 273 inhabitants.&nbsp; A beautiful
iron bridge of one arch 130 feet span was erected by the
Coalbrook-dale Company over the Severn at this place in 1796, at
an expense of &pound;6,034.&nbsp; The rise of the bridge is 24 <a
name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 371</span>feet, and
as the road-way could not be carried to a greater height,
advantage was taken of the Schaffhausen principal by making the
ribs rise to the top of the railings, and connecting them to the
lower ribs by means of dove-tailed king posts.&nbsp; The old
bridge, which had narrow arches that impeded the navigation of
the river, was carried away by a flood in 1795.&nbsp; Walter
Moseley, Esq., (a minor), is landowner, lord of the manor, and
impropriator of the tithes, which are commuted for
&pound;350.&nbsp; The incumbent of the parish has a payment of
&pound;16. 2s. 6d. issuing out of certain lands contiguous to the
abbey.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a small
structure of free stone, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and
consists of nave and chancel, with a wooden turret; it was
rebuilt in 1720.&nbsp; It contains several neat marble tablets,
one of which on the north wall remembers Margaret Smitheman, who
died 1818; another on the south side remembers John Smitheman,
and is dated 1809; Humphrey Wheeler and his four sons are also
remembered on a neat mural tablet dated 1739, besides which there
are several others.&nbsp; The living is a donative in the
patronage of W. Moseley, Esq.&nbsp; Incumbent, Rev. John
Bartlett, M.A., who resides at Marn Wood, a pleasantly situated
residence just within the bounds of Madeley parish.&nbsp; The
poor of this parish enjoy the benefit of a rent charge of
&pound;5 per annum, the benefaction of Miss Ann Lacon.&nbsp; The
annuity is received by the churchwardens, who distribute in equal
moieties at Michaelmas and Lady-day among four poor widows in
shares of 12s. 6d. each.&nbsp; Near to the bridge there is a
respectable inn, conducted by Mr. William Jones.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Buildwas Abbey</span>.&mdash;The
magnificent ruins of Buildwas abbey are situated in a picturesque
vale, near the banks of the river Severn, whose silvery waters
are here crossed by a noble cast iron bridge, having a span of
130 feet.&nbsp; The massive walls of the abbey, with the grey
pillars and arches, present a fine contrast to the rich verdure
which surrounds them, and being environed with high grounds
crowned with timber, it presents one of the most lovely spots for
conventual retirement that can well be imagined.&nbsp; The outer
walls of the abbey church are almost entire.&nbsp; The structure
was cruciform with a massive tower in the middle, which rested on
four pointed arches.&nbsp; On each side of the nave are seven
pillars, with indented capitals, from whence spring arches with
obtuse points.&nbsp; Above is a clerestory with small round
headed windows.&nbsp; The side aisles, the transept, and the
chapel of the choir are entirely in ruins.&nbsp; Under the north
wing of the transept is the crypt, the whole of which has
evidently been groined with stone, and was supported by circular
and diagonal pillars.&nbsp; Over the chapter house and other
apartments forming the east side of the cloister are the remains
of a second story, which was probably the dormitory.&nbsp; A
little eastward of the cloister are probably the remains of the
refectory.&nbsp; The view of this venerable structure from the
west end is peculiarly striking: the huge pillars with their bold
arches and projecting capitals, the lofty arches which supported
the tower, and the windows of the gloomy choir, contrasted with
the rich verdure, and the luxuriant ivy mantling the walls,
altogether form a solemn spectacle of fallen grandeur.&nbsp; The
abbey was founded by Roger de Clinton, in 1135, for monks of the
order of Savigny, who were afterwards united to the
Cistercians.&nbsp; The house was dedicated to St. Mary and St.
Chad, and the foundation was confirmed by King Stephen, in the
year 1139.&nbsp; Leland in his itinerary says, &ldquo;Matilda de
Bohun, wife of Sir Robert Burnell, was founder of Buildwas
abbey,&rdquo; but among the charters of the monasticon there is
no mention of this Matilda, and the foundation is in two or three
places ascribed to Roger de Clinton, Bishop of Chester.&nbsp;
Rustandus, the pope&rsquo;s legate, with the assistance of the
bishop of Hereford, extorted large sums of money from the clergy;
the legate summoned the abbots of the Cistercian order to meet at
Reading, when he demanded supplies for the use of the pope and
the king, which amounted to the value of their wool.&nbsp; The
abbots made answer that the tax was very grievous, and therefore
could come to no resolution without the consent of their
convents.&nbsp; Rustandus incensed at that answer acquainted the
king that the Cistercians refused to grant him supplies.&nbsp;
The king swore that those who refused to submit to his demands
should feel the effects of his power.&nbsp; There was then at
court the abbot of Buildwas, whom the king <a
name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 372</span>reprimanded
after this manner, &ldquo;What is the meaning, abbot, that you
refuse to supply my necessities; am I not your
patron?&rdquo;&nbsp; To whom the abbot replied, &ldquo;I would to
God, sir, you were our patron, our father, and defender; but it
does not become your majesty to extort money from those who can
only assist you with their prayers; let the exemplary piety of
the king of France be a precedent to your majesty in this
respect.&rdquo;&nbsp; The king replied, &ldquo;I demand both your
money and your prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How is that
consistent,&rdquo; said the abbot, &ldquo;for one of them you
must be without.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the suppression here were twelve
monks who, according to Dugdale, were endowed with &pound;110.
19s. 3d. per annum, but Speed estimates the value at &pound;129.
6s. 10d.&nbsp; The site, with all the land in Shropshire,
Staffordshire, and Derbyshire, were granted to Edward Lord Powis
in the 29th of Henry VIII.</p>
<p>An extraordinary phenomena occurred on the 27th of May, 1775,
at a place called the Birches, situated between Buildwas and
Ironbridge, which will be found noticed with the latter
place.</p>

<h3>CHETWYND</h3>
<p>is a parish which includes the townships of Chetwynd and
Howle, part of Pickstock and part of Sambrook; the latter will be
found noticed in Cheswardine parish, and Pickstock is given with
Edgmond in which parish it is chiefly situated.&nbsp; The hamlet
of Pixley noticed with Hinstock contains 89<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 28<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land in this parish.&nbsp; The parish
of Chetwynd contains 3,803<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 30<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
and in 1801 had 594 inhabitants, 1831, 766, and in 1841,
760.&nbsp; The village of Chetwynd forms the northern suburb to
the town of Newport, on the line of road leading from that town
to Market Drayton, but the church, the hall, and the rectory are
situated on the same line of road nearly two miles north from
Newport.&nbsp; The township contains 1,727<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 5<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and in 1841 had 109 houses and
543 inhabitants.&nbsp; John Charles Burton Borough, Esq., is the
principal land owner and lord of the manor; Robert Fisher, Esq.,
Thomas Collier, Esq., the Rev. William Dalton, are also land
owners.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Church</span>, a plain
brick structure dedicated to St. Michael, has been built about
one hundred years; it consists of nave and bay, and has a square
tower in which are six bells; there is a gallery at the west end
built in the year 1841 by voluntary subscriptions.&nbsp; The
living is a rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;10.
16s. 3d., now returned at &pound;775. in the patronage of J. C.
B. Borough, Esq.; incumbent, Rev. Rev. Thomas Whateley, M.A., who
resides at the rectory, a good residence near the church.&nbsp;
The tithes are commuted for &pound;742. 4s. 11&frac12;d.&nbsp;
The <span class="smcap">Hall</span> is an ancient structure near
the east end of the church, which appears to have been built at
different periods; in the low grounds in front of the hall, the
river Meese, an inconsiderable stream takes its course.&nbsp; The
park comprises about 300 acres of land, and is situated on the
west side of the turnpike road leading from Newport to Market
Drayton; it has a bold undulating surface, well timbered and
stocked with about two hundred head of deer; a fine sheet of
water covers about thirty acres.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">National School</span> is situated about midway
between Newport and Chetwynd church; there is a residence for the
teacher, and the number of scholars that attend average about
seventy.</p>
<p><a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span><span
class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;In 1717 a house and croft
situated in High street, Newport, was conveyed in trust for the
benefit of the poor of Chetwynd, in consideration of &pound;80
paid to James and Thomas Liversage, whereof &pound;50 was money
given by Honor Dryden and others for charitable uses.&nbsp; This
house has been unfortunately long lost to the charity, and there
is no evidence to show that the poorhouse ever derived any
benefit from it.&nbsp; Of the croft in Chetwynd a small part,
about a rood, was taken upwards of fifty years ago for the site
of a house of industry, for which no compensation had been made
when the charity commissioners published their report.&nbsp; The
remainder of the land produces about &pound;3 per annum.</p>
<p>There is a piece of land containing about three acres known by
the name of Lady meadow, the rent of which was received by the
parish officers as early as the year 1625, but there is no trace
of the source from which the land was derived.&nbsp; The sum of
&pound;1 0s. 4d. was the rent paid from the above year down to
1820, although the premises were then worth about &pound;8 per
annum.&nbsp; There are certain premises in the parish of Edgmond
now consisting of three cottages with gardens and about nine
acres of land, which were purchased in 1728 with certain
benefactions left by Ann Pigott and Robert Pigott for the benefit
of the poor of Chetwynd; the rents from these premises amount to
&pound;28 per annum.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe from entries in the parish books,
that the land at Hinstock consisting of about ten acres, was
purchased for the use of the poor of Chetwynd about the beginning
of the 18th century, but there is no evidence to show what was
the amount of purchase money, or from what particular source it
was derived.&nbsp; It first appears in the parish books in the
year 1700 at a rent of &pound;2. 10s., which continued without
increase until 1760.&nbsp; In 1783 it was let for &pound;4. 15s.
and the amount has since been raised to &pound;14. 14s.</p>
<p><i>William Unite&rsquo;s</i> charity of five penny loaves
weekly, and several sums of money amounting to &pound;30 left by
several benefactors, have been applied to the use of the parish,
and the parish officers now pay &pound;2. 11s. 8d. as the
interest thereof.</p>
<p>The gross income of the several charities above mentioned
amounts to &pound;49. 6s. per annum, and at the time the charity
commissioners visited Chetwynd, was expended in the following
manner: &pound;1. 14s. applied in aid of the church rates,
&pound;5. 6s. 8d. in distributions of bread, &pound;4 in the
purchase of coal, and &pound;38. 10s. was carried to the
poor&rsquo;s rates.&nbsp; The latter, we conceive, is an
objectionable mode of applying money left for charitable uses,
and totally at variance with the donors&rsquo; intentions.&nbsp;
It was intended, however, by the parishioners, to have a fresh
application of the charitable funds, and to apply a portion
towards the support of a school.</p>
<p><i>Robert Pigott</i>, who died in 1746, left the sum of
&pound;50, the interest to be distributed among poor
housekeepers.&nbsp; Certain benefactions, recorded on tables in
the church, left by twelve several donors, amounting to
&pound;68, in the absence of any account of their disposal, may
be presumed to have formed the purchase money of the lands, of
which there are no documents to trace their origin.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Chetwynd End are entitled to participate in
the benefits of the Grammar School and other charities at
Newport.</p>

<h4>DAWLEY MAGNA,</h4>
<p>a populous parish busily engaged in the extensive iron works
and collieries with which the vicinity abounds, is situated four
miles S.E. from Wellington.&nbsp; The parish comprises the
townships of Dawley Magna, Dawley Parva, and Malinslee.&nbsp; In
1801 there was a population of 3,869 souls; 1831, 6,877, and in
1841 there were 1,716 houses and 8,641 inhabitants, of whom 4,490
were males, and 4,151 females.&nbsp; The township of Dawley Magna
contains 997<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 21<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
and in 1841 had 904 houses and 4,485 inhabitants.&nbsp; R. A.
Slaney, Esq., is lord of the manor and a considerable landowner;
Beriah Botfield, Esq., the Coalbrook Dale Company, Robert Burton,
Esq., and the Langley Field Company, are also proprietors.&nbsp;
The collieries vary from 150 yards to 200 yards in depth, and the
seams of coal from two feet to four feet in thickness; the coal
is of a very superior quality, and got in immense
quantities.&nbsp; The Coalbrook Dale Company give employment to
upwards of 3,500 hands, and the quantity of coal raised by this
firm in the parish of Dawley alone amounts to 8,500 tons per
month, or 102,000 tons per annum, of ironstone 42,000 tons a
year.&nbsp; The same company also make 17,880 tons of pig iron,
at the Horse Hay Works in this parish, besides 14,200 tons of
finished merchant iron yearly.&nbsp; A very ingenious contrivance
is adopted at the Horse Hay Works, by means of which 100 tons of
coal per month are saved.&nbsp; Attached to the furnace chimnies
where the iron is made are pipes by which the gas is brought down
under the immense steam engines which are necessary for raising
the coal and ironstone from the mines contiguous to the
works.&nbsp; On the gas uniting with the atmospheric air under
the engines it immediately ignites, and thus an immense saving
and power is acquired which is generally neglected in other
establishments.&nbsp; At the time we saw the works there was a
surplus supply of gas thrown off, which would have put in motion
an engine of 100 horse power.&nbsp; The Horse Hay Works took
their name from the circumstance of this place, in former days
being the depository for hay, when the minerals were carried on
pack horses from Ketley-bank to Coalbrook dale&mdash;this was a
half-way house where the horses were fed, and hence the name
Horse Hay Works.&nbsp; Each of the adult workmen employed at this
extensive establishment pays 1s. per month, which forms a fund
for educational purposes and funeral expenses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to the Holy
Trinity, is a handsome structure of free stone, erected in 1845,
at a cost of about &pound;3,000, raised by subscriptions and
grants from the church building societies.&nbsp; The stone was
got from a neighbouring quarry.&nbsp; It consists of <a
name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 375</span>nave,
chancel and side aisles, with a tower at the west end, in which
are six bells.&nbsp; The interior has a chaste appearance: the
nave is separated from the side aisles by four lofty arches; on
the north side of the chancel is a neat stone pulpit, and there
is a gallery at the west end, upon which there is a superior
organ erected in 1851 at a cost of &pound;200.&nbsp; The pews are
uniform in character, and there are 831 sittings, of which 664
are free and unappropriated.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual
curacy in the patronage of the Messrs. Phillips.&nbsp; Incumbent,
Rev. William Richards, M.A.&nbsp; The parsonage is about half a
mile N.W. from the church.&nbsp; The rectoral tithes are commuted
for &pound;82. 10s.&nbsp; Messrs. Phillips are the
impropriators.&nbsp; The incumbent receives &pound;1.&nbsp; The
parish register dates from the year 1666.&nbsp; The old church
stood a little S.E. of the present edifice; it was a small
structure of primitive simplicity, and had a short tower at the
west end.&nbsp; On the east side of the church yard stands the
old parsonage, an antique fabric of wood and plaster with a
thatched roof; it is much dilapidated by time, and is expected
shortly to be taken down.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Wesleyan
Chapel</span>, Dawley Green, is a plain octagonal structure,
which will hold about 400 hearers.&nbsp; The Wesleyans have also

spacious structure capable of holding about 1,000 persons,
situated in Dawley Green-lane.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Dawley
Green</span> is a most densely populated part of the parish, and
is about half a mile from the church; in High street are many
good houses and shops in all the different branches of the retail
trade.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Pool Hill School</span> is a
noble pile of buildings, erected at a cost of upwards of
&pound;3,500, defrayed by the munificence of different members of
the Darby family.&nbsp; The interior is spacious and lofty, and
the roof is of groined timber stained in imitation of oak.&nbsp;
There is a good library containing upwards of 400 volumes.&nbsp;
The school has been built for the education of the children of
workmen belonging to the Coalbrook Dale Company, and is partly
supported from a fund into which each workman pays 1s. per month
for educational purposes and funeral expenses of deceased
members; the residue necessary for the support of the school is
paid by the Coalbrook Dale Company.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">National School</span> is a plain structure,
erected in 1841, and situated near the parsonage house.&nbsp;
About 100 children attend.&nbsp; It is supported by subscriptions
and the pence of the children.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Finger
Lane</span> is a scattered district to the east of the

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Richard
Hodden</i>, by will, dated 19th June, 1684, devised his land of
inheritance, situated in Dogpole-street, Shrewsbury, and also his
lands lying in Middleton-on-the-Hill, in the county of Hereford,
to Richard Hodden and his heirs, on condition that he should
(among other things) pay an annuity of &pound;7 to the poor of
Dawley Magna.&nbsp; The premises in Dogpole-street, Shrewsbury,
mentioned in Hodden&rsquo;s will, cannot now be identified, but
the annuity is paid by Mr. Bird, the occupier, and part owner of
the premises of Middleton, which consists of a farm and
buildings, and about seventy acres of land.&nbsp; The amount is
divided among poor widows, who are relieved according to their
necessities.</p>
<p><i>Rebecca Walthall</i>, who died in 1756, bequeathed to the
churchwardens of Dawley &pound;40, and directed the interest to
be distributed yearly to the poor of Malinslee.&nbsp; This money
was in the hands of the late William Botfield, Esq., who
distributed 40s. as the interest thereof among poor widows.&nbsp;
When the charity commissioners published their report Mr.
Botfield had also a further sum of &pound;50 in his hands, left
as he believed by Rebecca Walthall, for which he paid interest to
the incumbent of Dawley.</p>
<p>In the year 1738, by deed, dated 14th of April, Richard
Styche, in consideration of &pound;20 paid to him by Edward
Forsbrook, with the consent of the parishioners, for placing the
said money at interest for the benefit of the poor of the parish,
assigned a cottage at Madeley Wood, which had been granted to him
in 1732, by George Yorke, for securing the repayment of &pound;30
advanced by him to Yorke, and of which &pound;10 had been since
paid off.&nbsp; And by a memorandum at the back of the deed the
parties agreed that interest at four per cent. should be paid for
the &pound;20.&nbsp; On the 7th March, 1857, the said George
Yorke, by endorsement on this deed, acknowledged to have borrowed
of the parish officers of Dawley the sum of &pound;13, which sum,
with interest at the rate of 10s. a year, he agreed should be
payable from the said premises, making the whole principal sum
&pound;33.&nbsp; We could not ascertain with certainty the origin
of this poor&rsquo;s money, but find that Enoch Cooper, in 1721,
left a sum of &pound;20 to the use of the poor of Great Dawley,
and this sum probably formed the first amount advanced on this
mortgage.&nbsp; In the returns of the commissioners under the act
of the 26th of George III., there is mention of a benefaction by
another person of the name of Cooper of &pound;13, which agrees
with the further sum advanced on the mortgage in 1757, but we
have not found any other trace of this donation.</p>

<h4>EATON CONSTANTINE,</h4>
<p>is a parish and delightfully situated village, near the Wrekin
Hill, seven miles S.E. from Shrewsbury, and five miles S.W. from
Wellington.&nbsp; The parish comprises 874<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 10<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, the principal owners of which
are the Duke of Cleveland and Mrs. Maun, besides whom Mrs.
Langley, Mr. Samuel Dalloe, Mr. George Davies, and Mr. William
Langley, are also proprietors.&nbsp; The Duke of Cleveland is
lord of the manor.&nbsp; In 1801 Eaton parish contained 204
inhabitants; 1831, 244, and in 1841 59 houses and 294
souls.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>, a neat stone
edifice dedicated to St. Mary, exhibits the gothic style of
architecture, and was almost wholly rebuilt during the years
1847&ndash;8, at a cost of &pound;775.&nbsp; Of this sum
&pound;490 was raised by subscriptions, &pound;125 was granted by
the Diocesan Society, &pound;60 by the Incorporated Society for
Enlarging and Building Churches, and &pound;100 was raised by a
parish rate on the parishioners.&nbsp; It is considered a free
chapel or rectory, in the patronage of the Duke of Cleveland;
incumbent, Rev. Henry Beckwith.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for
&pound;176, of <a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
379</span>which &pound;46 is paid to the vicar of Leighton, and
the residue is paid to the incumbent of Eaton Constantine.&nbsp;
There are 25 acres of glebe land.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
National School</span> is a modern structure erected at the cost
of &pound;190, and situated near the church.&nbsp; The Privy
Council on Education granted &pound;40 towards the erection, the
Diocesan Society &pound;20, the National Society &pound;15, and
the residue was raised by public subscriptions.&nbsp; The average
attendance of children is about sixty.</p>
<p>There is belonging to the poor of this parish the sum of
&pound;20, the origin of which is not known.&nbsp; It is secured
on the Atcham House of Industry, and the interest, amounting to
18s. per annum, is distributed among four of the poorest
parishioners.&nbsp; William Warham, in 1806, bequeathed after the
decease of his wife the interest of &pound;100, and directed the
same to be distributed among five of the poorest parishioners of
the parish.&nbsp; The testator&rsquo;s widow died in 1826, and
&pound;90 (&pound;10 having been deducted for the legacy duty),
was laid out in the purchase of &pound;114. 2s. 1d. three per
cent. consols.&nbsp; The dividends, amounting to &pound;3. 8s.
4d. per annum, are divided on Candlemas-day among five poor men
residing in the parish.</p>

<h4>EDGMOND</h4>
<p>is a considerable parish, comprising the townships of Adeney,
Butterey, Calvington, Caynton, Cherrington, Chetwynd Aston,
Church Aston, Stanford, Tibberton, and part of Pickstock.&nbsp;
The parish contains 5,026<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 31<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land;
gross estimated rental, &pound;9,227. 16s. 1&frac12;d.; rateable
value, &pound;7,854. 8s. 11&frac12;d.&nbsp; Population in 1801,
1,699; 1831, 2,300, and in 1841, 2,471.&nbsp; The village of
Edgmond is pleasantly situated on elevated ground, about a mile
W. from Newport; it contains several good residences, and
commands some pleasing prospects of the surrounding
country.&nbsp; The township contains 1,933<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 27<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and in 1841 there were 174
houses and 792 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;3,741.
4s.&nbsp; 9&frac14;d.&nbsp; The lands are intersected by the
Shropshire union canal, which covers 20<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 32<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land.&nbsp; The principal landowners
are Thomas Bayley, Esq., Mr. John Cooke Hill, Rev. John D.
Pigott, Rev. William Dalton, Mr. John Moore, Mr. John Alcock, Mr.
Thomas Harper Adams, and Mrs. Dewson; J. C. H. Borough, Esq., is
lord of the manor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a fine old
castellated structure, dedicated to St. Peter, consisting of
nave, chancel, and side aisles, with a square tower in which are
six bells; four pointed arches rising from octagonal pillars
divide the nave from the side aisles.&nbsp; The chancel is
spacious and covered with tesselated pavement.&nbsp; Above the
altar is a beautiful stained glass window, added a few years ago
at the expense of the present rector; it contains figures,
chastely executed, representative of St. Peter, St. James, and
St. John, the other compartments being richly ornamented with
gothic tracery.&nbsp; The west window has also been beautified
with stained glass by the liberality of the parishioners.&nbsp;
In the centre aisle is a brass with two full length figures, the
armorial bearings of the family, and figures of thirteen
children, in memory of the Young&rsquo;s, a family of consequence
in this locality in former days.&nbsp; A neat tablet in the south
aisle remembers William Briscoe, Esq., of Caynton, who died in
1828; near to it is another tablet to the memory of John Bayley,
Esq., who died in 1833.&nbsp; The font has been re-hewn, but the
original characters have been preserved.&nbsp; An alabaster slab,
recently removed from the chancel to the west end of the church,
remembers Nicholas Peckell, supposed to have been the last Roman
Catholic rector of this place.&nbsp; The church was anciently
appropriated to the abbey of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In the 10th of
Henry VII., the advowson was given to the Carthusian priory at
Shortly, near Coventry.&nbsp; The patronage is now vested in the
Rev. John Dryden <a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>Pigott, B.A., who is also the incumbent.&nbsp; The
tithes have been commuted for &pound;2,400, and there are 62<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 25<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of glebe land.&nbsp; The rectory is a
very ancient building on the south side of the church yard; it
was no doubt built for the reception of some of the religious
orders in Catholic times.&nbsp; A low doorway and some other
small fragments are all that remain of the ancient fabric.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Edgmond Hall</span>, a handsome brick
residence pleasantly situated a little south from the church, is
the property of Mr. John C. Hill, but unoccupied when our agent
visited Edgmond.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The National
School</span>, situated a little west from the church, has an
attendance of 54 boys and 46 girls.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Primitive Methodists</span> have a small chapel built in
1835.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;In 1699 certain
lands were purchased with the sum of &pound;70, which is supposed
to have been derived from some of the numerous benefactions which
are recorded on a tablet in the church, and for the greater
number of which, amounting to &pound;211, no permanent mode of
application is there designed.&nbsp; In the purchase deeds it is
directed that six penny loaves should be distributed in the
parish every Sunday, from which it is inferred that John
Moreton&rsquo;s gift of &pound;26 formed part of the purchase
money, the interest of which at five per cent. would exactly
suffice for the weekly distribution of six penny loaves.&nbsp;
These lands, with an allotment of about three-fourths of an acre
made in respect of them some years ago, contain in the whole
13<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>.
22<span class="smcap">p</span>., and now produces a yearly rental
of &pound;12.&nbsp; There are also about twelve acres of land
situate in the parish of Edgmond, and belonging to the poor of
the parish, which are supposed to have been purchased with other
of the benefactions recorded upon the tablet in the church, but
there are no deeds or documents now extant indicating the source
from which the property was derived, or the trusts on which it is
held.&nbsp; There are four pieces of land which together are let
for &pound;26. 12s. per annum; from this fund, and &pound;4. 10s.
added from the rents of the Hinstock estate, 7s. worth of bread
is distributed every week among the poor of Edgmond, and 14s.
worth is sent every Easter to Tibberton. &pound;1. 19s. is
distributed among the poor of Edgmond on St. David&rsquo;s-day in
sums of 6d. each, as the gift of David Oliver.&nbsp; The residue
of the fund amounting to &pound;10. 5s. is expended in warm
clothing for the poor during the winter season.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Dryden Pigott</i>, in 1734, bequeathed &pound;200,
and directed the interest thereof to be employed in clothing and
schooling, and for books for such poor boys inhabiting the
village of Edgmond as his executor and the rector of Edgmond,
their heirs and successors, should judge to be a sufficient
number for the purpose; the said boys to be clothed and kept at
school so long as the said trustees should think fit.&nbsp; This
legacy in 1806 was invested in the purchase of &pound;258. 8s.
3d. four per cent. stock, and the dividends, which amount to
&pound;10. 4s. 8d., are employed in the clothing and education of
seven or eight boys.</p>
<p><i>John Smith</i> left &pound;100, the interest to be given
upon St. John&rsquo;s-day to the poor of Edgmond.&nbsp; <i>Robert
Pigott</i>, in 1746, left &pound;50, the interest to be given to
the poor of Edgmond and Adeney.&nbsp; An annual sum of &pound;7.
10s. is paid by the Rev. John D. Pigott as the interest of these
two benefactions.&nbsp; The amount is given away in half-crowns
to the poor of Adeney and Edgmond on St. John&rsquo;s-day.</p>

Chapel</span> is a neat brick structure, consisting of nave, <a
name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>bay, and
transepts, with an octagonal tower surmounted by a vane.&nbsp;
The chapel was enlarged in 1823, by which means 200 additional
sittings have been obtained; and in consequence of a grant from
the Society for Promoting the Enlargement and Building of
Churches and Chapels, 150 of that number are free and
unappropriated for ever, in addition to 50 sittings formerly
added; it is provided with galleries, has a small organ, a neat
font, and the east window is beautified with stained glass.&nbsp;
The living is a perpetual curacy in the patronage of the rector
of Edgmond; the Rev. John Baleson is the officiating
minister.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Aston Hall</span> is a
handsome stuccoed mansion, embosomed in foliage, and has been
built about twenty years; it is the property of R. M. Leeke,

Broughton</i>, by will, 1728, gave to Robert Pigott and Henry
Jervis the sum of &pound;650 in trust, and directed the rents or
profits thereof to be applied to the following uses, viz., 20s.
to be laid out in bread and distributed among the poor of the
village on the 28th July; 20s. to be laid out yearly, and
distributed in like manner on the day of the month on which she
should happen to die, and the residue of the yearly profits to be
applied by the trustees in educational purposes, and in
apprenticing poor children of this township.&nbsp; By a decree of
the Court of Chancery, made the 7th of May, 1752, in a cause in
which the Attorney-general, at the relation of Adam Jervis and
Richard Jervis plaintiffs, and Robert Pigott defendant, it was
decreed that &pound;650 should be laid out in the purchase of
stock, which was accordingly invested in the purchase of
&pound;611. 15s. 4d south sea annuities.&nbsp; The costs of the
suit were paid out of a sum of &pound;136. 5s. 8d., which had
accumulated as interest before the stock was purchased.&nbsp; The
trusts of this charity had been very inefficiently carried out
when the charity commissioners published their report.&nbsp; The
amount expended up to the year 1819 was for bread, &pound;103.
15s.; schooling and books, &pound;115. 5s. 10d.; apprenticing,
&pound;120; extra charges on the charity estate, &pound;59. 14s.,

Newport Savings&rsquo; Bank.&nbsp; The interest is distributed
among the poor, with other sums collected for the same purpose
from the parishioners, at Christmas.&nbsp; An annual sum of 5s.
is expended in bread for the poor on Good Friday.</p>

&pound;14,140. 19s. 6&frac12;d.&nbsp; The houses are in general
built of brick, and slated; the cottages are also of brick, and
in many instances the occupants have a small allotment <a
name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>of
ground.&nbsp; The ancient residences of the gentry are in most
instances converted into farm dwellings; there are, however, many
neat villa residences in the modern style of architecture, of a
respectable character, surrounded with park like
enclosures.&nbsp; The soil is chiefly a mixture of sand and loam,
and the land is mostly used for arable purposes, in some
instances large dairies of cheese are made, and the district is
celebrated for a fine breed of sheep.&nbsp; The land is chiefly
tithe free, the tithes on the rest of the parish were commuted in
1841 for &pound;829. 15s.&nbsp; The village of High Ercall is
pleasantly situated eight miles N.E. from Shrewsbury and five and

districts possess so good a soil; the farms are extensive, and in
most cases the land has been greatly improved by superior
cultivation, and removing the fences and throwing the land into
large enclosures.&nbsp; The Duke of Cleveland is lord of the
manor and owner of the whole township.&nbsp; The turnpike roads
to Newport, Shawbury, Wem, Whitchurch, Wellington, and
Shrewsbury, intersect the township.&nbsp; In the 51st of Henry
III., John de Ercalewe had a grant of a market here on a Monday,

Michael, an ancient structure, consists of nave, chancel, and
side aisles, with a massive square tower containing six bells,
and a clock.&nbsp; The side aisles are separated from the nave by
four pointed arches rising from circular pillars; the church is
neatly pewed with oak sittings, and the pulpit and reading desk
are of carved oak of the most elaborate workmanship.&nbsp; The
chancel is lofty and contains several mural monuments, one of
which remembers Sarah, the wife of Edward Steedman, and children,
dated 1834; another remembers the Rev. Henry Wood, who died in
1795; there are also tablets to Cecil Frederick Juckes, the Rev.
Lawrence Gardener, and a full length figure, which exhibits a
fine specimen of chiselling, near the north end of the
church.&nbsp; In the church yard are many monumental tombs of
fine workmanship, to some of the principal families resident in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;17. 6s. 8d., now returned at
&pound;290 in the patronage of the Duke of Cleveland; incumbent,
Rev. Robert Forester, M.A., who resides at the vicarage, a good
brick building a short distance from the church.&nbsp; Near the
west end of the church are the ruins of an ancient structure,
which was formerly moated.&nbsp; Sir Richard Newport, of High
Ercall, Knight, by letters patent, bearing date at Bridgenorth,
14th October, 18th Charles I., was advanced to the dignity of
baron of this realm, by the title of Lord Newport, of High
Ercall.&nbsp; That gentleman advanced six thousand pounds for the
king&rsquo;s use when at Shrewsbury, by which means the artillery
was put in a position to march against the parliamentary forces,
upon which followed the battle of Edge hill.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Hall</span>, an ancient residence with
projecting gables, was built by Sir Francis Newport,
Knight.&nbsp; This house is said to have been garrisoned in the
time of the civil wars.&nbsp; In levelling a mound near it, Mr.
Steedman&rsquo;s labourers discovered about a thousand silver
coins, the greater part of the reign of Charles I., some of
Elizabeth, and others of the reign of Philip and Mary.&nbsp; The
hall is now in the occupancy of Edward Blakeway Steedman,
Esq.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ercall Park</span> is a handsome
structure, the residence of William Holt Midgley, Esq.; it is
built in the Elizabethan style of architecture, and beautified
with shrubberies and pleasure grounds tastefully laid out; the
house is surrounded by large enclosures containing some thriving
plantations.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Sherlowe</span>, the
residence of George Townsend Forester, is a modern structure
built within the last three years, with farm premises on a scale
of considerable magnitude.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Lodge</span>, another good residence of modern construction, is
in the occupancy of Mr. Thomas Jukes.&nbsp; The above houses have
all very extensive out premises, and all the modern appliances,
with steam engines for carrying out the operations of extensive
farms in the most economical manner.</p>
<p><a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span><span
class="smcap">The Free School</span> was founded by Thomas Leeke,
one of the Barons of the Court of Exchequer, in 1663.&nbsp; In
January, 1816, the Attorney-General, at the relation of Ralph
Leeke, filed an information against Rann Dolphin Edwards, and
John Douglas, for the purpose of setting aside a lease which had
been granted in 1772 for a term of 99 years, at the yearly rent
of &pound;30, and for obtaining the directions of the court as to
the future application of the rents.&nbsp; The master by his
report, made 18th February, 1828, and subsequently confirmed by
the court, ordered that the school should be for teaching
English, writing, and accounts free, and also Latin and Greek
when required; the master to charge a guinea a quarter and a
guinea entrance for the latter; that the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
salary should be &pound;50 per annum, with liberty for the
trustees to increase it at their discretion; that no boys should
be admitted until they are capable of reading the New Testament;
that any surplus which should arise from the accumulations of
rent during a vacancy, or from the annual income not expended in
the master&rsquo;s salary, or repairs, should be expended in
rewards to four or more of the scholars at the examination, or
who should be reported by the master to the trustees as deserving
thereof, or in providing a library of useful books for the
school: that the trustees should have power to displace the
master in case of incapacity, immorality, or neglect, and that
the trustees should have power to make such orders as they should
think necessary for the better government of the school.&nbsp;
The master, in a report made June 3rd, 1828, found that the sum
of &pound;960 was due for rent up to Lady Day, 1828, out of which
Mr. Edwards was entitled to retain costs, leaving &pound;831. 1s.
from which &pound;428. 2s. 8d. was paid for the costs of the
other parties, leaving &pound;402. 18s. 4d., which was ordered to
be divided proportionably between the representatives of the two
schoolmasters who had officiated between November, 1815, and
December, 1827.&nbsp; The charity estate is situated near
Trefnanny, in the parishes of Guilsfield and Myford, in the
county of Montgomery, and produces a yearly income of
&pound;93.&nbsp; Out of the income of the charity the master
receives a salary of &pound;50, and he also receives &pound;6.
13s. 4d. per annum in respect of Stevinton&rsquo;s gift.&nbsp;
The school is conducted according to the scheme established by
the Court of Chancery, except that the master makes a charge of
10s. 6d. for the entrance of such boys as are not classical
scholars, which appears to be contrary to the directions of the
court.</p>
<p><i>Richard Stevinton</i>, by his will, in 1652, devised an
annuity of &pound;6. 13s. 4d., payable out of lands at Arleston,
to be applied towards the maintenance of a schoolmaster of High
Ercall, who should teach children resident in the said parish
without any reward from the parents of the children.</p>
<p><i>The Hospital</i> consists of seven dwellings, and each
inmate has a room above and a room below, and a small garden
annexed.&nbsp; The hospital was founded by the Newport
family.&nbsp; The building is kept in repair at the expense of
the Duke of Cleveland, from whose agent the inmates receive
&pound;3 per quarter, with an additional payment of 21s. at
Christmas, and 5s. at Midsummer.&nbsp; The selection of these
persons is not confined to the parishioners or inhabitants of
High Ercall, but are selected from deserving objects residing in
the neighbourhood, a preference being given to those who have
seen better days, and have been reduced by misfortune to
poverty.</p>
<p><i>Poors&rsquo; Land</i>.&mdash;There are two closes in the
township of Eaton, in the parish of Stoke-upon-Trent, which have
for a long period been let from time to time by the
churchwardens.&nbsp; The last lease was dated 29th August, 1795,
and it was therein recited that the then churchwardens of High
Ercall were lawfully seized of the premises, in trust to
distribute the rents among the poor of the parish of High Ercall,
two shillings every fortnight in bread, and the remainder in
money on St. Thomas&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; There does not appear any
documents in the parish to show from whom this land was devised,
or on what trust it is held.&nbsp; The two closes contain
together 3<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 4<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,

<p>Several sums of money, amounting in the whole to &pound;199,
left by eight several donors, <a name="page387"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 387</span>for the benefit of the poor of this
parish, were for many years placed out at interest on private
security, and previous to the year 1814 &pound;40 of the above
sum was lost.&nbsp; About that period the remainder was called
in, and with &pound;20 advanced from the poor&rsquo;s rates, was
laid out in the purchase of certain premises for a parish
workhouse.&nbsp; Since 1814 the sum of &pound;8 has been paid out
of the poor&rsquo;s rates as the interest of this money, and
distributed among poor persons in small sums, seldom exceeding
one shilling.</p>
<p><i>Thomas and Edward Thomas</i>, each gave &pound;100 in
trust, to invest the same for the benefit of the poor of the
parish of High Ercall.&nbsp; These donations were invested by the
trustees in 1798 in the purchase of three per cent. consols,
which were increased in 1816 by the accumulation of dividends to
the sum of &pound;500, when the stock was transferred to John
Colley and Edward Steedman.&nbsp; Of the sum of &pound;193. 8s.
2d. received in 1816 for the arrears of dividends, after payment
of expenses of recovering the same, and the purchase of the
additional stock, there remained in the hands of Mr. Colley the
sum of &pound;74. 6s. 1d., out of which he disposed of &pound;38.
15s. to different charitable purposes, and in 1830 when the
charity commissioners published their report he had still
&pound;35. 11s. 1d. in his hands.&nbsp; The principal part of the
dividends is now applied in the purchase of bread, which is
distributed among poor persons of the parish, a preference being
given to widows, the remainder of the dividends is given among
the necessitous poor in money.</p>

<p>The celebrated nonconformist divine, Richard Baxter, was born
at Rowton, November 12th, 1615.&nbsp; His father was an honest
and religious man, in humble circumstances, but a small
freeholder; his estate, however, was very inconsiderable.&nbsp;
His son is said to have given strong indications of that piety
and purity which appeared in his subsequent life and
conversation.&nbsp; He passed his infancy at Rowton, under the
roof of his grandfather, and in 1625, when about ten years of
age, was removed from Rowton to his father&rsquo;s house at Eaton
Constantine.&nbsp; He received the chief portion of his learning
at Ludlow, but had not the advantages of an academical education;
when at school he had the use of an excellent library, which, by
his great application, proved of infinite service to him.&nbsp;
His first engagements in life it appears was teaching a free
school at Newport, and he was afterwards appointed master of the
free school at Dudley, with an usher under him.&nbsp; While he
taught the school there he read several practical treatises, by
which he was brought to a deep sense of religion, and having an
earnest desire to engage in the ministry, he in 1638 addressed
himself to Dr. Tharnborough, bishop of Worcester, for holy
orders, which, after examination, he received, having at that
time no scruples of conscience which hindered him from conforming
to the Church of England.&nbsp; He shortly after frequently
preached at Dudley, and the neighbouring villages, with great
acceptance among his hearers, but when the <i>et c&aelig;tera</i>
oath came to be imposed, Mr. Baxter applied himself diligently to
study the case of episcopacy as in other instances, the thing
which was intended to fix him to the hierarchy, gave him a
dislike to it.&nbsp; In the year 1640 he accepted the invitation
of the bailiffs and feoffees of Kidderminster to preach there for
an allowance of &pound;60 a year.&nbsp; In the memorable
struggles of this period, he sided with the parliament, and
recommended the protestation they directed to be taken by the
people.&nbsp; This exposed him to some inconveniences which
obliged him for a time to retire to <a name="page391"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 391</span>Gloucester, but be afterwards
returned to Kidderminster and resumed the work of the
ministry.&nbsp; He hindered, as far as it was in his power, the
taking of the covenant, and preached and spoke publicly against
it.&nbsp; When Cromwell assumed the supreme power he was not
afraid to express his dissatisfaction at his tyranny, and in a
conference which he had with him afterwards, stated his views in
terms not to be misunderstood by the Protector.&nbsp; After the
restoration he became one of the king&rsquo;s chaplains in
ordinary, had frequent access to his royal person, and was always
treated by him with peculiar respect.&nbsp; At the Savoy
conference Mr. Baxter assisted as one of the commissioners, and
then drew up the reformed liturgy, which all allow to be an
excellent performance.&nbsp; He was offered the bishopric of
Hereford by the Lord Chancellor Clarendon, which he refused to
accept.&nbsp; At this period he would gladly have returned to his
beloved town of Kidderminster, and have preached there, but this
was refused him.&nbsp; When he found himself thus disappointed,
he preached occasionally about the city of London, and afterwards
returned to Acton, in Middlesex, where he went to church every
Lord&rsquo;s-day, and spent the rest of the day with his family
and a few poor neighbours, in explaining the Scriptures and
prayer.&nbsp; His auditors continued to increase, and shortly
after, upon a warrant signed by two justices, he was committed
for six months to New Prison jail.&nbsp; After the indulgence of
1672 he returned to London, and was one of the Tuesday lecturers
at Pinner&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; He had a Friday lecture at
Fetter-lane, but only preached occasionally on the Sunday.&nbsp;
In 1682 he suffered severely on account of his
nonconformity.&nbsp; One day he was suddenly surprised by an
officer, who apprehended him upon a warrant to seize his person
for coming within five miles of a corporate town; producing, at
the same time, five more warrants to distrain for &pound;195 for
five sermons.&nbsp; At this time he lay on a sick bed, but he was
dragged before five justices, and took his oath that he could not
go to prison without danger of death.&nbsp; But the officers
executed their warrants on the books and goods in the house, and
even sold the bed on which he lay sick.&nbsp; In 1684 he was
bound in a penalty of &pound;400 to keep the peace, by the
justices of Middlesex, and in the year following he was committed
to the King&rsquo;s Bench prison, by a warrant from the Lord
Chief Justice Jefferies, for his paraphrase on the New Testament;
the trial took place on the 30th of May, when he was found
guilty, and received a severe sentence.&nbsp; In 1686 the king,
by the mediation of Lord Powis, granted him a pardon.&nbsp; After
this he settled in Charter house yard, contenting himself with
the exercise of his ministry, as assistant to Mr.
Silvester.&nbsp; He died on the 8th of December, 1691, and was
buried in Christ Church.&nbsp; His remains were followed to the
grave by a large concourse of people of all ranks and qualities,
who prudently paid this last tribute of respect to a great and
good man, whose labours deserved much from true Christians of all
denominations.&nbsp; Mr. Baxter was in several respects one of
the most eminent persons of his time; he preached more sermons,
wrote more books, and engaged in more controversies than any
other nonconformist of his age.&nbsp; He spoke, disputed, and
wrote with ease, and discovered the same intrepidity when he
reproved Cromwell, and expostulated with Charles II., as when he
preached to a congregation of mechanics.&nbsp; His works are
extremely voluminous, and they are still held in high
estimation.&nbsp; An eminent divine observes of them, that his
practical writings were never mended, his controversial, seldom
refuted.&nbsp; The celebrated Doddridge, in a letter to a friend
in 1723, says, &ldquo;Baxter is my particular favourite.&nbsp; It
is impossible to tell how much I am charmed with the devotion,
good sense, and pathos, which is every where to be found in
him.&nbsp; I cannot forbear looking upon him as one of the
greatest orators, both with regard to copiousness, acuteness, and
energy that our nation hath produced.&rdquo;</p>

The celebrated Edward Herbert, Lord Chirbury, was born at this
place.&nbsp; His lordship stood in the highest rank among the
public ministers, historians, and philosophers of the age in
which he lived.&nbsp; Lord Herbert was the first and most candid
of our English infidels, and his system of deism contains less of
acrimonious censure of Christianity than that of any other
writer.&nbsp; He was created Knight of the Bath at the accession
of James I.&nbsp; He distinguished himself at the siege of
Juliers; and, in 1616, was sent ambassador to Louis XIII., but
was recalled on account of a dispute between him and the
Constable De Luynes.&nbsp; In 1625 he was created a baron of the
kingdom of Ireland, and in 1631 was elevated to the English

<h3>KINNERSLEY</h3>
<p>is a parish and village, in a pleasant situation, three miles
and a half N.N.W. from Wellington, which in 1801 contained 210
inhabitants; in 1841 there were 49 houses and a population of 295
souls.&nbsp; The parish comprises 1,789<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 36<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land.&nbsp; Gross estimated rental,
&pound;2,720.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;2,443. 3s.&nbsp; There
are 104<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 14<span class="smcap">p</span>. of woods
and plantations, and 75 acres of glebe land.&nbsp; The Duke of
Sutherland is lord of the manor and owner of the land.&nbsp; The
village is surrounded by what is called moor-land, which was
enclosed about half a century ago.&nbsp; It has, however, lost
all the characteristics of a moor, and is now chiefly in large
enclosures, and generally good grazing land.&nbsp; About half a
mile north-east from the church there is a large mound, which
encloses upwards of twenty acres of land, and surrounds the
premises of the Wall Farm.&nbsp; This is supposed to have been a
British encampment, and to have been raised before the moors
became boggy; for there is no trace of any road across the moors
by which this vast rampart of sand-rock could be conveyed, which
must have been the case, if the moss at those early periods was
as boggy as in after ages.&nbsp; The rampart measures 1,900 yards
in circumference, and is from sixteen to twenty feet in
breadth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a small structure,
mantled with ivy, and dedicated to St. Chad.&nbsp; It consists of
nave and chancel, with a tower at the west end, in which are
three bells.&nbsp; There is also a small gallery at the west end;
and neat tablets have been erected in memory of the Marriot and
Ogle families.&nbsp; The body of the church is very ancient, but
the tower was erected in 1726.&nbsp; The living is a rectory,
valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;6. 1s. 8d., now
returned at &pound;494.&nbsp; Patron, Duke of Sutherland;

<h3>LEIGHTON</h3>
<p>is a parish and delightful little village, situate on the
banks of the Severn, and near the foot of the Wrekin hill, nine
miles S.E. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In 1801 the parish contained
338 inhabitants; 1831, 360; and in 1841, 80 houses and a
population of 403 souls.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;2,691.&nbsp; Robert Gardner, Esq., and Sir George Harnage,
Bart., are the principal landowners.&nbsp; The soil is mostly of
a superior <a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
394</span>quality, and produces good crops of all kinds of
grain.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to
St. Mary, is a plain brick structure, situated a short distance
from the village, and consists of nave and chancel, with a small
tower, in which are three bells.&nbsp; In the chancel are several
handsome tablets, chiefly in memory of the Leighton and
Kinnersley families, who formerly resided here, and had large
possessions in this locality.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage,
valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;7. 12s. 6d., now
returned at &pound;224, in the patronage and incumbency of the
Rev. Robert Maddocks.&nbsp; The salubrious situation of Leighton
and the vicinity is proverbial, and several extraordinary cases
of longevity among the inhabitants have occurred.&nbsp; A short
time ago, Stephen Davies was living at the advanced age of 97
years.&nbsp; He recollected old Sarah Beech, who lived in this
parish, and died about the year 1738 at the age of 106 years, and
who had a sister that lived to the age of 103 years.&nbsp;
Stephen Davies had then a brother living at Wroxeter of the age
of 96 years.</p>

<h3>LILLESHALL</h3>
<p>is a parish in the Newport division of the South Bradford
hundred, which comprises the townships of Lilleshall, Donington,
and Muxton, and embraces 6,111<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 9<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land.&nbsp; In 1801 the parish had a population of 2,060 souls;
1831, 3,596; and in 1841 there were 708 houses and 3,851
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;12,034. 1s. 8d.&nbsp;
The Duke of Sutherland is lord of the manor, and owner of the
whole parish, except about half a dozen acres, the property of
Mr. John Bradborn, in the township of Muxton.&nbsp; The village
of Lilleshall is pleasantly situated on the acclivity of a hill,
three miles south-west from Newport.&nbsp; The township in 1841
contained 155 houses and 795 inhabitants; the houses are
scattered, and the population find employment in the extensive
collieries and iron works with which the vicinity abounds.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a venerable structure
mantled with ivy, and dedicated to St. Mary; in the tower is a
peal of six bells.&nbsp; On the north side of the chancel is an
altar tomb, with two full length figures, in memory of dame
Catherine Leveson and Sir Richard Leveson: the former died March
31st, 1674, and the latter June 2nd, 1661.&nbsp; The old font,
about twenty years ago, was used as a cistern to a pump at
Lilleshall old hall; it was removed by the late vicar, and now
stands at the west end of the church.&nbsp; The living is a
vicarage, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;6. 17s. 11d.;
now returned at &pound;338; in the patronage of the Duke of
Sutherland; incumbent, Rev. Henry George Bunsen; curate, Rev.
Thomas Bucknall Lloyd.&nbsp; On Lilleshall Hill, in this parish,
a monument was erected in 1839, to the memory of the first Duke
of Sutherland; on June 20th, 1839, it was struck with lightning,
and sustained considerable damage; but it was shortly after put
in a state of complete reparation.&nbsp; On the north side is the
following inscription.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>To the
memory of<br />
George Granville Leveson Gower, K G<br />
First Duke of Sutherland,<br />
The most just and generous of landlords.<br />
This monument is erected<br />
by the occupiers of his Grace&rsquo;s Shropshire farms,<br />
as a public testimony that he<br />
went down to the grave with the blessings<br />
of his tenants on his head,<br />
and left behind him upon his estates<br />
the best inheritance which a gentleman of England<br />
can bequeath to his son:<br />
men ready to stand by his house<br />
heart and hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the south side of the monument is the inscription,
&ldquo;Let all the ends thou aimest at be thy country&rsquo;s,
thy God&rsquo;s, and truth&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is related
that at the trial of Queen Caroline, the Lord Chancellor Eldon,
in his charge to the peers, told them to &ldquo;Be just and fear
not,&rdquo; when the Duke of Sutherland immediately rose from his
place in the house and declared that he echoed the sentiments of
his noble and learned friend on the wool sack, and would copy the
immortal bard still farther by saying, &ldquo;Let all the ends
thou aimest at be thy country&rsquo;s, thy God&rsquo;s, and
truth&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the occasion of the
inscription being placed on the monument.&nbsp; The obelisk was
designed by Sir Francis Chantrey.</p>
<p>His Grace, in March, 1803, succeeded to the trust estates and
canal of his maternal uncle, the late Duke of Bridgewater, and in
October in the same year, by the death of his father, he became
Marquis of Stafford, and entered into possession of the paternal
estates of the Leveson branch of the family, in Staffordshire and
Shropshire, and to the ancient patrimony of the Gowers of
Yorkshire.&nbsp; For some time he filled the office of postmaster
general, and was ambassador to the court of France at the
commencement of the revolution in that country.&nbsp; His titles
were George Grenville, Duke of Sutherland, Marquis of the County
of Stafford, Earl Gower, Viscount Trentham, Baron Gower of
Sittenham, and a baronet.&nbsp; His Grace was also a Knight of
the Garter, and a Privy Councillor.&nbsp; Among the near
relations of the Duke of Sutherland may be enumerated the
distinguished families of Bedford, Rutland, Lansdowne,
Marlborough, Dorset, Kingston, Waldegrave, Jersey, Thanet, and
Warwick.&nbsp; The Shropshire estates of the Duke of Sutherland
are upwards of 20,000 acres.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The National School</span>, a plain brick
structure a little south from the church, has an attendance of
about eighty boys and sixty girls.&nbsp; It is supported by the
Duke of Sutherland and a small charge from each scholar.&nbsp;
There are about three roods of garden ground attached to the
school, which is divided into twenty allotments, and cultivated
by twenty of the senior scholars for their own benefit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lilleshall Abbey</span>.&mdash;In a
solitary and retired situation, about a mile south from the
church, may be seen the ruins of Lilleshall Abbey.&nbsp; At the
great western entrance is a fine Norman arch, richly recessed
with ribs and running foliage.&nbsp; The pillars and arches of
the church have been entirely destroyed, but the doors and
windows still remain.&nbsp; The south door, by which a
communication was formed with the cloister, is doubtless one of
the most highly ornamented arches in the kingdom.&nbsp; A
semi-circular arch, overspread with ornaments peculiar to the
Saxon and early Norman buildings, is supported by clusters of
slender shafts, some of which are spiral, and others covered with
lozenge work, having the intermediate spaces embellished with
mouldings.&nbsp; The east window of the choir has a beautiful
pointed arch of the fourteenth century, and the north and south
windows are narrow plain, and round headed.&nbsp; The walls of
the refectory have been converted into a residence.&nbsp; The
church was cruciform, and had probably two towers: one in <a
name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 396</span>the centre
and the other at the west end; the breadth of the nave is
thirty-six feet, and the length two hundred and twenty-eight
feet.&nbsp; The boundary wall of the abbey encompassed several
acres, and in some parts is still entire.&nbsp; The ruins of the
abbey are scattered over a large space, and the walls, which in
some parts are mantled with ivy, are of considerable height, and
the fragments of superb workmanship still to be seen show it to
have been a place of great magnificence and architectural
grandeur.&nbsp; The stalls of the choir at the dissolution were
removed to the collegiate church of Wolverhampton, where they now
remain.&nbsp; Richard de Belmeis, says Bishop Tanner, the last
dean of the collegiate church of St. Alkmund, in Shrewsbury,
about the year 1145, with the consent of pope Eugenius and King
Stephen, surrendered up that church with all the lands and
churches belonging to the same to the use of some regular canons
of the order of St. Augustine, who came from Dorsetshire and
began to build an abbey to the honour of the blessed virgin, upon
one of the prebendal estates, here in the wood of Lilleshall, to
which his kinsman, Philip de Belmeis was an early and great
benefactor.&nbsp; Other authorities state that in the time of the
Saxon dynasty a religious house was dedicated here to the use of
secular canons or prebendaries, and afterwards became a nunnery,
which was reduced to a state of desolation by the predatory
incursions of the Welsh tribes, and it so continued until about
the year 1145.&nbsp; Among the principal benefactors to this
abbey were Alanta Zouche John le Strange, who gave the church of
Hulme; and Hillaria de Trussebut, the wife of Robert de Bulders,
who gave certain lands, and directed her body to be buried within
the precincts of the abbey.&nbsp; In the 34th Henry III. the
abbot had leave to grub up twenty-three acres in the woods of
Lilleshall, and in the 7th of Edward to make an assart of the
wood near Watling street, in the forest of Wombridge.&nbsp; In
the 11th of Edward I. the abbot had leave to make a park.&nbsp;
The abbey was endowed at subsequent periods by different pious
individuals, and the annual income at the general dissolution of
religious houses was valued at &pound;229. 3s. per annum.&nbsp;
On account of the situation of this monastery, near the Chester
road, the abbots were sometimes known to complain that their
income was too scanty to entertain the continual influx of
visitors that travelled that road.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Sir Richard
Leveson</i>, by will, dated 5th of November, 1660, gave to the
poor people inhabiting the parish of Lilleshall a rent charge of
&pound;5 per annum, issuing out of certain lands called Kainton
Meadow.&nbsp; The Marquis of Stafford pays this gift yearly,
which is distributed on St. Thomas&rsquo;s-day by the minister
and churchwardens.&nbsp; There is a piece of land still called
Kainton Meadow, which is no doubt the land charged by the
testator.</p>
<p><i>Lady Catherine Leveson</i>, by her will, in 1670, devised
to trustees her manor of Foxley, in Northamptonshire, and
directed the yearly proceeds to be put to charitable uses; among
others to the payment of &pound;120 a year to the maintenance of
twelve poor widows, three of whom were to be inhabitants of the
parish of Lilleshall, and she directed that there should be
provided by the minister and parish officers, out of the
&pound;10 respectively allowed for their maintenance, a gown of
grey cloth, upon the breast of which gown the letters of K. L. in
blue cloth should be set, which gown should be constantly wore by
the widows, and if any one should refuse to wear them she should
lose the benefit of the charity.&nbsp; The testator gave a
further sum of &pound;100 yearly to be applied in putting forth
ten poor boys apprentices, two of whom should be children of the
inhabitants of Lilleshall.&nbsp; In respect of this charity
&pound;50 a year is received by the churchwardens of Lilleshall,
out of which &pound;10 a year are paid to three poor widows,
appointed by the minister, churchwardens, and overseers of the
poor, a preference being given to such as have fallen into
poverty from better circumstances, and have not received
parochial relief.&nbsp; The gowns have not been provided for them
for many years.&nbsp; Two boys are usually apprenticed every year
with premiums of &pound;10 each.&nbsp; Upon inspection of the
parish books which commence in 1634, it appears that various
small benefactions have been given to the poor, which were placed
in the hands of different persons, who paid <a
name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span>interest
for them.&nbsp; These sums appear to have passed in various
proportions to other persons, and the interest thereon to have
fluctuated so as to afford no certain information as to the
amount or donation of the benefactions.&nbsp; In the year 1718
the poor&rsquo;s stock appears to have amounted to
&pound;40.&nbsp; In 1734 the sum of &pound;56 was put by the
churchwardens into the parish chest for the use of the
poor.&nbsp; No further entry occurs till 1757, when a sum of
&pound;20 appears to have been in the hands of Charles Lawrence,
and &pound;15 in the hands of Henry Barber.&nbsp; The &pound;20
subsequently passed into the hands of Robert Garmeson, who in
1786 gave his note of hand for the money, and shortly after died
insolvent.&nbsp; The entries of receipt of interest of the
&pound;15 cease in 1800, for several years previous to which it
appears to have been paid by Mr. James Barber, about which time
he died in bad circumstances, so that this sum may also be
considered as lost.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lilleshall House</span>, the magnificent
seat of the Marquis of Stafford, is situated on a commanding
eminence, from which extensive and beautiful prospects of the
surrounding country are seen.&nbsp; The mansion is about a mile
from the ruins of Lilleshall Abbey, within the bounds of the
parish of Sheriff Hales, and was erected by the late Duke of
Sutherland; it is built of beautiful white free stone, and
exhibits a fine specimen of the Tudor style of architecture, from
designs by Sir John Wyattville.&nbsp; The garden and pleasure
grounds are laid out with admirable taste, and cover between
forty and fifty acres.&nbsp; The flower garden from its extent
and the beautiful order in which it is kept is surpassed by few
in the kingdom; the manner of planting the flowers of one
particular colour so as to form the greatest contrast with the
beds contiguous to it has a most brilliant and dazzling
effect.&nbsp; An avenue in the garden, which stretches 300 yards
in length, has a very pleasing appearance; the frame work is of
wood, to which are trained roses, japonicas, the various sorts of
clamitas, and fruit trees, and in the delightful season when the
clustering fruits hang in profusion, enriched with the autumnal
tints, among the beautiful blossoms of the japonica and
rose&mdash;the whole has a most enchanting appearance.&nbsp; The
terrace commands a fine view of the park, the woody scenery in
the vicinity, and a large tract of the country extending over
North Shropshire into Staffordshire, Cheshire, and the
mountainous district of Wales.</p>

<p>is a considerable township with a scattered population,
situated about a mile W. from Lilleshall, and four miles S.W.
from Newport.&nbsp; At the census in 1811 there were 498 houses
and 2,757 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in the extensive
iron works, collieries, and ironstone mines, with which this
neighbourhood abounds.&nbsp; The collieries vary from 100 to 300
yards in depth, and there are twelve seams from which coal is
got; the mines from which the ironstone is procured are also of
very great depths; the country extending south and south west for
several miles present one vast field of collieries and iron
works, and has a teeming population, all busily employed in these
and their subordinate manufactures and employments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a neat modern

<h3>MUXTON</h3>
<p>is a township in the parish of Lilleshall, situate near a mile
W. from the church, and three and a half miles S.W. from Newport,
the acres and value of which are included with the parish.&nbsp;
The land is the property of the Duke of Sutherland, with the
exception of about six acres, the property of Mr. John
Bradborn.&nbsp; At the census in 1841 there were 55 houses and
299 inhabitants.&nbsp; Mrs. Rebecca Walthall by will 1740
bequeathed &pound;10 to the churchwardens of Lilleshall, and
directed the interest thereof to be distributed to the poor of
Muxton on St. Thomas&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; It does not appear that
this legacy were paid to the churchwardens of Lilleshall.&nbsp;
An annual sum of 5s. was paid to them by the late Isaac H.
Browne, Esq., and is still paid by the agent of his widow, which
is supposed to be on account of the above benefaction, and to
have been charged on an estate derived from Mrs. Walthall by Mr.
Browne, which he sold some time ago in various lots.&nbsp; It is
more probable however that the money had been left at interest <a

hands of the residuary legatees, and that this 5s. was Mr.
Browne&rsquo;s share of such interest.&nbsp; A similar sum was
formerly paid by Mr. Walthall, the other residuary legatee and
administrator, who resided at Wistaston, in Cheshire, but this
payment has been discontinued many years.&nbsp; The 5s. paid by
Mrs. Browne is distributed among the poor of this township.</p>

ancient Watling Street, and near the eastern confines of the
county, eleven miles S. from Market Drayton, seventeen E.N.E.
from Shrewsbury, and 139 miles N.W. by N. from London.&nbsp; The
town principally consists of one spacious, handsome street,
stretching for about a mile in length, containing many good inns,
private residences, and respectable shops in all the different
branches of the retail trade.&nbsp; About the centre of the town,
and in the middle of the street, stands the venerable parish
church, an ancient market house, and a few dwellings, which are
some of the oldest houses in the town of Newport.&nbsp; The
parish in 1801 contained 2,307 inhabitants; 1831, 2,745; and in
1841 there were 553 houses and 2,497 inhabitants.&nbsp; The

from large cisterns and wells in various parts of the town, which
are filled from a spring, about a mile distant, by means of a
water-course and pipes, the expenses of which are paid from the
income arising from the common lands.&nbsp; Newport was granted
municipal privileges as early as the reign of Henry I., which
were confirmed by succeeding sovereigns.&nbsp; The government is
vested is a high steward, deputy steward, two bailiffs, and
twenty-five burgesses.&nbsp; John Cotes, Esq., is the high
steward; Robert Fisher, jun., Esq., deputy steward; and William
Washbourne, Esq., and G. H. Duncalfe.&nbsp; Esq., are the

Borough, Esq.; and John Justice, Esq.&nbsp; The principal
features in the trade of Newport are the engineering
establishment and brass foundry of Messrs. Massey; the
manufacture of agricultural implements by Mr. Underhill; and
those belonging to Mr. Thomas Boughey and Mr. Lewis
Atkins&mdash;ingenious establishments for the manufacture of all
descriptions of bendware, wood turnery, together with hair sieves
and dairy requisites of the most approved descriptions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a venerable structure
of red sand-stone, situated nearly in the centre of
High-street.&nbsp; It consists of nave, chancel, and side aisles,
with a square tower and an illuminated clock; the tower is dated
1,662; but this probably is the date of certain reparations, for
the upper and some other parts of the tower appear to have been
re-faced.&nbsp; The chancel and side aisles are of red brick, and
were rebuilt in the year 1728, previously to which the church
exhibited a beautiful specimen of the architecture of the
fifteenth century.&nbsp; The interior has a spacious and handsome
appearance.&nbsp; The roof is of groined timber, and the nave is
separated from the side aisles by five pointed arches on each
side.&nbsp; It contains a small organ, and there are some neat
mural tablets.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, valued at
&pound;297, in the patronage of the Lord Chancellor; incumbent,
Rev. William Sandford, M.A.&nbsp; The Abbot and Convent of St.
Peter and St. Paul, at Shrewsbury, were patrons of the church at
Newport; from them it was purchased in the twentieth of Henry
VI., by Thomas Draper, citizen of London, who made it collegiate,
placing in it a warden, who was to be in priests&rsquo; orders,
and four chaplains or fellows, who were to pray for the King and
the Royal Family, and for the soul of Humphrey, Duke of
Gloucester, (the King&rsquo;s uncle,) and for the fraternity of
St. Marie&rsquo;s Guild in the church of Newport.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Catholic Church</span>, dedicated to
St. Peter and St. Paul, is situated at the outskirts of the town,
on the site of an ancient residence called Salter&rsquo;s Hall,
which was long the inheritance of the Shrewsbury family,
adjoining which was a domestic chapel.&nbsp; The present
structure was built about twenty years ago by the Earl of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The interior of the structure presents a chaste
and elegant appearance; the seats or benches are all open and
uniform in character, and the altar is richly carved and gilt; on
each side of it are beautifully carved figures of the Blessed
Virgin Mary and Joseph.&nbsp; The windows on each side of the
altar are adorned with representations of St. Peter and St. Paul,
the patron saints of the church.&nbsp; The Rev. Michael Trovell
is the priest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span>, situated on
the Wellington road, is a neat stuccoed structure, erected in the
year 1817, at a cost of &pound;1,300.&nbsp; It is provided with
galleries, and is calculated to hold four hundred hearers.&nbsp;
There is a flourishing congregation connected with this place of
worship, who enjoy the talented ministrations of the Rev. William
Berkeley Leach.&nbsp; The Sunday school in connection with the
chapel is numerously attended.&nbsp; The old Independent chapel,
which stood in Beaumaris lane, has been converted into two
cottages.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel</span> is a

<p>The <span class="smcap">Free Grammar
School</span>.&mdash;<i>William Adams</i>, of the city of London,
devised certain lands for the endowment of a grammar school and
other charitable uses, in Newport, in 1656.&nbsp; By an act of
parliament passed in the 12th year of the reign of King Charles
II., after reciting the erection of the school-houses and
alms-houses by William Adams, and his settlement of lands for the
maintenance thereof, it was enacted that the master and four
wardens of the Company of Haberdashers in London for the time
being, and their successors, should be governors of the
possessions of the Free Grammar School of Newport; and that they
should have a common seal, for the sealing of their affairs, and
hold all possessions granted by Mr. Adams for the maintenance of
the school and other charitable uses.&nbsp; Among the objects of
the trust Mr. Adams directed &pound;20 yearly to be paid to the
minister of Newport, for his encouragement in the works of the
ministry, and upon the condition that the preacher for the time
being should weekly catechise the scholars, children, and
servants of the town of Newport, or such of them as for that
purpose should repair to the parish church; and if the preacher
should wilfully neglect to perform the weekly duty, the governors
should apply the said &pound;20 for the benefit of the poor, or
in such charitable uses as they should think fit.&nbsp; A yearly
sum of &pound;60 was to be paid to the schoolmaster, and
&pound;20 to the usher; also &pound;24 per annum to the inmates
of the four alms-houses which he caused to be erected, and a like
annual sum to be paid in apprentice fees, with various other
gifts.&nbsp; The estate which Mr. Adams devised is situated at
Knighton, in Staffordshire, and comprises 797<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 26<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land.&nbsp; There is also a farm
situated at Woodseves, in the parish of Market Drayton,
containing 85<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 38<span class="smcap">p</span>., which
was purchased with the sum of &pound;500, obtained from a sale of
timber cut from the Knighton estate.&nbsp; In 1667 the testator
demised the premises at Knighton for a term of twenty-one years
to Luke Justice, at the annual rent of &pound;175; and in 1714
the governors, on the surrender of the lease, which had become
vested in William Justice, re-demised the premises to the said
William Justice for another term of seventy years, at the same
rent.&nbsp; The provisions of the will in behalf of Luke Justice
were evidently intended as matter of favour to that individual;
but it is difficult to conceive that two successive terms,
embracing a period of 106 years, were in contemplation of the
testator, when he authorized the granting of a lease for so long
a time.&nbsp; Upon the expiration of the last lease the premises
were let in several farms, on leases of twenty-one years and a
half, at rents amounting to &pound;476. 14s., which considerably
exceeded the amount of the several payments prescribed by the
founder; and it became necessary to obtain the directions of a
Court of Chancery as to the disposal of the surplus.&nbsp; In the
course of the proceedings which were instituted on that occasion,
the heir-at-law of William Adams interposed his claim to the
surplus rents beyond the sum of &pound;175, the amount of the
several charitable uses appointed by the founder; but it was
determined by the court that there was no resulting trust in the
charity estate for the said heir-at-law.&nbsp; By a decree made
November, 1797, and a subsequent decree made December, 1808, on
the occasion of a further advance of the rents to the sum of
&pound;768. 17s., a scheme for the disbursement of the income was
established, which augmented the expenditure to &pound;692 per
annum.&nbsp; The leases having expired in 1814, new leases were
granted under the direction of the court, and the advanced rents
made the yearly income &pound;957. 3s. 6d.&nbsp; From this fund
the head master receives &pound;200 per annum, the second master
&pound;100, and the third &pound;100.&nbsp; The other principal
items of expenditure are a sum of &pound;60 per annum paid to the
minister of Newport; to putting out three apprentices yearly,
&pound;54; exhibitions to four scholars at the university,
&pound;90; to the four alms-people, &pound;78; to twenty-four
persons free of the Haberdashers&rsquo; Company, &pound;75; an
allowance for books, &pound;10; repairs of the school-house and
alms-house, &pound;10; to a boy for ringing the school bell,
&pound;3; to a boy for sweeping the <a name="page403"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 403</span>school, &pound;3; to the clerk of
the Haberdashers&rsquo; Company, &pound;6; to the two beadles,
&pound;3; Woodreave, &pound;2; the receiver, &pound;21; besides
which there are several small items for incidental expenses.</p>
<p>The school premises is a spacious building situated a little
back from the High street, and is respectively appropriated to
the use of the school, and to the residence of the master and
usher, as directed by the founder.&nbsp; By the statutes of the
school it was intended for the instruction of eighty scholars;
but the town of Newport and its neighbourhood, to which a
preference was given by the founder, not being able to supply the
full number, the scholars are admitted indifferently from other
parts; and to facilitate their admission, it has been left to the
head master to appoint them on their application to him, without
the intervention of visitors, on whom that duty was imposed by
the statutes.&nbsp; The course of education was intended to
embrace the Hebrew language; but it appears to have been hitherto
confined in practice to Greek and Latin, with the addition of
writing and arithmetic.&nbsp; In December, 1850, there were 59
scholars on the foundation.&nbsp; Charles Waring Saxon, D.D., is
the head master; Rev. William Sandford, M.A., second master; Mr.
Richard Crowther, third master.&nbsp; The particulars of the four
exhibitions on Careswell&rsquo;s foundation will be found noticed
with Bridgnorth Grammar School.&nbsp; The alms-houses above
mentioned are situated near the gates, at the entrance to the
Grammar School.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The English School</span> is a neat brick
building, erected in 1843, and situated on the Wellington
road.&nbsp; This school appears to have had its origin in a
certain grammar school, which, by the certificate of the
commissioners under the statute of the 1st of Edward VI., now
remaining in the augmentation office, was certified to have been
always kept by Richard Robins, one of the Fellows of the college
of Newport, to whom was paid out of the revenues of that college
the annual stipend of &pound;5.&nbsp; In the twenty-third year of
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, her Majesty granted to Edmund
Downing and Peter Ashton, &ldquo;all that site of the late
college of Newport, in the county of Salop, late the possession
of the said college, with all rights, members, and appurtenances,
rendering to her said Majesty &pound;15 yearly, to be paid for a
salary or stipendary curate of Newport, and school-master
there&mdash;that is to say, to the curate &pound;10, and to the
schoolmaster &pound;5.&rdquo;&nbsp; William Robson, in 1633,
deposited &pound;5,000 in the hands of the Salters&rsquo; Company
for charitable uses, among which he directed &pound;5 per annum
to be paid to the master of the free school at Newport, and
&pound;10 per annum to a lecturer, and a like sum annually for
the benefit of the poor.&nbsp; William Adams gave to the bailiffs
and burgesses of Newport, and their successors for ever, all
those two closes, situate at Norbroom, upon trust, to apply the
rents for the support of the English school.&nbsp; William
Barnfield, in 1665, gave &ldquo;six days&rsquo; work of ground in
Norbroom, four tenements let for 16s. a year each, and a shop let
for 30s. per annum, towards the support of the free
school.&rdquo;&nbsp; The total income, when, the charity
commissioners published their report, amounted to &pound;49. 1s.,
of which &pound;24 arises from Adams&rsquo;s gift, &pound;15.
11s. from Barnfield&rsquo;s, &pound;5 from Robson&rsquo;s
benefaction, and &pound;4. 10s. from the receiver-general.&nbsp;
The school has long been confined to the instruction of children
in reading English, and we find it described by the name of the
English school as early as 1660.&nbsp; How long before that
period it had ceased to teach grammar we have not been able to
discover; but it may reasonably be conjectured to have been about
the time when that branch of education became otherwise so
largely provided for by the establishment of the Free Grammar
School of William Adams.&nbsp; The school is free to the children
of the humbler classes of society for instruction in English:
fifty-four scholars now attend.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Infant School</span>, situate on the
Wellington road, was built in 1841 at a cost of &pound;250; the
room is spacious and lofty, and has an average attendance of 95
scholars.&nbsp; The Sunday school in connection with the

has an attendance of 150 children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Town&rsquo;s Almshouses</span>.&nbsp;
In 1446 the burgesses or commonalty of Newport granted to William
Glover a plot of land between the church-yard and the
king&rsquo;s highway, towards the north, between two stiles in
the said church-yard, that the said William Glover should build
on the land a hospital for the use of the poor.&nbsp; The
almshouses are appropriated to the use of four poor old women of
the town of Newport, who are appointed from time to time by the
trustees, and retain their respective places for life.&nbsp; The
rents of lands and dividends of funded property, left by various
benefactors, produced a yearly income of &pound;69. 14s. when the
charity commissioners published their report.&nbsp; Each inmate
has a weekly payment of 4s. 6d. from Lady-day to Michaelmas, and
5s. from Michaelmas to Lady-day.&nbsp; They also receive 10s.
each for coals, and a gratuity of 5s. each at Christmas.&nbsp;
The present almshouse was built in 1836, and is situate in
Workhouse lane.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Savings&rsquo; Bank</span>, held at

separate accounts, of which twelve were charitable and seven

name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 405</span>the
official business of the county court is also transacted
here.&nbsp; An adjoining room is used as a Sunday school.&nbsp;
The Market Hall was chiefly erected at the expense of William
Adams, the munificent founder of the Grammar School, who
&ldquo;gave &pound;550 towards building a town
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Near to the Market Hall is a butter market, a
covered area, which is of more modern construction.&nbsp; Under
this covering is the market cross, a structure of considerable
antiquity, consisting of four steps, and a fluted pillar broken
at the top, the whole much dilapidated by time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fairs</span>.&mdash;The chartered fairs at
Newport have merged into the fortnightly cattle market, held
every alternate Tuesday, except the fair held on May 28th, which
is still continued.&nbsp; These markets are well attended by the
farmers in the surrounding district, and considerable quantities
of fat and other stock are sold.&nbsp; Whether the growing
importance of the Shrewsbury cattle market, which is held on the
same day, will not tend to diminish the number of buyers at
Newport remains to be seen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Gas Works</span>, situate in Marsh
lane, were established in 1835 by a company of shareholders with
a capital stock of &pound;1,800, since which &pound;400 has been
added to the capital.&nbsp; There are two gasometers, each of
which will hold about 8,000 cubic feet of gas.&nbsp; A charge of
7s. 6d. per 1000 cubic foot is now made to the consumer.&nbsp;
The expense of lighting the streets is paid from the income
arising from the town lands, and the cost of pitching the streets
is also paid from the same source.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Lock-up</span>, situate on the
Stafford road, has been built within the last few years.&nbsp; It
is a small structure with two cells, and residence for the
constable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Railway Station</span> is situated
about half a mile S.E. from the church, within the bounds of the
township of Field Aston.&nbsp; There are six trains each way
daily; an omnibus meets the different trains, and calls at the
principal inns in the town.&nbsp; Newport is distant 17&frac12;
miles from Shrewsbury and 11&frac12; miles from Stafford by
railway.</p>
<p>Newport sustained great damage by a fire which broke out on
the 16th May, 1655; it consumed 162 houses, the loss of which
with what they contained was estimated at &pound;30,000.&nbsp; It
is stated that a festival was formerly kept on the 30th August,
in memory of Mr. Adams, the founder of the Grammar School and
almshouses.&nbsp; Tradition says that Charles II., being informed
what large sums Mr. Adams had expended in charitable uses,
expressed a desire to see him when he was on a visit to the city;
and Mr. Adams being introduced to his Majesty, the King asked him
whether he had not straitened his fortune by his great
benefactions.&nbsp; Mr. Adams replied that he had not, and if his
Majesty pleased he would present him with &pound;1,000, provided
he would procure an act of parliament to exempt his land from
taxes, to which the king consented.&nbsp; How far the above may
be true we are unable to affirm; it is certain, however, that the
estate at Knighton, with which the Grammar School is endowed, is
exempt from parliamentary and parochial taxation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Marsh Trust</span>.&mdash;By an Act of
Parliament passed in the 4th of George III., intituled &ldquo;An
act for dividing and inclosing a waste ground called the Marsh,
in the township of Newport, in the county of Salop, and for
applying the produce thereof to the several purposes therein
mentioned;&rdquo; after reciting that there was within the said
township a common waste ground called the Marsh, containing 117
acres, or thereabouts, wherein each householder in the said town
had from time immemorial a right of turning a milch cow, which
privilege had proved of very little advantage to the town, but
rather an inconvenience, by increasing the poor thereof; and that
it was apprehended that the enclosing and improving the said
Marsh, and applying the profits thereof from time to time, after
making satisfaction to the lords of the manor for their
respective rights therein, in paving and keeping in repair the
streets of the town of Newport, and in keeping in repair the
Market Hall and Cross there; and also in establishing and
encouraging some manufacture, and in apprenticing the children of
the poor parishioners of Newport, would be of great advantage to
the town in general, and might be a means of <a
name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 406</span>extending a
manufactory throughout the neighbourhood; it was enacted, that
certain persons therein named, and their heirs and successors
respectively should be trustees, for enclosing, improving, and
dividing the said Marsh, and for putting the said act into
execution: and it was further enacted, that from and immediately
after passing that act, all right of common or pasturage in or
upon the said Marsh should cease and be extinguished; and the
trustees were authorized to set out to the Earl of Shrewsbury
such portion of the Marsh as two indifferent persons should
appoint, as a recompense and satisfaction for the said
earl&rsquo;s four beast-gates upon the Marsh: and it was further
enacted, that the residue of the said Marsh, after the allotment
so made, should be vested in the said trustees and their
successors, and be freed from all right, title, and interest
whatsoever, of the householders of the township.</p>
<p>A survey being made in pursuance of the directions of the act,
the Marsh was found to contain 111<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 31<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
of which four acres being allotted to the Earl of Shrewsbury for
beast-gates, there remained 107<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 31<span class="smcap">p</span>. to
be employed for the beneficial objects of the trust.&nbsp; This
remainder, the trustees then proceeded to inclose and subdivide;
and as an effective mode of providing for the fencing-in and
improvement of the different parcels, they granted leases for 99
years, determinable on three lives, binding the lessees by
covenants to plant and set the fences, within a limited time,
with good hawthorn sets; to make ditches of certain dimensions;
and otherwise to improve and properly manage the respective
parcels demised to them.&nbsp; The leases originally granted
produced a yearly income of &pound;91. 7s.; but a considerable
income may reasonably be looked for on the falling of leases,
determinable on three lives, the lands being valued at upwards of
&pound;3 per acre, which would produce an annual rental of about
&pound;350.&nbsp; The income is subject to a charge for land-tax
of &pound;6. 2s.; chief rent, &pound;1; and &pound;5. 5s. to the
collector of rents.&nbsp; In the application of their annual
rents, the trustees were in the first instance called upon to
defray the expenses attending the Act of Parliament and the
preliminary arrangements in execution of their trust, which
amounted to &pound;663. 0s. 8d.&nbsp; These expenses being
discharged, the income was next applied, for several years, to
the purpose of repairing the streets and public buildings
specified in the act; and having appropriated to those uses, from
time to time, the sum of &pound;808. 3s. 5&frac12;d., the
trustees had in hand, on the balancing of their accounts in
April, 1785, the sum of &pound;93. 8s. 7&frac12;d.&nbsp; In the
year 1787 the benefits of the trust were extended to the
establishment of a Sunday school, and in 1790 to that of a
stocking manufactory.&nbsp; This undertaking being found not to
prosper, was superseded in 1796 by the erection of a wind-mill
for grinding corn.&nbsp; This measure appears to have been loudly
called for by the inhabitants of Newport, as a means of
protecting themselves against what were deemed the extortionate
demands of the millers of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The
speculation, however, proved exceedingly ruinous, and was finally
abandoned in the year 1801; since which time the rents of the
premises have been applied, as before, to the repairs of the
streets and public buildings, as far as there has remained a
surplus, after keeping down the annual interest of the debts
which these abortive schemes have entailed upon the trust.&nbsp;
It appears that &pound;460 was expended in the attempt to
establish the manufacture of stockings, and the corn-mill cost
&pound;2,000.&nbsp; The latter, however, was subsequently sold
for &pound;900.&nbsp; Previously to the year 1799 debts had been
contracted to carry on these schemes, amounting to
&pound;2,300.&nbsp; This sum had been reduced to &pound;1,100,
when the Charity Commissioners published their report, which had
been secured by mortgage of the Marsh, at five per cent.
interest; so that there remained an annual charge of &pound;55 in
respect of the debts which remained unpaid.&nbsp; In addition to
the debts contracted for the purposes above mentioned,
&pound;192. 4s. 3d. was borrowed from the treasurer in 1811, for
the benefit of the public repairs, for which it was agreed to
allow him five per cent. interest until he should reimburse
himself from the rents.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Bridge Trust</span>.&mdash;By an
indenture, dated 5th May, 1749, purporting to be made between the
Earl of Shrewsbury and Earl Gower, lords of the manor of Newport,
<a name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 407</span>and
Robert Pigot, Esq., steward of the borough of Newport, and the
burgesses of the said borough, of the first part, and Robert
Barber, Esq., and others, of the second part, it was witnessed
that the said earls, steward, and burgesses, granted to the said
Robert Barber, and others, all those parcels of lands lying
waste, but formerly covered with water, called the Strine, or
Newport Pool, and the Flags, with the appurtenances, in trust,
that, with the rent, issues, and profits thereof, the Pool Dam,
at the lower end of the town, should be repaired and kept in good
order; and if any surplus should remain, the same should be
appropriated to keeping in good order the pavement of the
streets, or in the reparation of the Market House or Town
Hall.&nbsp; A subsequent indenture was made, dated 17th October,
1750, granting the waste lands called the Flags, and also a small
parcel of land lying near the entrance to the same, rendering the
annual rent of 5s.&nbsp; The premises conveyed in these
indentures were found by a survey, made in 1804, to contain
2<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>.
21<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, which produced an annual
rental of &pound;18.&nbsp; The rent, after deducting the 5s.
reserved to the burgesses, and certain incidental expenses,
appears to have hitherto been confined to the repair of the
Bridge and Bridge-street; which not having exhausted the whole,
the surplus has been deposited, from time to time, in the Newport
Bank.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>The Rev. Thomas
Perkes</i>, by will, dated 26th March, 1734, gave (after the
death of his wife, Hannah) to the minister and churchwardens of
the parish of Newport, and their successors, the sum of
&pound;200, to be laid out in lands, and the profits thereof
(except the sum of 20s. to be paid to the minister, as a
recompense for disposing of the charity) to be expended in
purchasing Holy Bibles, Books of Common Prayer, and books
intitled The Whole Duty of Man, to be yearly distributed among
the poorer sort of inhabitants of Newport; and when such poor
people should, in the judgment of the minister, be sufficiently
supplied with such books, then the yearly rent should be laid out
in clothing old people residing in and being parishioners of the
town of Newport.&nbsp; A preference to be given to those that
should be of the most religious and orderly life.</p>
<p><i>Hannah Perkes</i>, wife of the above Mr. Perkes, who
appears to have died in 1766, bequeathed &pound;600, to be put
upon land or other good security, to the intent that the interest
should be duly applied towards the setting out three poor boys,
of the parish of Newport, apprentices in some place of
manufacture, to be elected annually by the minister,
church-wardens, head-schoolmaster, together with five men
nominated by the parish yearly,&mdash;especial regard being had
that the boys so chosen should be able to read the English tongue
well.&nbsp; She likewise left &pound;100, to be laid out in land,
or some other good security, the interest to be distributed
amongst the poorest inhabitants of the parish, upon St.
Thomas&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; These several legacies, amounting
together to the sum of &pound;900, were laid out in the purchase
of &pound;996. 1s. 9d. three per cent. reduced annuities,
producing annual dividends amounting to &pound;29. 17s.;
two-ninths of which are annually paid to the minister on account
of Mr. Perkes&rsquo;s charity, and on account of Mrs.
Perkes&rsquo;s charity six-ninths are annually applied on
apprentice fees, and one-ninth is expended in bread for the
poor.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Mary Scott</i> bequeathed &pound;100, and desired the
minister and two masters of the free-school, whom she constituted
trustees, to dispose of the yearly produce in the relief of poor
housekeepers of this parish, except that every fourth year they
should lay out the income in Bibles, Common Prayer Books, and The
Whole Duty of Man, which should be distributed among poor
children whose parents should not be able to provide them.&nbsp;
This gift, and a further legacy of &pound;20, the gift of <i>Mrs.
Felicia Vyse</i>, was laid out on the 8th of March, 1786, in the
purchase of a plot of land, situated at Chetwynd End, called the
Four-day Math, and containing 3<span class="smcap">a</span>.
0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 36<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
which land was conveyed to the then minister and two masters of
the grammar school, on trust, to apply five-sixths of the rents
to the charitable uses appointed by Mrs. Scott, and to pay the
remaining sixth among the poor of the parish.&nbsp; The land
produces an annual rental of &pound;13. 17s.&nbsp; The rent is
received by the minister, as one of the trustees; but in the
application of it the trusts do not appear to have been duly kept
in view, the rent having been paid to the churchwardens for <a
name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 408</span>general
distribution among the poor, without reserving any portion for
the purchase of books, as directed by the will of Mrs. Scott.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dole Charities</span>.&mdash;By an
indenture, dated the 23rd of March, 1675, certain lands, situated
at Little Aston, called the Foxhall lands, were conveyed for the
sum of &pound;220 to William Harding, one of the churchwardens of
the parish, for charitable uses, subject to a yearly rent of 3s.
6d. to Thomas Talbot, the lord of the manor.&nbsp; It does not
appear from what source the consideration money of this purchase
was derived, but it is probable that it arose from a stock of
&pound;161, recorded in an inquisition as having been given by
several donors, and the additional sum might be the subsequent
accumulations of interest upon it.&nbsp; The premises consist of
a cottage and garden, and three closes; containing in the whole
about 13 acres of land.&nbsp; They were let under a lease of 14
years at Lady-day, 1814, at the annual rent of &pound;82.&nbsp;
It appears Mr. Leek was induced by particular circumstances to
offer the above mentioned rent, though far exceeding the fair
value of the premises.</p>
<p><i>Robert Hawkins</i>, on the 15th December, 1660, charged a
certain house in Newport, with the payment of 13s. 4d. per annum,
and directed the same to be distributed to the poor.</p>
<p><i>William Adams</i>; who died in 1690, gave a rent charge of
26s. per annum, payable out of his lands and tenements in
Newport, and directed the same to be expended in bread, and given
to the aged poor in sixpenny loaves for ever, according to the
discretion of the minister, churchwardens, and overseers of the
town.&nbsp; This charity is understood to be comprised in a
weekly supply of twelve penny loaves which has been for many
years made for the use of the poor, by the late Richard Marsh,
Esq., as owner of certain lands, at Norbroom.&nbsp; There does
not, however, appear any mention of such a charge in the title
deeds, nor was Mr. Marsh able to give any information as to the
origin of the weekly supply, which, having been made before his
time, he had felt it proper to continue.&nbsp; There is no
charity to which the residue of this weekly supply might with any
likelihood be ascribed, except that of <i>Thomas Sprig</i>, who
is recorded on the benefaction table to have left six penny
loaves, to be given to the poor every Lord&rsquo;s-day, and
twelve every Sacrament-day.</p>
<p><i>Richard Haynes</i>, in 1713, left to the poor of this
parish six penny loaves to be given every Lord&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp;
This benefaction appears to have been charged upon a parcel of
land which became the property of Mrs. Humpherson some time ago,
by whom a weekly supply of six penny loaves was duly made.&nbsp;
In 1713 Stephen Denston left &pound;100 to the poor; and we also
learn from the churchwarden&rsquo;s book of donations that
Richard Fletcher, in 1721, left &pound;30 to the poor, and that
Mrs. Moreton by her will bequeathed &pound;20, the interest to be
distributed in bread.&nbsp; These several sums, amounting
together to &pound;150, were invested on the 2nd April, 1770, on
a mortgage of the tolls of the Forton and Lilleshall turnpike,
producing at five per cent. interest the annual sum of &pound;7.
10s.&nbsp; It is also stated in the churchwarden&rsquo;s book
that Felicia Vyse, who died in 1747, gave by her will &pound;20,
the interest to be given yearly to the poor of the parish.&nbsp;
We have already shown that this legacy, in conjunction with Mrs.
Mary Scott&rsquo;s, was applied in the purchase of the Four Math
Meadow.&nbsp; The whole rents having been paid over to the
churchwardens for the same common purpose, no severance has taken
place in the application.</p>
<p><i>Abraham Hadderton</i>, by will, dated 9th September, 1770,
gave to the minister, churchwardens, and overseers of the poor,
and their successors, &pound;1,000 in trust, to keep the same at
interest, and apply the proceeds thereof for the benefit of the
poor.&nbsp; This legacy was invested in the purchase of
&pound;1,141. 8s. 6d. three per cent. reduced annuities,
producing the annual dividends of &pound;34. 5s. 6d.</p>
<p><i>William Brown</i> gave a rent charge of 10s. yearly,
payable out of a certain house in Newport, which became the
property of William Crump in 1820.&nbsp; The Dole charities above
specified produce an annual sum of &pound;156. 6s. 2d., and are
administered by the <a name="page409"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 409</span>churchwardens.&nbsp; &pound;15. 7s.
8d. is expended in bread, and distributed at different periods,
and the residue, &pound;140. 12s. 5d., is given in money.</p>
<p><i>Elizabeth Symonds</i> gave a certain croft, the yearly rent
thereof to be applied to the benefit of the poor of Newport for
ever.&nbsp; The croft thus given contains about an acre and a
quarter, which produces a yearly rental of &pound;7. 10s.&nbsp;
The amount is distributed in small sums among the poor not
receiving parish relief.</p>
<p><i>William Hawkins</i>, by will, 1724, gave to the poor of
this parish &pound;5 per annum, charged on certain premises, the
property of Mr. Collier.&nbsp; The amount is expended in warm
clothing, and given to the poor about Christmas.</p>
<p><i>John Hayley</i> charged a certain house with the payment of
4s. yearly, to be distributed in bread.&nbsp; It appears that
Eleanor Richards, in 1758, paid the sum of &pound;4 into the
hands of the then minister and certain other persons, trustees
for repairing the bridge, in order to exempt the house from the
annual payment of the said 4s.&nbsp; It seems reasonable to
presume that the sum thus paid to the trustees of the bridge was
applied by them to the purposes of their trust, which would
create, we apprehend, a liability on their part to pay the
annuity of 4s.&nbsp; We do not, however, find any instance of
such a payment.</p>
<p>A rent charge of &pound;5 per annum, left by John Staunton,
payable out of a tenement in Newport, has not been paid for many
years; the premises having passed to several successive owners
without any mention of the rent charge in the title deeds.&nbsp;
A yearly sum of 6s. 8d., left by Roger Simonds, has long been
lost.&nbsp; The gift of &pound;20 by Francis Wells, in 1680;
&pound;20 by Mr. Edwards, and &pound;30 by Mrs. Brayne, in 1713,
recorded on the table of benefactions, have also been lost.</p>

<h3>PRESTON-UPON-THE-WILD-MOORS</h3>
<p>is a parish and small rural village, three miles N.E. of
Wellington, comprising 1,153<span class="smcap">a</span>. 4<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 30<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
and in 1801 had 170 inhabitants; 1831, 218; and in 1841 there
were 80 houses and a population of 389 souls.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;1,422. 1s. 10d.&nbsp; The village is retired, but
pleasantly situated, and contains some good farm
residences.&nbsp; St. John Chiverton Charlton, Esq., and the
Trustees of Preston Hospital are the landowners.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span> is a small brick <a
name="page416"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 416</span>structure,
consisting of nave and chancel, with a tower, in which are two
bells.&nbsp; The living is a rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;3, now returned &pound;198, in the patronage of
the Trustees of Preston Hospital and St. John Chiverton Charlton,
Esq., alternately; incumbent, Rev. William Taylor Bird,
M.A.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for &pound;119, and there are
23 acres of glebe land.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Preston Hospital</span>.&mdash;<i>Lady
Catherine Herbert</i>, widow of Henry Lord Herbert, by her will,
bearing date 11th April, 1716, gave the sum of &pound;6,000, in
trust, to be laid out in the purchase of lands, in the county of
Salop, and building an almshouse thereon, for the reception of 12
poor women and 12 poor girls; the patronage to be vested in the
Earl and Countess of Bradford.&nbsp; <i>Thomas Lord
Torrington</i>, by will, 1718, devised his real estate in
Preston-upon-the-Wild-Moors, subject to certain annuities, in
trust, to apply the rents and profits to the same use as Lady
Herbert&rsquo;s gift; and directed the almshouse to be built upon
such part of the estate at Preston as his trustees should think
proper; and he gave &pound;1,000, then due to him from his
nephew, the Earl of Bradford, to the trustees, to be laid out in
building a hall in the middle of the hospital.&nbsp; The property
belonging the hospital, when the Charity Commissioners published
their report in the year 1828, consisted of the sum of
&pound;9,621. 4s. 6d., three per cent. consols; certain lands,
chiefly situated in the parish of Preston, comprising 1,077<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 31<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, let at a yearly rental of
&pound;1,301. 5s. 6d.; and the dividends of &pound;5,539. 12s.
three per cent. consols, producing &pound;166. 3s. 4d. per
annum.&nbsp; The latter stock is in respect of a legacy of
&pound;4,000, bequeathed in 1802 by <i>Charles Henry Coote</i>,
<i>Earl of Montrath</i>, to be applied by the trustees in the
augmentation of the poor widows&rsquo; stipends.</p>
<p>The hospital is a spacious and elegant brick structure, with
stone finishings, and was originally built so as to form three
sides of a square, with a large hall in the centre, used both as
a chapel and as a school.&nbsp; The old buildings contain
apartments for 20 widows, and sufficient accommodation for 20
girls and the matron who superintends the school, together with a
kitchen and other offices.&nbsp; There are also apartments for
the receiver, who has occasion frequently to attend on business
connected with the trust.&nbsp; Under an order of the Court of
Chancery, made 27th March, 1827, new buildings have been erected
as wings at each end.&nbsp; These comprise eight apartments, for
an additional number of widows.&nbsp; Each of the widows has for
her own use a small garden.&nbsp; There are also three meadows
and a large garden, which are kept in hand, and stocked for the
general use of&rsquo; the hospital.&nbsp; Since the erection of
the wings, the number of widows have been increased from 20 to
27.&nbsp; The widows are selected by the trustees, without any
restriction as to the place of birth or residence.&nbsp; Twenty
inmates receive &pound;26 per annum, and seven have &pound;18
a-year; in addition they have two tons of coal each, and are
provided with beds, bedding, and other necessary articles of
furniture.&nbsp; They were formerly supplied with medicine and
medical attendance from the funds of the charity; but some years
ago this expense was found to be so great that it was thought
expedient that every almswoman that should be appointed after
that time should deposit a sum of &pound;10 in a savings&rsquo;
bank, for the purpose of providing herself with such medical
assistance as she might require during her residence in the
hospital.&nbsp; When a widow dies, &pound;5 is allowed for the
expense of her funeral.&nbsp; The twenty widows who have the
largest income receive the additional allowance under the bequest
of the Earl of Montrath.&nbsp; Upon this establishment there are
also 20 girls appointed by the trustees.&nbsp; They are provided
with board and lodging, and are clothed and fed without any
expense whatever to their parents; and at 16 years of age, when
they leave the hospital, they receive &pound;5 to supply them
with clothing.&nbsp; The matron who instructs the girls, and has
the management of this branch of the establishment, as well as
the superintendence of the widows, receives a salary of &pound;30
a-year in addition to her board and lodgings.</p>

418</span>STIRCHLEY</h3>
<p>is a small parish and village five miles S. E. from
Wellington, and three miles W. from Shiffnal, which in 1801
contained 189 inhabitants; 1831, 271, and in 1841, 301; at the
latter period there were 61 houses, which are mostly scattered;
there are a number of cottages in the immediate vicinity of the
church, which are small, ill ventilated, and most miserable
hovels; this, however, is not the character of cottages generally
in this locality, or indeed in the county, for on the whole we
conceive them to be far superior to cottage residences in most
other counties.&nbsp; The parish contains 833<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 36<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, the principal owner of which is
R. H. Cheney, Esq.; the Duke of Cleveland, Robert Burton, Esq.,
and Beriah Botfield, Esq., are also proprietors.&nbsp; A
considerable part of land is held in lease by Beriah Botfield,
Esq., who has extensive collieries and ironworks in the
parish.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a small
fabric dedicated to St. Mary, and consists of nave, chancel, and
north transept, with a gallery over it built by the Botfield
family, for the use of their own workmen.&nbsp; There are ten
pews in the body of the church, and two in the chancel,&mdash;the
whole has a very primitive appearance.&nbsp; The church was
formerly lighted with small pointed windows, but these have all
been made up, and a large window void of taste and of unmeaning
character has been added to the east end to supply their
place.&nbsp; The chancel is divided from the nave by a Saxon arch
of exquisite workmanship, which modern renovators have attempted
to improve by adding sundry coats of lime wash.&nbsp; A neat
marble tablet has been erected in memory of Thomas Botfield,
Esq., who died in 1801, and of his wife, Margaret, who died in
1803.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;6. 5s. 10d., now returned at &pound;274, in the
patronage of the Phillips family, and enjoyed by the Rev. Hugo
Moreton Phillips, M.A., who resides at the rectory, situated near
the church, and has 45<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span

supported by B. Botfield, Esq., and the rector.&nbsp; There is a

bounds of Dawley Magna township.&nbsp; The Shropshire union canal
intersects this parish.&nbsp; Gross estimated rental of the
parish, &pound;2,500. 15s. 6d.; rateable value, &pound;2,364. 8s.
6d.&nbsp; Stirchley Hall is a good residence a little west from
the church.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Clowes</i>, in 1748, gave to the poor of this parish
the sum of &pound;20 per annum, to be disposed at the discretion
of the churchwarden and overseer.&nbsp; This annuity has long
been paid by the tenant of Stirchley Hall estate, formerly the
property of Mr. Clowes, and which he charged with the payment of
the same.</p>
<p><i>Richard Cookes</i>, in 1799, demised certain premises in
Stirchley for the term of 1,000 years, at the yearly rent of
17s., payable to the lessor, his heirs and assigns.&nbsp; This
rent has for a great many years been paid to the overseers of
this parish for the use of the poor, and it is supposed to have
been assigned for their benefit by Richard Cookes, the lessor,
but at what time or under what circumstances they first became
entitled to it there is no evidence to show.&nbsp; The term is at
present invested in Mr. Darral, who has improved the premises by
building to the annual value of &pound;13.</p>

&pound;937. 10s.&nbsp; The Duke of Cleveland is lord of the manor
and proprietor of the whole parish.&nbsp; The village is
delightfully situated in a salubrious country, pleasingly
beautified with rural scenery, and commands a fine view of the
majestic Wrekin.&nbsp; An avenue of trees extends nearly through
the length of the village, which gives it an air of quiet
retirement.&nbsp; There are several good houses, with pleasure
grounds neatly laid out, and tastefully planted with
shrubs.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span> has a
venerable appearance, it is built of brick and rough cast, and
dated 1678; it consists of nave and chancel, with a turret
containing two bells.&nbsp; The interior underwent a complete
reparation in 1844, at a cost of about &pound;120, raised by
subscriptions and a grant from the Diocesan and Incorporated
Societies,&mdash;the whole has now a tasteful and orderly
appearance.&nbsp; A brass plate which remembers John Stanier and
family is dated 1691.&nbsp; A neat marble tablet dated 1793 has
been erected to the memory of Rich aid Boycott, Esq.&nbsp; A
tablet very chastely designed, of coloured marble, and dated
1789, records the death of Charles Stainer and several members of
that family.&nbsp; An altar tomb to Silvanus Boycott is dated
1686.&nbsp; There is also a beautiful marble scroll, exquisitely
executed, in memory of John Middleton Ashdown, Esq., agent to the
Duke of Cleveland, which was put up at the expense of the
Duke&rsquo;s Shropshire tenantry.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual
curacy in the patronage of the Duke of Cleveland, and enjoyed by
the Rev. John Meredith, M.A.&nbsp; In the church-yard are two yew
trees of immense girth, one of which is completely hollow, and
will admit of twelve persons standing within the trunk at the
same time; although nothing remains of the trunk at the bottom
but a shell, yet the tree shows vigorous signs of life, and the
branches cover a large surface of ground.&nbsp; The tithes have
been commuted for &pound;155. 2s., when &pound;115. 2s. was
apportioned to the Duke of Cleveland, and &pound;40 to the
incumbent of the parish.</p>

<h3>UPTON MAGNA</h3>
<p>is a parish and village, pleasantly situated five miles east
from Shrewsbury and seven west from Wellington, having the
facilities of railway communication to both places, by the
Shrewsbury and Birmingham railway, which intersects the
parish.&nbsp; At the census of 1801 there were 482 inhabitants;
1831, 512; and in 1841, 99 houses and 494 souls.&nbsp; The parish

William Corbet, Esq.; the Duke of Cleveland; and Robert Burton,
Esq.; besides whom there are a few small freeholders.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. John
the Baptist, is an antique structure, consisting of nave,
chancel, and side aisles, with a tower, in which are four bells;
the body of the church is built of red sand stone, and the tower
of a white stone, which it is said was brought from an ancient
moated mansion at Hunkington; the seats and pulpit are of oak,
over the latter is the date of 1591; there is a gallery at the
west end, and an ancient stone font.&nbsp; The church has been
greatly beautified within the last ten years by the munificence
of Miss Arabella Pigott, who has added a new organ and
altar-piece, adorned the windows with stained glass, and made
other additions.&nbsp; There is a book chained to a <a
name="page420"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 420</span>desk near
the pulpit entitled, &ldquo;An answer to a certeine booke lately
set forth by Mr. Harding, entitled a confutation of the apology
of the Church of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; An altar tomb in the
chancel, with full length figures in chain armour, remembers
Waiter Barker, Esq., who died in 1644.&nbsp; There is also a
handsome marble memorial to the memory of Mary Elizabeth Pigott,
who died in 1837, and of Frances Pigott, who died in 1829,
daughters of the Rev. William Pigott, rector of Edgmond and
Chetwynd.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;12, now returned at &pound;546, in
the patronage of Andrew William Corbett, Esq., and incumbency of
the Rev. Corbet Brown.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
School</span> is situated in the church-yard; forty-three
children attend, eight of which are educated free; the school has
the liberal support and assiduous attention of Miss Pigott.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Upton Magna Cottage</span> was built about
forty years ago, and is the delightful residence of Miss Arabella
Pigott; it is tastefully furnished, the walls are decorated with
some choice paintings, and there is a good library containing
many valuable standard works.&nbsp; The pleasure grounds are very
beautifully laid out, and command fine views of the surrounding
country, and of the majestic Wrekin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Downton</span> is a small township in
Upton Magna parish, situated about a mile W. from the
church.&nbsp; Of the townships in this parish there were no
separate returns made of the population and acres at the census
of 1841, they are therefore included with Upton Magna.&nbsp;
Andrew William Corbet, Esq., is the landowner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Thomas
Blakeway</i>, in 1767, bequeathed &pound;300 upon trust to apply
one-third part of the yearly proceeds thereof in relieving the
necessities of poor housekeepers, and the residue for the
instruction of children belonging to poor parishioners.&nbsp; He
also bequeathed &pound;20 to be laid out in the repairs of the
school.&nbsp; As the produce of this bequest there is now
&pound;322 stock, three and half per cents., the dividends of
which amount to &pound;11. 5s. 4d., two thirds of which are
applied in the education of youth, and one-third is distributed
among the poor.&nbsp; The <i>Rev. Richard Andrews</i>, in 1726,
left &pound;10 to the use of the poor.&nbsp; Mrs. <i>Ann
Peploe</i>, in 1728, gave &pound;16 to buy a garment for the
poor.&nbsp; <i>Ann Barker</i> gave &pound;20, and <i>Thomas
Jewkes</i> &pound;20 for the benefit of the poor.&nbsp; These
several sums, amounting in the whole to &pound;71, were laid out
in building a parish work-house, which was subsequently sold, and
the charity money was laid out in 1813, in the purchase of
&pound;80. 0s. 7d. stock in the navy five per cents., and there
is now in respect of the charity money &pound;84. 0s. 7d.
standing in the names of certain trustees in the new four per
cents.&nbsp; Out of the dividends 5s. is given away in bread,
16s. laid out in the purchase of two garments for poor persons,
and the residue is distributed in small sums on St.
Stephen&rsquo;s-day.</p>

<h3>WELLINGTON</h3>
<p>is a considerable parish and flourishing market town,
pleasantly situated eleven miles E. from Shrewsbury, and 142 N.W.
from London, and by railway 11 miles from Shrewsbury, 7&frac12;
miles S.W. from Newport, 31 miles from Birmingham, <a
name="page422"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 422</span>and seven

6s.&nbsp; Population in 1801, 7,531; 1831, 9,671; and in 1841,
11,099.&nbsp; The township of Wellington contains 727<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 16<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land; and in 1841 had a population of
6,084 souls, of whom 3,104 were males and 2,980 females; at the
same period there were 1,181 inhabited houses, 101 uninhabited,
and 18 houses building.&nbsp; Wellington is a well-built town, of
considerable importance, and from its contiguity to the great
seat of the iron and coal works in this county, it has a much
frequented market.&nbsp; It is also the centre of a rich
agricultural district, has ample communication by railway to all
parts of the kingdom, and the Shropshire Union Canal, in its
immediate vicinity, opens a water communication with the Severn
and distant parts of the country.&nbsp; The town contains many
good houses, with shops in all the different branches of the
retail trade; there are also several good inns.&nbsp; The malting
business is extensively carried on; the establishment of Mr.
James Shepard is on a large scale.&nbsp; There are also an iron
foundry, a tannery, and several establishments for the
manufacture of nails; agricultural implements are also
made.&nbsp; Hugh Burnel, in the reign of Edward I., obtained the
grant of a market (to be held on Thursdays), and of two fairs in
the year&mdash;the first to be held on the day after the feast of
St. Barnabas, and the second on the eve, the day, and the day
after the decollation of St. John the Baptist.&nbsp; The market
is still held on the Thursday, and the fairs are held March 29th,
June 22nd, September 29th, November 17th, Monday week before
Christmas day, and the last Monday in each of the other
months.&nbsp; At these fairs large quantities of farm and dairy
produce, as also horses, horned cattle, and sheep, are usually
sold.&nbsp; The magistrates of the county hold petty sessions
monthly.&nbsp; William and Thomas Turner, Esqrs., are clerks to
the magistrates.&nbsp; A Court of Record was formerly held for
debts not exceeding &pound;20, but this has been superseded by
the New County Court Act.&nbsp; The lord of the manor holds a
Court Leet annually in November, at which officers are appointed
for the government of the town, and constables for the different
townships within this division of the hundred.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to All
Saints, a commodious and elegant structure of freestone, was
erected, <span class="GutSmall">M</span>,<span
class="GutSmall">DCCXC</span>., and consists of nave, side
aisles, and bay, with a square tower crowned with a dome, gilt
cross, and vane.&nbsp; The galleries are supported by cast-iron
pillars.&nbsp; At the west end is a handsome and fine-toned
organ, and over the bay is a glory.&nbsp; The roof is lofty, and
the whole has a very beautiful and chaste appearance.&nbsp; At
the east end of the south aisle is an elegant marble memorial,
executed by Hollins, in memory of Martha Elizabeth Oliver, who
died June 20th, aged 26 years.&nbsp; Another marble monument
remembers Richard Emery, Esq., who died April 13th, 1839, aged 65
years, and several other members of that family.&nbsp; The
interior of the church was painted, and the gas-fittings added,
in the year 1847, chiefly at the expense of the vicar and St.
John C. Charlton, Esq.; the cost was upwards of &pound;300.&nbsp;
In the tower of the church is a peal of six musical bells.&nbsp;
The church is surrounded with a large burial ground, which, with
the site of the church, contains upwards of three acres.&nbsp; It
contains numerous tombs, some of which are of elaborate
workmanship, and have been erected in memory of some of the
principal families of the parish.&nbsp; The church formerly
belonged to the abbey of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The living is a
vicarage annexed to the rectory of Eyton, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;9. 5s., in the patronage of Thomas
Eyton, Esq., and incumbency of the Rev. Benjamin Banning, M.A.,
who resides at <span class="smcap">The Vicarage</span>, a
spacious and handsome residence, about a quarter of a mile south
from the church.&nbsp; The house commands a fine <a
name="page423"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 423</span>view of the
Wrekin, and is surrounded with pleasure grounds and
shrubberies.&nbsp; In the 15th of Henry VI. the guild of the Holy
Trinity and of the Virgin Mary in the church of All Saints, in
Wellington, obtained a pardon from the king, for having acquired
twenty messuages, ten acres of heath, and six acres of meadow in
Wellington, without license.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The New Church</span> is dedicated to our
Saviour, and is pleasantly situated on elevated ground, at the
southern outskirts of the town.&nbsp; It was built by
subscription and grants from the church building societies, at a
cost of &pound;3,600.&nbsp; The structure is of white brick, with
a lofty square tower, ornamented with four crocketted
pinnacles.&nbsp; The interior consists of nave and side aisles,
with spacious galleries.&nbsp; Over the side aisles and at the
west end, upon the latter, is a small organ, erected at a cost of
&pound;170.&nbsp; On each side of the church are seven narrow
windows, in the lancet style.&nbsp; The roof is of groined
timber, and the pews are painted in imitation of oak, which gives
the whole a neat and light appearance.&nbsp; There are 1,144
sittings: of which 744 are declared free and unappropriated for
ever.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, in the patronage of
the Vicar of Wellington: incumbent, Rev. Charles Campe.&nbsp; The
church is surrounded with a spacious cemetery; and on the west
side is the Parsonage House&mdash;a neat brick structure, erected
shortly after the Church was built.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Particular Baptist Chapel</span>,
situated in King-street, is a neat brick structure, which will
accommodate about 500 hearers.&nbsp; It was built in 1828, on the
site of a former edifice, that had been erected about half a
century.&nbsp; The Rev. William Keay has been the pastor of the
congregation worshipping here for the last 30 years.&nbsp; The
Rev. Henry Gabriel Granger has recently been appointed to assist
Mr. Keay in the pastorate.&nbsp; A small burial ground adjoins
the chapel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel</span> is a
lofty brick fabric, situate in New street, and was built in
1836.&nbsp; It has galleries on three sides, and is capable of
holding five hundred worshippers.&nbsp; A small organ was added
in 1851, at a cost of &pound;80.&nbsp; The Old Methodist Chapel,
which stood in Chapel Lane, has been taken down.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Primitive Methodist Chapel</span>, situate near
the Tan Bank, was built in 1837.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Catholic Chapel</span>, a plain brick
structure, has been built about fifteen years.&nbsp; It has a
gallery at the end, and will hold about 400 persons.&nbsp; A
painting of our Saviour is placed over the altar.&nbsp; There is
no resident priest in Wellington at the present time, but the
Rev. William Molloy, of Madeley, officiates at stated
periods.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span> is a good
brick structure, situate on the Tan Bank.&nbsp; The congregation
worshipping here have no settled minister at the present
time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The National School</span> is a spacious
brick building on the north side of the churchyard.&nbsp; It is
supported by voluntary subscriptions, charity sermons, and a
small weekly charge from each scholar.&nbsp; One hundred and
sixty-eight boys, and one hundred and twenty girls attend.&nbsp;
The teacher receives &pound;4. 0s. 10d. from the receiver of the
Crown rents.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Catholic School</span>, situate at the
back of the catholic chapel, on Mill Bank, is also supported by
subscriptions and a small charge from each scholar.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Savings&rsquo; Bank</span>, situate in Walker
street, was established in 1818.&nbsp; On November 20th, 1850,
the capital stock of the bank amounted to &pound;27,623, at which
period there were 692 depositors.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Turner is the
actuary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The County Court Office</span> is situate
near the Market Hall.&nbsp; All pleas of personal action, where
the debt or damage claimed is not more than &pound;50, may be
heard and determined by the County Court.&nbsp; The jurisdiction
of the Wellington Court embraces the parishes of Bolas Magna,
Ercall Magna, Eyton, Kinnersley, Longdon, Preston, Rodington,
Waters Upton, Wellington, Wombridge, and Wrockwardine.&nbsp;
<i>Judge</i>: Uvedale Corbett, Esq., Aston Hall, near
Shiffnal.&nbsp; <i>Clerk</i>: Frederick Buckle, Esq., New street,
Wellington.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Market Hall</span> is a brick
building, stuccoed, and situated a little back from the
Market-square.&nbsp; A spacious room, measuring sixty feet by
twenty feet, is used for magisterial purposes, public meetings,
assemblies, musical concerts, &amp;c.&nbsp; Under it is an open
<a name="page424"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 424</span>area,
provided with benches, where the butter market is held.&nbsp; The
hall was built by a company of shareholders, established in 1842,
with a capital stock of &pound;5,000, of which &pound;2,000 was
raised by the shareholders, and the rest was borrowed on a
mortgage of the premises.&nbsp; The company have purchased the
tolls of the market for the sum of &pound;700 from the lord of
the manor; and they are now held on lease by Mr. John Sandals, at
a yearly rental of &pound;140.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Union House</span>, a plain brick
building, situate in Walker street, is capable of holding one
hundred and sixty inmates.&nbsp; From the report for the half
year, ending March 25, 1850, we learn that the total expenditure
was &pound;4,028. 19s. 1&frac12;d: the number of out-paupers for
that period was 2,033, and of in-door paupers 184: the average
weekly cost per head of the latter was 2s. 11d.&nbsp; The Union

Weston, and John Francis Steedman.&nbsp; <i>Relieving
Officers</i>: Edward Vickers, Ketley; and George Marcy, Watling
street.&nbsp; <i>Master and Matron</i>: Mr. and Mrs. Lewis.&nbsp;
The Old Workhouse is situated about a mile and a half south-west
from the town, and is now converted into cottages.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wellington Mechanics&rsquo;
Institute</span>, situated in New street, has been established
with the object of affording tradesmen, mechanics, and others,
opportunities of acquiring, at their leisure hours, the
principles of science and the arts, and for the cultivation of
literature.&nbsp; Persons subscribing ten shillings per annum are
entitled to all the privileges of the institution; and persons
under eighteen years of age subscribing five shillings a-year,
are deemed students of the society.&nbsp; There is a good library
of about eight hundred volumes, which have been chiefly
contributed by a few gentlemen.&nbsp; A news-room has been
established, which is furnished with some of the most popular
periodicals, and the principal London and provincial journals;
lectures are also occasionally given on interesting and useful
scientific subjects.&nbsp; There are now about seventy
members.&nbsp; The institution has the patronage and support of
the principal gentry and clergy in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Mr.
John Haynes and Mr. William M. Taylor are the honorary
secretaries.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The News-room</span>.&mdash;The news-room
was established in 1846, by a number of gentlemen and tradesmen
of the town.&nbsp; It is held at Mr. Edwards&rsquo;s, in the
Market square, and is supported by annual subscriptions of
21s.&nbsp; There is also a billiard-room for the use of the
subscribers.&nbsp; There are forty-five members.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Gas Works</span>.&mdash;The Gas Works
are situated upon the Tanbank, and were established in 1823, by
Mr. William Edwards.&nbsp; In consequence of some dispute with
reference to lighting the streets, an Act of Parliament has been
obtained during the present year (1851) for the establishment of
a joint stock company, to be called &ldquo;<i>The Wellington Coal
and Gas-light Company</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company will have a
capital of &pound;3,000, raised in three hundred shares of
&pound;10 each.&nbsp; The site chosen for the erection of the
necessary works is the garden-ground lying between the top of
Tanbank and the Wrekin road.&nbsp; Estimated cost of the works,
&pound;2,000.&nbsp; R. D. Newell, Esq., is the solicitor and
secretary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Water Works</span>.&mdash;The
Wellington Water Works were provisionally registered in 1851,
under 7 and 8 Vic. c. 110.&nbsp; The imperfect supply of water,
both as respects quantity and quality, has long been felt in the
town of Wellington; and it is to remedy this defect in the
condition of the town, as well as to afford other supplies which
local interest may require, that the company has been
established.&nbsp; It is a well ascertained fact that many of the
houses, particularly those where water is most needed, are so ill
supplied, that the occupants are obliged, throughout the year, to
procure it from a distance, at a considerable cost in both time
and money; or, in many instances, especially among the poor, to
be content with a supply totally inadequate to the ordinary
necessaries of life.&nbsp; <a name="page425"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 425</span>It is proposed to raise the
requisite supplies from the Ercall Pools, which afford every
natural facility for conveying water to any part of the town,
without materially interfering with private interests.&nbsp; The
water is free from deleterious matter, and considered excellent
for culinary and household purposes.&nbsp; It is proposed to have
a capital stock of &pound;3,000, to be raised in three hundred
ten pound shares.&nbsp; F. Buckle, Esq., is the solicitor to the
company.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The County Constabulary Office</span> is
situated in Walker street, Mr. John M&rsquo;Michael is the
superintendent, under whose directions are twelve police
constables.&nbsp; There is a small lock-up on the north-west side
of the church-yard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Horticultural Society</span> was
established in 1850, and is supported by the principal gentlemen
in the town and neighbourhood.&nbsp; The exhibitions are held in
the Market Hall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Old Hall</span>, an ancient structure
mantled with ivy, situated on the Watling street road, is the
property of Lord Forester, the lord of the manor.&nbsp; One of
the rooms is wainscotted with oak, which remains in good
preservation.&nbsp; The hall is now converted into a
boarding-school establishment, conducted by Joseph Edward
Cranage.&nbsp; A road which runs past the Old Hall leads to a few
scattered cottages and some extensive lime-works, called
Steeraway, which is about a mile and a half south from the
town.</p>
<p>It was in Wellington and the vicinity that Charles I. mustered
his forces, and, after issuing orders for the maintenance of
strict discipline, made a solemn protestation that he would
defend the established religion, govern by law, and preserve the
liberty of his subjects, and that if he conquered he would uphold
the privileges of parliament.&nbsp; It is to be lamented that he
should have found it necessary to make a protestation of his
adherence to the duties of an English monarch; had he earlier
practised them, he would have avoided the contentions between
himself and his parliament.&nbsp; The celebrated Dr. Withering,
author of the &ldquo;Botanical Arrangements of British
Plants,&rdquo; was born at Wellington, in the year 1741.&nbsp;
His father was a physician, and the family had resided during
many generations on a small patrimony in this county.&nbsp; Dr.
Withering in his early years seems to have received a good
classical education; and in the autumn of 1762 he was
matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, where he
distinguished himself by pursuing his studies with the greatest
diligence and attention.&nbsp; Whilst he was unwearied in the
pursuit of academic learning, as well as in all those branches of
knowledge which belong more immediately to the medical profession
for which he was intended, he did not neglect the cultivation of
the lighter and more elegant accomplishments.&nbsp; In the year
1766, Dr. Withering finished his academical studies with great
credit to himself, and obtained the degree of Doctor of
Physic.&nbsp; He first settled at Stafford, and here he attended
the accomplished lady who became the partner of his future life;
and it is not improbable that this attachment produced that
botanical turn which has since rendered his name so conspicuous
in this department of science.&nbsp; She drew beautifully; and he
appears to have gathered wild plants as subjects for her
pencil.&nbsp; This soon became a favourite pursuit; and
possessing at this time a good deal of leisure, he collected
specimens for that herbarium which he afterwards rendered so
complete.&nbsp; Dr. Withering removed to Birmingham in the year
1775, and notwithstanding the time he continued to devote to
chemistry and botany, he soon realised &pound;1,000 per annum by
his professional labours.&nbsp; During the following summer he
presented the public with the first edition of his English
Botany, a work which claims the attention of every botanical
student; and is, perhaps, exceeded by none for the facility it
offers to the inquirer, and for the copiousness and correctness
of its selection.&nbsp; His philosophical attention extended to
chemistry, mineralogy, and every branch of natural philosophy
connected with his profession occupied him in succession.&nbsp;
In the year 1791, in the month of July, he and his family
suffered much alarm and some injury in the riot at
Birmingham.&nbsp; He died in 1799.&nbsp; Before his death, he
directed no ostentatious display to be made at his funeral, and
ordered his body <a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
426</span>to be carried to church by six honest peasants.&nbsp;
Dr. Withering, besides his Botanical Arrangement of British
Plants, gave to the world several medical works.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wrekin</span>, situated about two
miles S. from Wellington, is said to be the highest hill in
Europe for the circumference of its base.&nbsp; This proud
monarch of the plain rises to the altitude of 1,320 feet, and
being in the heart of Shropshire forms a conspicuous feature in
the landscape from all parts of the surrounding country.&nbsp;
The distance is about a mile from the London road to the summit
of the hill; about half way up the ascent is a neat cottage,
where numerous parties, after luxuriating in the enjoyment of
prospects of unparalleled magnificence, assemble for social
repast.&nbsp; This huge mountain is covered with thriving
plantations, but the trees as they gradually ascend towards the
summit appear of more stunted growth.&nbsp; From the cottage a
broad pathway covered with rich verdure leads to the summit, from
which seventeen counties can be seen; in every direction the most
extensive, varied, and magnificent prospects open to view.&nbsp;
The Wrekin is regarded by the residents in Shropshire as the
centre towards which the best wishes and affections of the heart
converge in that well known convivial sentiment, unchanged by
time and never out of place, &ldquo;<i>All Friends Round the
Wrekin</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. Richard Corfield thus
beautifully describes the scenery around the lofty
mount:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The summit gained, the weary toil&rsquo;s
repaid,<br />
By prospects varied&mdash;mountain, wood, and glade;<br />
O&rsquo;er Salop&rsquo;s plains with beauteous verdure drest,<br
/>
The Cambrian mountains stretch along the west.<br />
Turn to the north and Hawkstone&rsquo;s hill you see,<br />
With Cheshire prospects reaching to the Dee;<br />
When to the east you lend th&rsquo; admiring gaze,<br />
The barren Peak your startled thoughts amaze;<br />
More eastward still you ken in distant view<br />
Edge Hill, where Charles his faithful followers drew.<br />
This fairy circle let us onward trace<br />
O&rsquo;er Brecon&rsquo;s beacons, Radnor&rsquo;s forest
chase,<br />
And as the outline may be further known,<br />
So past its limits may our love be shown&mdash;<br />
Love to our country and to all held dear<br />
By ties of kindred, friendship&rsquo;s off&rsquo;ring
bear&mdash;<br />
Love to our country, and <i>to all friends round</i><br />
<i>The Wrekin&rsquo;s</i> circle may our love resound&mdash;<br
/>
Such wishes these all Shropshire hearts inspire,<br />
In social converse round the winter&rsquo;s fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Watling Street</span> is a populous hamlet
forming the eastern suburb to the town of Wellington, from which
it is distant about half a mile.&nbsp; It is called Watling
street from being situated on the great Pr&oelig;torian highway
of the Romans, which enters this county at Boningale, and
terminates in the county of Cardigan.&nbsp; It is now the
Shrewsbury and Birmingham highway, and before the establishment
of railways was a road of immense traffic.&nbsp; There are
several respectable houses and a good inn and posting
house.&nbsp; The names of the principal residents will be found
incorporated in the Wellington directory.&nbsp; At the census of
1841 there were 66 houses and 299 inhabitants.&nbsp; Acres,
1,096<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>.
31<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land.&nbsp; Rateable value,
2,194. 4s.&nbsp; The rectoral tithes are commuted for &pound;125.
3s., and the vicarial for &pound;29. 5s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Almshouses</span>.&mdash;There are on the north
side of the church-yard six small tenements erected at the
expense of the parish about the year 1790, in lieu of some
almshouses in the old church-yard which were then pulled
down.&nbsp; The old almshouses appear to have had no endowment,
and were occupied by parish paupers, and the present <a
name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 427</span>are
occupied in the same manner, the inmates being selected by the
vicar and church-wardens.&nbsp; Three of the inmates have 1s. 6d.
per week, and the other three receive 2s. weekly.&nbsp; There are
also four or five small tenements called almshouses opposite the
pound, supposed to have been built about a century ago by a
person of the name of Ick, or some person related to that
family.&nbsp; There is no endowment to them, and the persons
residing in them when the charity commissioners published their
report claimed them as their own.</p>
<p><i>Richard Stevington</i>, by will, bearing date 23rd March,
1658, devised a rent charge of &pound;10 per annum to certain
trustees for the use of the poor of the parish of Wellington, to
be paid out of certain land called the Bury Yards.&nbsp; These
lands are situate near the town of Wellington, and consist of two
fields, one of which was sold by Lord Forester about thirty years
ago.&nbsp; The other is still held by his lordship, and his agent
pays the sum of &pound;10 annually, which is laid out in cloth
coats for poor men, and warm gowns for poor women.</p>
<p><i>Paviour&rsquo;s Charity</i>.&mdash;The yearly sum of
&pound;4 is paid by the agent of the Marquis of Cleveland, the
owner of lands in Garmson, in the parish of Leighton; and in the
churchwardens book there is entered a copy of a receipt, given
29th March, 1772, to John Newport, Esq., for the like sum as one
year&rsquo;s annuity, due at Lady-day then last, to the honest
poor of the parish of Wellington.&nbsp; This is paid yearly to
the churchwardens, and distributed on Easter Monday in sixpences
among the aged poor of the parish.&nbsp; We have not been able to
obtain any account of the origin of this charity.</p>
<p><i>Phillip&rsquo;s Charity</i>.&mdash;The only account of the
origin of this charity we have met with is a statement in the
charity book of the parish of Great Ness, from which it appears
that William Phillips gave 20s. yearly to this parish, payable
out of the same estate as was charged with the payment of 5s.
yearly to the poor of Great Ness.&nbsp; The payment is charged
upon a copyhold estate in the parish of Wem, belonging to Mr.
Nunnerley and others.&nbsp; The amount is distributed in small
sums on Good Friday.</p>

in early times the manor house of the Charltons, Lords of Powis,
of which family the first we find mentioned is John de Charlton,
who, in the first year of Edward II., obtained a charter of free

same reign procured a licence to make a castle of his manor house
here.&nbsp; The old castle was moated, part of which still

The labouring population find employment in the extensive iron
works and collieries in the immediate vicinity, and trade is
facilitated by the Shropshire union railway, which intersects the
township, and also by the Shropshire union canal, which crosses
Hadley Park a short distance from the hall.&nbsp; The opposition
between the Shrewsbury and Birmingham and the Shropshire Union
railways, has caused a greater reduction in the fares for the
last twelve months, in this locality, perhaps than in any other
part of the kingdom; the charge being but one penny for
third-class passengers to Shrewsbury, a distance of about a dozen
miles; and threepence for second-class passengers.&nbsp; The
Hadley station is situated a short distance from the Hall.&nbsp;

Ketley Company (Messrs. Lawley, Ogle, Williams, Hombersley, Cope
and Cope) have an extensive establishment for the manufacture of
pig and bar iron, and are also the proprietors of extensive

Sutherland.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>,
dedicated to St. Mary, a neat cruciform structure, exhibiting the
lancet style of architecture, was built and endowed in 1838, by
his grace George Granville, Duke of Sutherland.&nbsp; Upon the
organ is an inscription, from which we learn that the inhabitants
of Ketley and the neighbourhood, &ldquo;under a deep sense of
gratitude, have caused the organ to be erected as a thank
offering to Almighty God, for having thus disposed the heart of
his servant.&rdquo;&nbsp; The situation of the church is
judiciously chosen, elevated and central, and the churchyard
commands most extensive views of the surrounding counties.&nbsp;
The home views embrace a fine extent of the fertile plains of
Shropshire, the celebrated Wrekin, and the far-famed iron works
of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, in
the diocese of Lichfield, and patronage of the Duke of
Sutherland; incumbent, Rev. Thompson Stoneham, M.A., who resides

&pound;1,694. 12s.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span> is
a plain structure, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, consisting
of nave and chancel, with a tower in which are two bells.&nbsp;
The chancel, which is the most ancient part of the building, is
of stone, and the body of the church of brick.&nbsp; The interior
has a neglected appearance.&nbsp; Upon a stone in the nave, there
is a brass plate, with the figure of a person in priestly
habiliments, with the following inscription in old English
characters:&mdash;&ldquo;Here lieth buried Mr. Adam Graffton, the
most worshipful priest living in his days, sometime chaplain to
the famous princes, King Edward V. and Prince Arthur; Archdeacon
of Stafford, Warden of the Battlefield, Dean of St. Mary&rsquo;s
College, in Salop, and parson of this church: deceased the 20th
of June, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> one thousand five
hundred and thirty, whose soul God keep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another
brass plate, with the figure of a man and a woman and seven
children, remembers John de Onley and family, and is dated
1500.&nbsp; There are neat marble tablets to the memory of Peter
Blakeway, who died in 1808; to Elizabeth Browne, who died in
1788; and to the Rev. Corbet Browne, rector of this parish and
Upton Magna, who died in the year 1807, aged 80 years.&nbsp; The
living is a perpetual curacy, subordinate to the rectory of Upton
Magna.&nbsp; The Rev. Corbet Browne is the incumbent: Rev. Thomas
Honeyman, curate.&nbsp; This township is intersected by the
Shrewsbury Canal.&nbsp; A sum of &pound;16 mentioned in the
charity returns of 1786, as given by Andrew Peplow in 1728,
appears to have been lost many years ago, by the insolvency of
the person in whose hands it was placed.</p>

<h4>WOMBRIDGE,</h4>
<p>a parish and small village two miles east from Wellington,
containing most of the populous district of Oakengates within its
bounds.&nbsp; The parish contains 790 acres, and in 1801 had 1835
inhabitants, 1831, 1855, and in 1841 there were 406 houses and a
population of 2057 souls.&nbsp; Rateable value
&pound;2,395.&nbsp; The village is situated at the junction of
the Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and Marquis of Stafford&rsquo;s
Canals, <a name="page441"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
441</span>and intersected by the Watling street and the various
railways connected with the extensive coal and iron works in the
immediate vicinity.&nbsp; There are some slight remains in the
garden of Mr. Shepherd of a <span class="smcap">Priory</span>
that was founded here by William Fitz-Alan, for canons of the
order of St. Austin.&nbsp; It was endowed by Henry II. with the
church of St. Sutton; Hugh, Bishop of Coventry, confirmed the
grant of Sutton, together with the grant of the chapel at
Uppington, the gift of Roger de Mussun, on condition that the
canons should present their chaplains to the bishop and his
successors to receive at his and their hands, institution and
induction for that church and chapel.&nbsp; The canons were to
allow their chaplains a competent maintenance, and the residue of
the profits was to be employed in charitable uses.&nbsp; There
were various other benefactors to this priory, among whom were
the lords of Cherrington, who gave the revenues of certain lands
in that township to it.&nbsp; The various possessions of those
canons with divers liberties granted by their several
benefactors, were confirmed by King Edward II.&nbsp; The revenues
at the general dissolution of religious houses were valued at
&pound;65. 7s. 4d.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Church</span> is
a brick structure, dedicated to St. Mary and St. Leonard, and
consists of nave and transepts, with a short tower.&nbsp; It was
enlarged and galleries added in 1823, when upwards of 300
sittings were thereby obtained, of which 295 were declared free
and unappropriated, and are in addition to 100 free sittings
formerly provided.&nbsp; There is a small organ at the west
end.&nbsp; This church stands on the site of a former structure,
which was blown down by a storm which happened in the spring of
the year 1756.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, returned
at &pound;86.&nbsp; The Rev. John Dawson is the officiating
minister.</p>
<h4>OAKENGATES</h4>
<p>is a populous district, partly in Wombridge and partly in
Ketley, three miles east from Wellington, and four miles
north-west from Shiffnal.&nbsp; The inhabitants of this populous
locality find employment in the extensive collieries and iron
works with which the neighbourhood abounds.&nbsp; The town
consists of one long street which contains many good shops and
several respectable inns.&nbsp; A market was established here in
1826, which is held on Saturdays, and the after part of the day
has a very animated and business-like appearance.&nbsp; Fairs are
also held in March, June, September, and December, but the
specific days have not been finally settled.&nbsp; The fairs are
toll free.&nbsp; To the west of Market street is Ketley or
Coalpit Bank, a scattered district with a considerable
population, partly in Wombridge parish, but chiefly in Wellington
parish.&nbsp; The inhabitants have the advantage of railway
communication by the Shropshire Union Railway, which passes
through the town, and has a station within a hundred yards of
Market street.&nbsp; The extensive iron works of the Lilleshall
company will be transferred from Oakengates to Prior&rsquo;s Lee
before the expiration of the present year, in consequence of that
place being nearer the iron-stone mines, but the extensive
collieries will be carried on as heretofore by that
company.&nbsp; The coal got here is of a very superior quality,
and immense quantities are conveyed to distant parts by the
railway and canals in the vicinity.&nbsp; The extensive iron
works of Messrs. S. Horton, Simms and Bull, at Oakengates, are
just within the bounds of the parish of Shiffnal.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Independents</span> have a commodious chapel at
Oakengates; the congregation is under the pastoral care of the
Rev. H. Ollerenshaw.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Primitive
Methodists</span> have a spacious chapel built in 1847.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The National School</span> was chiefly built
at the expense of James Oliver, Esq., of Wellington, aided by a
grant from the National Society.&nbsp; Mr. Oliver also purchased
the site for the school.&nbsp; It is a neat structure of brick,
erected in 1846, comprising two commodious rooms and a residence
for the teacher.&nbsp; The average number of scholars at the
present time is fifty girls and eighty boys.</p>

<h3>WOODCOTE</h3>
<p>is a township and chapelry in the parish of Sheriff Hales,
three miles south-east by south from Newport, which in 1801
contained 130 inhabitants; 1831, 195; and in 1841 there were 29
houses and a population of 140 souls.&nbsp; The township contains
upwards of 1,000 acres of land; rateable value, &pound;1,003.
10s.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Woodcote Hall</span> is a spacious
and handsome mansion, of free stone, delightfully situated on a
gentle acclivity, and surrounded with park-like grounds finely
timbered and richly diversified with sylvan beauty.&nbsp; A
little west from the hall are extensive gardens.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Hall</span> is the seat of John Cotes, Esq.,
who is owner of the whole township.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Chapel</span>, situated near to the hall, is a plain structure of
free-stone of considerable antiquity.&nbsp; On the south side is
a door which exhibits the Saxon style of architecture.&nbsp; It
contains several neat tablets in memory of the Cotes family, the
last of which is in memory of John Cotes, <a
name="page443"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 443</span>Esq., M.P.
for the county of Shropshire, who died in 1821, aged 72 years,
leaving two sons and six daughters.&nbsp; A large marble slab,
reared up against the pews near the altar rails, appears to have
been the top of an altar tomb.&nbsp; It is curiously ornamented
with two full length figures, and has a mutilated inscription
round the edge.&nbsp; We did not observe any date upon it, but it
is very ancient and worthy of inspection.&nbsp; A little west
from the hall is an eminence called Heath Hill, which commands an
extended view over this and the adjacent county of Stafford, and
also of the towering heights of the Welsh mountains.&nbsp; On the
eastern side of the township a small stream called Moreton Brook
divides this county from that of Staffordshire; on the banks of
which is a dilapidated corn-mill.&nbsp; The rest of the parish of
Sheriff Hales, except Lilleshall House and a few scattered farms,
are within the bounds of the county of Stafford, and may at a
future period be included in a similar volume for that
county.&nbsp; The village of Sheriff Hales is pleasantly situated
three miles north from Shiffnal and five miles south from
Newport.&nbsp; The parish contains 5,317<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">a</span>. 37<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and at the census of 1841 there
were 32 houses and 191 inhabitants returned as in the county of
Shropshire, the names of the principal residents of which have
been given in the Lilleshall directory.</p>
<p>The following are the principal residents in Woodcote
township, viz.:&mdash;John Cotes, Esq., Woodcote Hall; George
Alsop, farmer, Lynn; John Bedford, farm bailiff; John Downes,
gamekeeper; James Lockley, farmer, Pave lane; Richard Lascombe,
butler, The Hall; John Morris, farmer, Lynn; Cornelius
Whitehouse, gardener, The Hall.</p>
<h3>WROCKWARDINE</h3>
<p>is a considerable parish in the Wellington division of the
South Bradford hundred, which comprises the several townships
(for highway purposes) of Admaston, Allscott, Bratton, Burcott,
Charlton, Clotley, Long Lane, Wrockwardine, and Wrockwardine
Wood.&nbsp; The parish contains 4,630<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 12<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, of which 469<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 28<span
class="smcap">p</span>. are woods, plantations, roads, and
waste.&nbsp; The soil is various, the arable lands produce good
crops of grain, and the grazing lands an abundance of
grass.&nbsp; Gross estimated rental, &pound;11,727, 7s. 4d.;
rateable value, &pound;10,554. 15s.&nbsp; In 1801 there were
1,913 inhabitants; 1831, 2,528, and in 1841, 541 houses and 2,741
inhabitants.&nbsp; A court leet and baron is held for the
manor.&nbsp; Mrs. Mary Cludde, of Orleton, is lady of the manor,
but Miss Anne Maria Cludde, daughter of the late Mr. Cludde, took
the estate as heiress on September 9th, 1851.&nbsp; Wrockwardine
township is pleasantly situated in a rich country pleasingly
diversified with undulations, and contains 1,094<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 20<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and in 1841 had 258
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;2,464. 14s.&nbsp; The
village stands on elevated ground, and commands some fine views
of open landscape scenery, of the hilly country in the Condover
hundred, and of the Wrekin.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Church</span> is an ancient structure of red sand stone,
dedicated to St. Peter, with a tower rising from the centre, in
which are six musical bells; the tower is supported by four
pointed arches rising from fluted pillars.&nbsp; It is neatly
pewed, and the pulpit and reading desk are of beautiful carved
oak.&nbsp; The organ was erected in 1846, at a cost of about
&pound;200 raised by subscriptions.&nbsp; The east window is
beautified with stained glass, and contains a representation of
our Saviour, very chastely executed.&nbsp; In the chancel are
several handsome monumental tablets, one of which remembers
Edward Pemberton and his wife, dated 1800, and is very
beautifully executed in the Grinshill free stone.&nbsp; Another
of the same stone has been erected to the memory of Edward
Cludde, Esq., and is dated 1785.&nbsp; There are also very
beautiful tablets to other members of this family, and to the
Cockburns, Phillips, Roe, and others.&nbsp; The living is a
vicarage valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;7. 8s. 6d.,
now returned at &pound;427 in the patronage of the Lord
Chancellor, and incumbency of the Rev. George L. Yate, M.A.&nbsp;
The vicarage is a good residence a short distance from the
church.&nbsp; The vicarial tithes are commuted for &pound;353.
19s., and the rectoral for &pound;225.&nbsp; It appears from the
parish register that the Houlston family have held the office of
parish clerk for a period of 257 years, and is still held by the
same family.</p>
<p><a name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 444</span><span
class="smcap">Wrockwardine Hall</span> is a commodious mansion of
brick stuccoed, beautified with pleasure grounds and
shrubberries, and is the seat of Miss Anne Maria Cludde.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Orleton Hall</span>, a delightfully situated
mansion, the seat of the ancient and highly respected family of
Cludde, is now the residence of Mrs. Cludde; the hall is
stuccoed, and the gardens and pleasure grounds are very
extensive, and kept in the most admirable order.&nbsp; It
commands a fine view of the Wrekin, and is surrounded by a park
of 160 acres, beautifully wooded.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Boys&rsquo; School</span>, a substantial brick building, was
built at the cost of Mrs. Cludde, who is also a munificent
contributor towards its support; 75 children attend.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Girls&rsquo; School</span> has an attendance of
sixty children, and is supported by Miss Cludde.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Two Almshouses</span> were erected in 1841,
&ldquo;and endowed for the maintenance of two poor women in their
declining years; they are dedicated to the memory of Edward
Cludde, Esq., late of Orleton, in this parish, by his tenants and
neighbours, in testimony of their respect for a man who was an
eminent example of pure and undefiled religion, visiting the
fatherless and widows in their affliction, and keeping himself
unspotted from the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Edward
Pemberton</i>, in 1680, devised a rent charge of &pound;3 per
annum for putting forth an apprentice every other year,
fatherless or motherless children to be always preferred.&nbsp;
The amount is charged upon an estate now the property of Mrs.
Cludde.&nbsp; A yearly sum of 10s. is paid as charged upon the
Burcot estate, and a like sum as charged upon the Leaton
property; in respect of 10s. payable by Mrs. Cludde, two bushels
of wheat flour are given away by her agent to the poor.&nbsp; The
other sum is laid out in the purchase of bread.&nbsp; It is
supposed these charities were left by one of the Langley
family.</p>
<p>Several sums of money given for charitable uses, amounting in
the whole to &pound;60, were laid out in the purchase of a piece
of land called Tidicross Furlong, which was improved in 1670 by
Edward Pemberton, who built a house and barn thereon.&nbsp; About
the year 1801 a parish workhouse was built on these premises, and
the old house and barn was pulled down.&nbsp; Up to the year 1829
the sum of &pound;4. 10s. per annum (which was the amount of the
rent when the workhouse was built) was paid out of the
poor&rsquo;s rate, and given away on Good Friday.&nbsp; In
consequence of a suggestion of the charity commissioners that the
rent ought to be raised, it was resolved at a vestry meeting of
the parish, held 5th May, 1830, that the sum of &pound;8 should
in future be paid by the parish annually for the lands above
mentioned.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Ore</i>, in 1798, gave a yearly sum of 40s., payable
out of his freehold estate in the township of Walcott, in the
parish of Wellington, the same to be given among the poor every
St. Thomas&rsquo;s-day, in his seat of the south aisle of the
church, at Wrockwardine, after morning prayer.&nbsp; <i>The Rev.
Joshua Gilpin</i>, who died in 1828, bequeathed &pound;50 to the
vicar of Wrockwardine, in trust, to divide the interest in equal
portions among eight of the poorest families residing in
Wrockwardine, on the day before Christmas day.</p>

<p>is a township and delightfully situated village in the parish
of Wrockwardine, one and a half mile north-west by north from
Wellington.&nbsp; The township contains 509<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 19<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and in 1841 here were 188
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;1,164. 13s.&nbsp; The
principal landowners are Mr. Jones; Mrs. Webb; Mr. William
Taylor; James Oliver, Esq.; Mr. John Haynes; Mrs. Elizabeth
Mansell; William Wyley, Esq.; Mrs. Austin; Mr. Waring; Mr.
Richard Tew; Mr. John Burgiss; and Mrs. Mary Williams.&nbsp; The
village of Admaston is pleasantly situated near the station on
the line of the Shrewsbury and Wellington railway, and is crossed
by beautiful drives and fine open roads, commanding most
delightful views over a luxuriant country, finely timbered, and
studded with beautiful residences.&nbsp; It is also within a few
miles of the far-famed Salopian mountain, the Wrekin, which
commands views of unparalleled extent and sublimity.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Admaston Spa</span> lies in a sheltered
situation, near the verge of the village, the waters of which
have long been celebrated for their medicinal purposes, and are
highly recommended by eminent physicians.&nbsp; There are two
wells, one of which is sulphurous, and the other chalybeate; the
upper well contains a large portion of muriate of soda, or common
salt, and a portion of muriate of lime, and is found exceedingly
beneficial in giving a salutary stimulus to the stomach,
correcting dyspepsia, and highly efficacious in scrofulous
affections.&nbsp; The lower spring contains a large quantity of
chloride sodium, and in its analysis approaches nearer to the
Harrogate waters, so justly celebrated and efficacious in
cutaneous disorders.</p>
<p>The solid contents of an imperial wine pint weigh
seventy-seven grains of the chalybeate saline water, and the

<h3>WROXETER</h3>
<p>is a parish in the Wellington division of the South Bradford
Hundred, situated on the eastern bank of the river Severn, which
contains the townships (for highway purposes) of Donnington,
Dryton, Eyton-upon-Severn, Norton, Rushton, and Wroxeter.&nbsp;
The parish comprises 4,212 acres of land, of which 188 acres are
in woods and plantations, roads, and waste.&nbsp; Gross estimated
rental, &pound;7,131.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;6,274. 3s.
6d.&nbsp; The Duke of Cleveland is the most considerable
landowner.&nbsp; Lord Berwick and the Vicar of Wroxeter are also
owners: the former is lord of the manor <a
name="page449"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 449</span>and holds a
court leet and baron.&nbsp; There is a considerable portion of
stiff soil in the parish, which is mostly used for arable
purposes.&nbsp; A sandy soil prevails in some places; the meadows
and grazing land on the banks of the Severn have a rich
herbage.&nbsp; At the census of 1801 the parish contained 544
inhabitants; and in 1841 there were 126 houses and 636
inhabitants.&nbsp; The houses in general are composed of brick
and slated, and have a respectable appearance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Village of Wroxeter</span> is
delightfully situated on elevated ground, near the eastern banks
of the Severn, five miles and three-quarters S.E. from
Shrewsbury, commanding fine views over a rich and beautiful
country of the Wrekin, and of the hilly country in the Condover
Hundred.&nbsp; The turnpike road from Shrewsbury to Wellington,
Ironbridge, and Bridgnorth, intersects the township, and a little
north from the village the river Tern has its confluence with the
Severn.&nbsp; Wroxeter is generally supposed by our antiquaries
to be the <i>Uriconium</i>, one of the cities of the Cornavii,
the ancient inhabitants of Britain.&nbsp; This city was also
called Wreckencester, which is manifestly retained in the name of
the adjacent hill, The Wrekin, to this day; from which the word
Uriconium itself may proceed.&nbsp; Whether the town was built by
the Romans or the Britons is uncertain; but that the former
fortified it is most likely, since the river Severn hereabouts
has more fords than in any other place.&nbsp; The foundation of a
bridge is sometimes discernible at low water, which was at first
discovered by some workmen erecting a wear upon the river.&nbsp;
The circumference of the wall which surrounded the city was about
three miles, and was built upon a gravel full of pebble
stones.&nbsp; The wall was three yards broad, with a deep trench
on the outside, which may be traced in several places to this
day.&nbsp; The remains of the walls are called by the inhabitants
the Old Works at Wroxeter; being about twenty feet high and a
hundred feet in length, made of hewn stone, distinguished with
seven rows of British bricks at equal distances, and arched
within, after the manner of the Britons.&nbsp; Where these
remains appear, it is thought the citadel stood, and what favours
the opinion is the evenness of the ground, and the rubbish of
walls that lie in great heaps thereabouts.&nbsp; It is supposed
by some that the blackness of the soil in certain places proceeds
from the fire that burnt the town, but it can hardly be
conjectured that the footsteps of such a casualty should remain
so long, especially since the ground has been so often ploughed
up and exposed to the weather.&nbsp; The Roman coins found here
are a proof of the antiquity of the place.&nbsp; The lords of the
manor, from time to time, have obliged all their lease tenants,
under certain penalties, to bring all the old coins they meet
with to them.&nbsp; The coins found are generally so rusty and
decayed that the inscription is scarcely legible or the image to
be distinguished.&nbsp; None of the Saxon coins have ever been
found here, which is a proof that the place was destroyed before
the Danish times.&nbsp; It is impossible to look upon the fields,
teeming in rich luxuriance, and remembering that there flourished
a Roman city, not a vestige of which remains but the fragments of
a wall, without sensibly feeling the instability of human
greatness, and exclaiming with Cowper:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We turn to dust, and all our mightiest
works<br />
Die too.&nbsp; The deep foundations that we lay,<br />
Time ploughs them up, and not a trace remains.<br />
We build with what we call eternal rock;<br />
A distant age asks where the fabric stood?<br />
And in the dust, sifted and search&rsquo;d in vain,<br />
The undiscoverable secret sleeps,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The graves that have been met with here are deep and wide, the
corpse enclosed in red clay, both under and over, and to prevent
the mixture of other mould with that clay, the graves were faced
on the sides with slates, and then covered with stones, sometimes
five or six upon one grave; bones have been found that were
interred after this manner, <a name="page450"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 450</span>which contributed to their
preservation several hundred years.&nbsp; Teeth have been taken
out of the jaw-bones of men near three inches long, and many
thigh bones have been found of full a yard in length.&nbsp;
Several urns have been discovered within the memory of man, after
digging four or five feet deep in the earth, and it is to be
noted that as the dead bodies are here buried in red clay, so
urns are found deposited in red sand.&nbsp; About half a century
ago were discovered three large urns composed of a beautiful
transparent green glass, each having one handle elegantly ribbed,
and severally containing burnt bones, and a glass
lachrymatory.&nbsp; Several earthen urns, an earthen lamp, and a
few Roman coins were also found at the same place, the whole
being covered with large flat stones.&nbsp; Tesselated pavements,
sepulchral stones with inscriptions, moulds for coining money;
seals, an Apolla elegantly cast in lead; copper, gold, and silver
coins, and many interesting remains of Roman manufacture, have
from time to time been found whilst excavating on this
site.&nbsp; A stone altar found near the vicarage in the year
1824, is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;BONO REI
PVBLICAE NATVS.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The precise epoch of the first establishment of this Roman
station at Wroxeter has been hitherto held as uncertain by all
historians, but a recent event has thrown some light on this
historical point.&nbsp; In 1844 a large brass coin of the Emperor
Trajan, in a fine state of preservation, was found imbedded in
the mortar of the Roman wall (usually called the old works) still
remaining at Wroxeter, which warrants a conclusion that although
the erection of this station might have been posterior to the
reign of Trajan, it would seem clear that this station could not
have been raised at an earlier period.&nbsp; Marcus Ulpius
Trajanus Crinitus, or Marcus Ulpius Nerva Trajanus, was born
<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 53.&nbsp; He was governor of
Germania under the Emperors Domitian and Nerva, and in the year
97 was associated with the latter in the government of the
empire, and invested with the titles of C&aelig;sar and
Imperator.&nbsp; He succeeded Nerva, and took the title of
Augustus in <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 98, and died in
the year 117.&nbsp; It may therefore reasonably be supposed, from
the perfect state and freshness of the above mentioned coin, that
the station of Uriconium was built either at the latter end of
the first or early in the second century.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is an ancient structure,
dedicated to St. Andrew, consisting of nave, chancel, and side
aisles, with a massive square tower, ornamented with a clock, and
the heads of rude figures of a grotesque character.&nbsp; The
interior is neatly pewed.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage valued
in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;11. 18s., now returned at
&pound;330, in the patronage of the Duke of Cleveland, and
enjoyed by the Rev. Edward Egremont, M.A., who resides at the
vicarage, a good residence a short distance from the
church.&nbsp; The Duke of Cleveland, Lord Berwick, and Mrs.
Jenkins, are the impropriators of the rectoral tithes, which were
commuted in 1840 for &pound;606. 6s.&nbsp; The vicarial tithes
have been commuted for &pound;248. 14s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;Thomas Alcock, who
died in 1627, gave twenty marks yearly towards the support of a
free grammar school for the instruction of youth of the parishes
of Wroxeter and Uppington.&nbsp; An addition was made to this
endowment by the will of Richard Stevinton in 1652, whereby he
gave a rent charge of &pound;13. 6s. 8d., issuing out of his
lands in Arleston, in the parish of Wellington.&nbsp; There is a
school and schoolhouse situate at Donnington, and six acres of
land adjoining thereto, but it is not known from whom this
property was derived.&nbsp; The school premises have been greatly
improved at the expense of the master, and are worth about
&pound;12 a year.&nbsp; The school has been considered as free
for classical instruction only to forty children of the
inhabitants of Wroxeter and Uppington, but there is no document
showing that the number of free scholars is thus limited; and it
is to be observed that the benefaction of Richard Stevinton was
for the use of a master who should teach English as well as
Latin.&nbsp; Scholars educated in this school are entitled to the
benefit of two of the exhibitions founded by Edward Careswell, an
account of which has already been noticed with the Royal Free
Grammar School at Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>From an entry made in the churchwarden&rsquo;s book in 1765,
it appears that the sum of <a name="page451"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 451</span>&pound;61 belonging to the poor of
Wroxeter, and which had formerly been placed out at interest, was
called in, and laid out in building and repairing the church, and
that &pound;2 was to be paid yearly as the interest
thereof.&nbsp; This has been regularly paid from the
churchwarden&rsquo;s account, but it appears to have been an
inadequate sum to be allowed as the interest of &pound;61.</p>
<p>In the same book there is an entry also made in the year 1765,
stating that &pound;20 given by <i>Edward Wellings</i>, to buy
Bibles for poor children of Wroxeter, at the discretion of the
minister was laid out for the same purpose.&nbsp; In respect of
this gift 10s. is paid annually, and laid out in the purchase of
Bibles.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Roger Clayton</i>, in 1327, invested &pound;100 in
the purchase of &pound;113. 10s. stock, three per cent. consols,
in compliance with the wish of his late brother William Clayton,
in trust, to apply the interest for the benefit of the poor of
Wroxeter.&nbsp; A memorandum was drawn up and placed in the
parish chest, dated 16th October, 1827, and signed by Roger
Clayton and Richard and Edward Stanier, acknowledging the stock
to have been purchased for the aforesaid object.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Donnington</span> is a township and
pleasant village situated a mile and a half E. from Wroxeter; the
Duke of Cleveland is the landowner and lord of the manor.&nbsp;
The population of the several townships in this parish are
included in the returns for Wroxeter.&nbsp; The Charlton Hill
corn mill is situated in this township; it was erected by the
farmers in the surrounding neighbourhood to grind their own
corn.&nbsp; The grammar school noticed with the charities of the
parish is situated at Donnington.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dryton</span>, a small township near the
banks of the river Severn, is also the property of the Duke of
Cleveland, and is situated two miles and a quarter S.S. by E.
from Wroxeter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Eyton-on-the-Severn</span>, a township two
miles S. from Wroxeter, takes its name from its situation near
the Severn.&nbsp; The land here is highly fertile, and the meadow
lands have a rich herbage.&nbsp; It is also the property of the
Duke of Cleveland.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Norton</span>, a small township, has a few
scattered houses on the Shrewsbury and Wellington turnpike road,

452</span>BRIMSTREE HUNDRED.</h2>
<p>The Hundred of Brimstree is divided into the Bridgnorth and
the Shiffnal divisions.&nbsp; Hales Owen, formerly a third
division of this hundred, being a detached part of the county
surrounded by Worcestershire, has recently, by act of parliament,
been annexed to the county of Worcester.&nbsp; This hundred is
bounded on the north by the county of Stafford and the South
Bradford Hundred, on the west by the Wenlock Franchise and South
Bradford Hundred, on the east by Staffordshire, and on the south
by the Stottesden Hundred.&nbsp; Thomas Charlton Whitmore, Esq.,
M.P., is lord of the hundred, and holds a court on the 24th
April; Mr. George Pritchard, steward; and Mr. John Cullwick,
bailiff.&nbsp; The population in 1801 was 18,817; in 1841 there
were 2,577 houses and 12,458 inhabitants.&nbsp; The annexing of
the populous district of Halesowen to the county of Worcester is
the cause of the returns at the census of 1821 being greater than
those of 1841.</p>
<p>The Bridgnorth division contains the following townships and
places, viz., Aston, Beobridge, Bobbington (part of), Broughton,
Claverley, Dallicott, Farmcott, Gatacre, Heathton, Hopstone,
Ludstone, Shipley, Sutton, Woundale, and Worfield.</p>
<p>The Shiffnal divisions contains Albrighton, Badger, Beckbury,
Boningale, Boscobal, Donnington, Kemberton, Ryton, Shiffnal,
Hatton, Priors&rsquo; Lee, Woodside, Stockton, Sutton, Maddock,
and Tong.</p>
<h3>ALBRIGHTON</h3>
<p>is a parish and populous village in the Shiffnal division of
the Brimstree Hundred, situated five miles south east by east
from Shiffnal, and twenty-three south-east from Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
The parish lies in the eastern verge of the county, and contains
3,365 acres of land, of which 59 acres are in roads and
plantations.&nbsp; In 1801 there were 901 inhabitants; 1831,
1,054; in 1841, 1,058, and 236 houses; and in 1851, 242 houses
and 1,141 souls.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;7,089, 16s.
11d.&nbsp; This pleasant rural village is delightfully situated
in a salubrious part of the county, intersected by good roads,
and contiguous to the Shrewsbury and Birmingham railroad.&nbsp;
Within the last few years it has attracted much attention, and
several handsome villa residences have been built, which are
chiefly occupied by respectable families and tradespeople from
Wolverhampton and the neighbourhood.&nbsp; There are many good
shops in the different branches of the retail trade, and the inns
and boarding houses afford every accommodation to the numerous
visitors who annually attend the celebrated Albrighton
Hunt.&nbsp; The land in this locality has a bold undulating
surface, and the views are varied and beautiful.&nbsp; The farms
are extensive, and by unremitting industry, and an outlay of
capital, have been brought to a state of productiveness far
superior to what has been hitherto known in this district.&nbsp;
The farm houses are in general well built, and provided with
commodious out-premises.&nbsp; The Earl of Shrewsbury is the
principal landowner and lord of the manor.&nbsp; The other chief
owners are Thomas Plowden Presland, Esq.; Launcelot Shadwell,
Esq.; William Oatley, Esq.; the Earl of Dartmouth; Mr. John
Oatley; John Yates, Esq.; George Jones, Esq.; the representatives
of the late John Meeson; Richard Wood, Esq.; and the trustees of
the poor of Tong, Albrighton, and Tattenhall; besides whom there
are several smaller owners.</p>
<p>In the time of Edward the Confessor Albrighton was in two
manorial, divisions, held by Algar, Earl of Menia, and a Saxon,
named Godit.&nbsp; In the reign of the Confessor, one hide and a
half of land in this parish were taxed to the king.&nbsp; After
the conquest it extended to four carucates, when they were in
demesne three carucates, thirteen servants, three villains, and
three borderers, with one carucate of plough land.&nbsp; There
was at that time a wood sufficient to fatten one hundred hogs,
which was then in the hands of the king.&nbsp; <a
name="page453"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 453</span>In the
reign of the Confessor it was valued at 21s., and at the Conquest
at 16s., when it was found wasted, from whence we may learn that
the hand of the Saxon destroyer had been raised in revenge.&nbsp;
In a manuscript of Dr. Hardwicke&rsquo;s, now preserved at the
vicarage, the parish is spoken of as comprising the lordships of
Albrighton and Bishton, the manors and granges of Cosford and
Whiston, and many other places of less note.&nbsp; This lordship
being enjoyed by Norman the Hunter, shortly after the conquest,
was undoubtedly in his possession in 1066, when he and Roger his
brother, lord of Beckbury, attended their superior Lord Roger,
the Count Palatine, and Adelaisa his second countess, at their
palace at Quatford, near Bridgnorth, on the great festal occasion
of the dedication of that church, 22nd July, 1086, which they so
amply endowed with lands and tithes, arising out of several
parishes in this county, as these two lords are particularly
noticed as attesting witnesses, with many other lords of manors,
the vassals of the count.&nbsp; In the reign of King Henry I.
(1102) the manor was granted by the king to his favourite Sir
Ralph de Pitchford, in whose family it continued through several
generations; as Camden states that a Sir Ralph de Pitchford, 29th
of Edward I., had his residence within this manor of Albrighton,
where he died, leaving three sons, John, Nicholas, and Hugh, and
Margery his relict, who in the 32nd year of this reign, recovered
in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, his service against Roger
Charles and William the Beadle of Brimstree, of eleven marks
rent, with appurtenances in Albrighton.&nbsp; John de Pitchford,
the eldest son, was lord of Albrighton and Pitchford, holding
them of the crown by the service of one knight&rsquo;s fee
each.&nbsp; It afterwards passed to Sir John de Tregon, Lord
Tregon, who, dying without male issue, it came to his grandson,
Sir John la Warre, who held in chief by one knight&rsquo;s fee,
and in the 31st of Edward I. obtained a charter to hold a market
on a Tuesday, and a fair on the eve of the day, and the day after
the translation of St. Thomas the Martyr; and also to hold courts
leet and view of frankpledge in the manor half yearly.&nbsp; He
was summoned to parliament from 26th August, 1307, to 26th
February, 1342, and died in the 21st of Edward 3rd, 1347.&nbsp;
About this period Roger Careless, a considerable proprietor of
lands in Albrighton, gave 60 acres of land there to found a
chantry in the Church at Albrighton, to which he added lands and
2s. rent within his manor of Ryton adjoining.&nbsp; The charter
of Albrighton was renewed by King Charles II., and the manor
given or confirmed to the Talbots in 1663.&nbsp; The Lady Mary
Talbot presented the borough with a mace.&nbsp; The market has
long been obsolete, but fairs are held for cattle, sheep, swine,
and general merchandise on the first Monday in March, 23rd of
May, and the last Saturday in June.&nbsp; A feast is held on the
first Sunday after the 18th of July, and races on the following
Monday.&nbsp; A flourishing society of the Manchester Unity of
Odd Fellows, is held at Mr. Bucknall&rsquo;s, the Crown
Inn.&nbsp; The Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway Company have a
station here: Mr. James Davies is the station master.&nbsp; Flys
and cars are daily in attendance at the station on the arrival of
each train.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a venerable fabric,
dedicated to St. Mary, consisting of nave, chancel, and side
aisles, with, a square tower, containing six bells.&nbsp; The
interior is spacious and handsome, and is neatly pewed with dark
oak sittings.&nbsp; Upon the gallery, at the west end, there is a
fine-toned organ.&nbsp; The chancel is divided from the nave by a
lofty pointed arch, and the east window is richly foliated.&nbsp;
The church contains some beautiful tablets and other memorials to
the Talbots and several other distinguished families.&nbsp; An
alabaster tomb has two full length figures in a recumbent
posture, with hands joined in the attitude of prayer; the knight
clothed in a surcoat and chain armour, and his feet resting on a
lion.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;5. 10s., now returned at &pound;651, in the
patronage of the Haberdashers&rsquo; Company and the Governors of
Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, London, alternately.&nbsp; The Rev.
George W. Woodhouse, M.A., is the incumbent.&nbsp; Divine service
is performed twice a-day throughout the year in the church.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Vicarage</span>, a spacious stuccoed
residence, a little east from the church, is ornamented with
pleasure grounds tastefully laid out.&nbsp; The tithes have been
commuted, and <a name="page454"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
454</span>&pound;626. 7s. 2d. apportioned to the vicar, and
&pound;20 to Mr. George Jones.&nbsp; There are 15<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 32<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of glebe land.&nbsp; Gilbert Talbot,
bishop of Bertha, in Italy, resided chiefly at Lower Pepperhill,
in this parish, where he erected a brick mansion, with a court
before it.&nbsp; The pope, in consideration of his high birth,
family connections, and enormous wealth, raised him to the see of
Bertha.&nbsp; He enjoyed his great hereditary property nearly
twenty-six years in much privacy and seclusion, engaging himself
in acts of charity and devotion, and dying at Lower Pepperhill,
on the 12th of December, 1743, was interred in the Catholic
Cemetery of the White Ladies, near Albrighton.&nbsp; There is a
<span class="smcap">Parochial School</span>, in which six boys
are taught gratuitously, in consideration of the schoolmaster
having the free use of the school-house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;By indenture,
dated 18th May, 1682, reciting two bequests to the inhabitants of
Albrighton, one of &pound;20 by one <i>Southall</i>, the other of
&pound;10 by <i>Roger Brooke</i>, the interest of which was to be
yearly disposed of among poor people, and which two sums, with
some accumulation of interest, had increased to &pound;40; and
further reciting a gift by <i>George Bromley</i> of &pound;100,
the yearly profits to be distributed on St. George&rsquo;s day
and the Feast of All Saints, with the yearly increase thereof
then amounted to &pound;150; it was witnessed that in
consideration of the sum of &pound;210, composed of the above
benefactions and a sum of money borrowed for the use of the
parish, to make up the deficiency, certain lands were conveyed in
trust for the benefit of the poor.&nbsp; In the year 1771,
William Whitwich, the only surviving trustee, with the
approbation of the parishioners and inhabitants assembled at a
parish meeting, exchanged the two pieces of land, called the
Wooden Croft, and the Six Butts, containing together four acres,
for certain lands, called the Pool Field, containing two acres
and rood, and a sum of &pound;60 in money.&nbsp; The lands held
in trust for the poor, when the charity commissioners published
their report, comprised 14<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 16<span class="smcap">p</span>. and a
workhouse which had been built upon the charity land, together
producing a yearly rental of &pound;61 16s. 1d.&nbsp; The sum of
&pound;60 paid by Thomas Meeson, in part consideration for the
exchange for lands in 1771, was suffered to remain in his hands
at an interest of &pound;4 per cent. till May, 1779, when it
appears to have been paid up and applied, together with two other
sums of &pound;31. 10s., and &pound;20 belonging to the trust,
making in the whole &pound;111. 10s. in the erection of a
building for the reception of paupers, for which the parish paid
a rent of &pound;7 from the year 1780.&nbsp; This application of
these several sums is not indeed expressly stated in the
trustees&rsquo; books, or in any of the parish books or other
documents that we could procure; but it seems sufficiently to be
inferred from the circumstance that the payment of interest on
those sums appears in the books till the year 1780, when it
ceases, and the payment of rent for the workhouse
commences.&nbsp; As this house is kept in repair from the trust
funds, it does not seem to have been a very beneficial investment
of the money.&nbsp; From whence the two sums of money above
mentioned were derived does not appear.&nbsp; In the returns,
under the act of the 26th Geo. III., two legacies to this parish
of uncertain date are mentioned, one of &pound;40 by <i>William
Scot</i>, and the other of &pound;20 by <i>T.
Davenhill</i>.&nbsp; It is possible that a part of the first and
the whole of the second of these legacies may have constituted
part of the funds for the erection of the parish poorhouse.&nbsp;
This, however, is mere conjecture, as we could learn nothing
further concerning these charities.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Chapman</i>, in 1655, granted to trustees three
several rent charges, amounting in the whole to 30s., issuing out
of a messuage called Harbour House and certain lands within the
manor of Donington, and directed 13s. 4d. (part thereof) to be
distributed among the poor of Albrighton, 10s. among the poor of
Donington, and 6s. 8d. (the residue) for the relief of the poor
inhabitants within the parish of Boningale.&nbsp; The amount
allotted to Albrighton is carried to the general charity fund of
the parish.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Mary Waltho</i>, in 1783, gave the sum of &pound;20,
in trust, to place out the same, with the approbation of the
minister and churchwardens of the parish, the interest to be
disposed of among poor widows.&nbsp; An annual sum of 16s., which
is understood to be the <a name="page455"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 455</span>interest of this legacy, was paid by
Mr. Meeson.&nbsp; Mr. Meeson stated to the Charity Commissioners
that his father had been accustomed to make the payment to poor
widows, from whence he concluded that he had received the
&pound;20 left by Mrs. Waltho.&nbsp; It does not appear that any
security is given for it; nor do the minister and churchwardens
interfere with the distribution of the interest.</p>
<p>In 1848, a portion of the charity land was required for making
the railway, for which the Charity Trustees received the sum of
&pound;712. 3s. 3d., which has been invested in government
securities; the dividends of which and the rent of lands amount
at the present time to about &pound;74 per annum, which is
distributed on Holy Thursday and St. Thomas&rsquo;s day among
widows and the indigent poor not receiving parochial relief.</p>

<h3>BADGER</h3>
<p>is a parish in the Shiffnal division of the Brimstree hundred,
six miles N.N.E. from Bridgnorth and five and a half miles S.
from Shiffnal, comprising 980 acres of land, of which upwards of
100 acres are covered with woods and thriving plantations.&nbsp;
The soil is various, the meadows and pastures produce a rich
herbage, and the arable lands are highly productive.&nbsp;
Rateable value &pound;768.&nbsp; The parish in 1801 contained 88
inhabitants: 1831, 142: 1841, 137: and in 1851 there were 38
houses and a population of 101 souls, of whom 79 were males and
92 females.&nbsp; The village of Badger is delightfully situated
in a district pleasingly diversified with bold undulations and
rural scenery; the low lands are watered by the meanderings of
the Cosford brook, and the small stream of the Worf.&nbsp; A
romantic glen called the Dingle stretches for upwards of a mile
in length, and the banks of the stream have been planted with
shrubs and evergreens with great taste; in several places the
waters are precipitated over the shelving rocks into the dingle
below, which gives an additional charm to the picturesque
scenery.&nbsp; This locality is the frequent resort of pleasure
parties from Birmingham and the surrounding country during the
summer months.&nbsp; Robert Henry Cheney, Esq., of Badger Hall,
is the principal landowner, and lord of the manor; Mr. John Green
is also a landowner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Giles,
is a small but neat structure of free stone, having a square
tower ornamented with crocketted pinnacles; the tower is
beautified with a clock, sun-dial, and contains three bells; the
interior of the church has a tasteful and elegant appearance, and
the side compartments are neatly pewed with oak sittings.&nbsp;
The east window is beautifully decorated with stained glass
illustrative of scripture history; the appendages of tracery are
of the most exquisite workmanship.&nbsp; The altar exhibits a
fine specimen of elaborate carving.&nbsp; The parishioners of
Worfield, who reside near Badger, in consideration of being
accommodated with sittings in this church, presented a new organ
in the year 1844.&nbsp; In the chancel is an elegant <a
name="page457"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 457</span>memorial in
memory of Isaac Hawkins Brown, Esq., of this parish, D.C.L., and
F.R.S., who died in 1818.&nbsp; A full length figure of the
purest statuary marble, (one of Chantrey&rsquo;s masterly
productions) is represented as seated and perusing a book, on the
side of which are several large quarto volumes in marble.&nbsp;
Underneath the monument is an inscription in memory of his wife
Elizabeth Brown.&nbsp; There is also a tablet beautifully
designed, with the figure of a female in bass-relief to Jane
Brown, and other members of the family, dated 1783.&nbsp; The
Rev. William Smith, late rector of Badger, is remembered on a
neat memorial dated 1837.&nbsp; There are others to Joseph Green
and his wife, and to Elizabeth Kinnersley, the latter is dated
1619.&nbsp; In the church yard are several ancient tombs which
have been erected in memory of deceased members of some of the
principal families in the parish.&nbsp; The living is a rectory
valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;4. 13s. 4d., now
returned at &pound;280, in the patronage of Robert Henry Cheney,
Esq.: incumbent, Rev. Thomas Freeman Boddington, M.A.&nbsp; In

<h3>BOSCOBEL</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">an Extra Parochial Liberty</span> in the
Shiffnal division of the Brimstree hundred, is remarkable in
history as a place in which King Charles II. concealed himself
from his pursuers, after the unfortunate battle of
Worcester.&nbsp; The liberty comprises two houses and 691<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 17<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, of which eighty acres are in
woods, and is situated on the eastern verge of the county,
adjoining Staffordshire, seven miles east from Shiffnal.&nbsp;
The bold eminence upon which Boscobel is situated is most
delightful, and is one of the finest tracts of table land in
England; the scenery is most extensive, beautiful, and
varied.&nbsp; Boscobel manor house is a spacious and ancient
timbered mansion exhibiting a fine specimen of the domestic
architecture of bygone days; part of it has been recently
modernized and stuccoed, which gives it a light and handsome
appearance.&nbsp; The house stands partly in Shropshire and
partly in Staffordshire, and the southern portion now forms the
summer residence of the Misses Evans, of Darley, near
Derby.&nbsp; The dining room is spacious, and the walls are
wainscotted with oak, exhibiting some fine carving; on the right
of the entrance is shown the secret recess through which King
Charles II. made his escape from the house to the oak tree when
pursued by the infuriated rebels.&nbsp; There is a fine painting
in this room of the youthful monarch, and in a side room is a
beautifully executed painting of Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; Although
the interior of the mansion has been much improved and beautified
from time to time, yet whatever relates to the concealment of the
unfortunate Charles has been preserved with the greatest
care.&nbsp; On ascending the staircase is seen the bed room and
the secret recess where he took shelter from his pursuers, and
which communicates with the garden by a trap-door.&nbsp; In the
upper room is what is denominated the &ldquo;sacred hole&rdquo;
from the circumstance of his majesty occasionally concealing
himself there, the trap-door and step-ladder remain in their
original state.</p>
<p><a name="page460"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 460</span>The
following circumstances relating to this remarkable and
interesting event are taken from various authorities:&mdash;His
majesty, as soon as he perceived which way the victory at the
disastrous battle of Worcester inclined, was not unmindful to
provide for his own safety.&nbsp; He had during the battle
performed all the offices both of a valiant man and a good
commander, riding about incessantly to encourage his soldiers,
and when he saw they began to fail he was heard to utter this
pathetic expression, &ldquo;Rather shoot me than let me live to
see the sad consequences of this fatal day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many
parties of horse were sent out through all the country after the
flying troops.&nbsp; Few of the infantry escaped from the field
alive, and but about three thousand horse, of whom one thousand
were taken near Bewdley by Colonel Barton, and more by others in
different places.&nbsp; In this fatal engagement the number of
the slain was supposed to be three thousand, among whom were many
of the nobility and gentlemen, and principal officers who
supported the royal cause.&nbsp; The king lost a hundred and
fifty-eight stand of colours, his standard bearer, his collar of
S.S., his coach and horses, and other things of great
value.&nbsp; His majesty after the battle was very narrowly
searched for, and it was on his account that the greater
diligence was employed in following and intercepting the routed
Scots; but notwithstanding all the search and inquiry no news
could be heard, nor could any one certainly tell what was become
of him.&nbsp; When the enemy had forced the gate, all possible
care was taken to secure his majesty, and for this purpose the
Earl of Cleveland, Sir James Hamilton, and others, kept the enemy
engaged in Sudbury street, while the king unpursued took his way
with a body of horse through St. Martin&rsquo;s gate about six
o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp; When he arrived at
Brabon&rsquo;s bridge, about half a mile from the town, he halted
in order to advise with a few noblemen and gentlemen that were
with him, and as there was not the slightest probability of being
able to rally again, it was determined with all speed to make
their way to Scotland.&nbsp; Having proceeded about half way to
Presteign, the king was informed that a detachment of troops was
in pursuit of him, on which he immediately changed his route to
Shropshire, the Earl of Derby recommending Boscobel house as a
place of temporary sanctuary.&nbsp; Mr. Giffard and Mr. Yates
having been chosen as guides, they arrived at break of day, at a
house called White Ladies, about half a mile from Boscobel.&nbsp;
This house was formerly a monastery of Cistercian nuns, who from
their habit were denominated the White Ladies, and this name,
notwithstanding the abolition of the order, adhered to the
house.</p>
<p>Here his majesty was committed to the care of the Pendrills,
and for his better disguise, put on the green Kendal breeches and
leathern doublet of Richard Pendrill.&nbsp; Lord Wilmot who
performed the office of barber, cut the hair of the King in a
most rustic manner, and caused his hands and face to be
discoloured with the intention of giving him the appearance of a
country labourer.&nbsp; His majesty thus transformed, with a wood
bill in his hand assumed the character of a wood cutter, and was
taken by a back road into a wood called Spring Coppice belonging
to Boscobel House, by Richard Pendrill, who attended the King
while the three other brothers of Richard were set to watch and
give intelligence of any threatened danger.&nbsp; A short time
after the King had left the house a party of horse came to search
it; it was therefore thought the safest course for his majesty to
remain in the wood all that day, although the rain fell in
torrents.&nbsp; The King being in urgent want of refreshment,
made his wishes known to Richard Pendrill, who accordingly
applied to the wife of Francis Yates to provide some provision
for a person in want and to carry it to an appointed place in
Boscobel wood.&nbsp; She accordingly provided a dish of such fare
as her cottage afforded, and taking a blanket with her, proceeded
therewith to the wood.&nbsp; On her approaching the spot fixed
upon she perceived the King, who being much surprised at the
appearance of a woman, became apprehensive that she might
possibly divulge the secret of his retreat, till demanding of the
good woman if she could be faithful to a distressed cavalier, she
answered &ldquo;Yes Sire, I would rather die than discover
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; At night his majesty resolved to proceed into
Wales, and take Richard Pendrill with him as his guide; they
began their journey <a name="page461"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 461</span>that night to Madeley, where lived a
zealous royalist named Wolfe.&nbsp; The night was very dark and
as they passed by Evelyn bridge, Richard permitting a gate to
clap too loudly, brought out a miller at that place, and on his
bidding them stand Richard ran through the water and the King
followed by the sound of his calfskin breeches.&nbsp; The miller
imagining that these persons were on the search was not less
alarmed than they were, having then under his protection in the
mill several fugitive loyalists who had escaped from the bloody
field of Worcester.&nbsp; On their arrival at Madeley they
proceeded to Wolfe&rsquo;s house, but there being so many
soldiers in the neighbourhood it was considered unsafe for them
to remain in the house, and they found refuge in a hay-loft which
was their bed till Friday night.&nbsp; It had been his
majesty&rsquo;s intention to pass the Severn and so proceed into
Wales, but learning that all the passages over the river were
strictly guarded and that all the ferry boats were stopped, they
returned somewhat late on Friday night towards Boscobel.&nbsp;
Colonel Carles, who when his majesty left Worcester was bravely
combating the enemy in Sudbury street to favour the King&rsquo;s
escape, was now come to that place for refuge and relief.&nbsp;
The Colonel who was well acquainted with the house and its
inhabitants, having been born and educated not far off, was no
sooner informed that the King was in the wood than he hastened
with joy to present himself to his majesty.&nbsp; After mutual
congratulations they proceeded to the house to refresh
themselves, and then immediately retiring into the wood and
finding a large oak whose branches afforded them a safe retreat,
they ascended the tree, and with the help of cushions made a
tolerable abode there till night.&nbsp; At night they betook
themselves again to the house where his majesty thought proper
for the future to trust himself while he remained in that part of
the country, being much pleased with a secret corner which
William Pendrill shewed him, where the Earl of Derby concealed
himself after the misfortune of his defeat at Wigan.&nbsp; Being
now in hopeful security he permitted William Pendrill to shave
him and cut his hair short at the top, but leaving it long about
the ears, as was the country mode in those days.</p>
<p>On Humphrey Pendrill going to Shiffnal to pay his share of the
monthly tax, he was accosted at the house of Captain Broadway, by
a colonel who had come hither to enquire after the search of the
White Ladies.&nbsp; The colonel understanding that Humphrey lived
near the place, put him to a strict examination, and after he had
tried the effect of menaces to induce a confession, began to
tempt him by the reward of the thousand pounds which was offered
to the person that discovered his majesty; Humphrey&rsquo;s
discreet answers, however, rendered his dissembled ignorance the
more unsuspected.&nbsp; On this being told to his majesty he was
determined to leave Boscobel, and it was arranged that he should
ride upon Humphrey Pendrill&rsquo;s mill horse, for Humphrey was
miller at the White Ladies Mill.&nbsp; The king mounted his steed
on Monday evening and was attended by four of the Pendrills and
their brother-in-law Francis Yates, who guarded him on the road
with bills and pike staves.&nbsp; Humphrey led the horse by the
bridle, and on his majesty complaining that it was the dullest
jade he ever rode on, Humphrey made a witty apology for his steed
by telling his majesty that it was no wonder he went so slow
since he carried the weight of three kingdoms on his back.&nbsp;
The King at this time was dressed in a leathern doublet and an
old greasy hat, his hands and face being coloured with soot and
walnut leaves.&nbsp; In this way they journeyed to Moseley in
Staffordshire, and there found a place of safety in the house of
Mr. Whitgrave, who had formerly been engaged in the king&rsquo;s
service, and being a suspected person his house was searched
while the king was there, but the readiness of Mr. Whitgrave to
let the soldiers enter, and his open deportment, gave the men so
much satisfaction that they went away with little more than a
bare enquiry.&nbsp; The White Ladies was also searched the same
day, on the information of an ensign, and the proprietor strictly
questioned about the king with a musket presented at his
breast.&nbsp; He acknowledged that a large party had been there
who had almost eaten him out of house and home, but the king he
did not know from any other man, and no such person being there
to be found, the searchers at last went away, storming that they
had troubled <a name="page462"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
462</span>themselves so much in vain, and the ensign was paid for
his diligence with blows and contempt.&nbsp; The King on one
occasion being concealed in a house belonging to Mrs. Jane Lane,
his pursuers having some idea of his being there, came in a body
to examine it, but on Mrs. Lane observing their approach she
immediately clad the king in a rustic dress and put a slouched
hat on his head, and on the entering of the soldiers Charles
looked around, which the good old dame observing seized a basting
ladle, and giving the king a sharp blow on the back exclaimed in
apparent anger &ldquo;And what do you stare at, you dog you; why
don&rsquo;t you mind what you&rsquo;re about.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
reprimand furnished the King with a pretext for keeping his eyes
towards the spit, by which means he escaped discovery.</p>
<p>His majesty having gratefully acknowledged the kindness of Mr.
Whitgrave, went with Lord Wilmot to Colonel Lane&rsquo;s, at
Bentley, where shortly after he had an opportunity of being
conveyed to Bristol, in order to embark for France.&nbsp; Miss
Jane Lane procured a pass for herself and servant, to visit a
pretended sister of hers who resided near to Bristol, and in the
journey his majesty assumed the character of Miss Lane&rsquo;s
servant; Colonel Lascelles, Miss Lane&rsquo;s relation, with his
wife behind him, accompanied them; and Lord Wilmot, with a hawk
in his hand, as if he had met them accidentally, and had occasion
to travel that way.&nbsp; In passing through Broomsgrove they
were obliged to employ a smith to shoe one of the horses; the
conversation of the bystanders was of the battle of Worcester and
the king&rsquo;s escape.&nbsp; His majesty, amidst many
conjectures, gave it as his decided opinion that the king had
fled to Scotland, and lay concealed there.&nbsp; &ldquo;I rather
think,&rdquo; replied the smith, &ldquo;that he remains somewhere
concealed in England, and how glad should I be if I knew
where.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the third day they arrived at the house of
Mr. George Norton, of Leigh, about two miles from Bristol, where
the king was introduced as the son of one of her father&rsquo;s
tenants, and on pretence of suddenly being attacked with fever,
kept his bed, and was attended by Dr. George, who asked the sick
man many questions about the king&rsquo;s escape, and being told
by his majesty that he did not wish to be troubled with such
questions, declared that he could not help thinking that his
patient was a sider with the roundheads.&nbsp; His majesty had
not been long here before he was discovered by the butler, who
had formerly been in the service of his royal father.&nbsp; This
man, on the promise of close secrecy and loyalty, was entrusted
by his majesty in several important services.&nbsp; From this
place he proceeded amidst great dangers, experiencing unchanging
fidelity, to Brighthelmston, in Sussex, when on the 15th of
October, 1659, he took sail in a small coasting vessel, employed
in the colliery trade, and being favoured with a prosperous gale
they arrived in a short time at Feccam, a small sea port in
Normandy, his majesty assisting himself to steer the
vessel.&nbsp; From Feccam his majesty proceeded to Roan, and on
the 30th October was met on his journey to Paris by his mother,
the Queen Dowager of Great Britain, his brother the Duke of York,
the Duke of Orleans, and other nobles of France, with a great
retinue of English and French gentlemen.</p>
<p>On the restoration of King Charles, the family of the
Pendrills, who consisted of five brothers, attended upon his
majesty on the 13th of June, 1660, at Whitehall, when the king
was pleased to remark that the simple rustic who serves his
sovereign in the time of need to the extent of his ability, is as
deserving of our commendation as the victorious leader of
thousands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friend Richard,&rdquo; rejoined the king,
&ldquo;thou wert my preserver and conductor&mdash;the bright star
that shewed me my way to Bethlehem, for which kindness I will
engrave thy memory in the tablet of a grateful heart;&rdquo; and
having requested Richard to state to the lords in attendance what
passed when he quitted the oak at Boscobel, &ldquo;Your
majesty,&rdquo; replied Richard, &ldquo;must well remember that
when brother Humphrey brought his old mill horse from White
Ladies, not accoutered with knightly gear, but with a pitiful old
saddle and bridle; not attended with royal guards, but only by
half a dozen raw and undisciplined rustics, who had but little
else but good will to defend your majesty; it was when your
majesty mounted, and as we journeyed your majesty did most <a
name="page463"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 463</span>heartily
complain of the jade you rode on, and said it was the dullest
creature you ever met with, whereupon Humphrey remarked,
&lsquo;My liege, can you blame the horse to go heavily when he
had the weight of three kingdoms on his back?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The royal oak before mentioned stood about 200 yards from the
house, and was a flourishing tree, the branches of which were so
richly covered with ivy that the soldiers who were in pursuit of
the king, and who suspected him to be there, could not discover
him.&nbsp; In the course of time the original oak was so
mutilated by visitors that to preserve its remains the
Fitzherberts erected a brick wall around it.&nbsp; The tree,
however, has long been destroyed, and there is now standing on
the site a flourishing oak, produced from an acorn of the old
tree, for the preservation of which a lofty iron palisading
surrounds it.&nbsp; The following inscription on a brass plate is
affixed to the bole of the tree:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Felicissimam

<p><span class="smcap">The Convent of White
Ladies</span>.&mdash;Near half a mile south from Boscobel, in a
sequestered and romantic spot, are the ruins of the Nunnery of
White Ladies, an establishment of nuns of the Cistercian order,
designated the White Ladies by reason of the conventical habit
which they adopted being of that colour, as also to distinguish
it from another establishment in its immediate vicinity,
denominated the Black Ladies, situated at Bishop&rsquo;s Wood, in
the county of Stafford.&nbsp; The ruins of this venerable
structure are mantled with ivy, and the walls of the church are
of immense thickness, with a recessed circular doorway.&nbsp; It
is dedicated to St. Leonard, and the foundation is supposed to
have been as ancient as the time of King Richard I., or King
John.&nbsp; The two seals that have been met with relating to
this establishment represent the virgin and child, one of which
bears the legend, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sigillum commune
nigrarum monalium D&rsquo;Bre</span>,&rdquo; and the other
&ldquo;S. <span class="smcap">Convent</span>.&nbsp; S. <span
class="smcap">Marie Nigras d&rsquo;narum</span>,&rdquo; and seem
to have been used as the common seal of the White Ladies and
Black Ladies conjointly, these two houses having been considered
as comprising the convent of Brewood.&nbsp; The ruins and grounds
of this religious house are walled in, and the interior, which is
spacious, is nearly covered with gravestones.&nbsp; It is still
used as a place of sepulchre by members of the catholic
religion.&nbsp; There are several tablets on the walls, and some
remarkable epitaphs.&nbsp; On a gravestone is the following
inscription: &ldquo;Here lies Winifred White, late of
Wolverhampton, who was instantaneously cured of hemiphegia by
bathing in St. Winifred&rsquo;s well, Flintshire, June 11th,
1805.&nbsp; She died of consumption, January 13th, 1824, aged 45
years.&nbsp; May she rest in peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The White Ladies
Nunnery became celebrated in history from the circumstance <a
name="page464"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 464</span>of its
having afforded a temporary shelter and a place of successful
concealment to his Majesty King Charles II., immediately on his
flight from the disastrous and fatal battle of Worcester.&nbsp;
At the dissolution of religious houses, this nunnery, then styled
the Convent of Brewood, consisted of six religious.&nbsp; The
total revenue was stated to amount annually to &pound;31. 1s.
4d.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry VIII. the site was granted to
William Whorwood; it is now possessed by the Catholic
community.&nbsp; The Misses Evans are the principal freeholders
in Boscobel, and have been instrumental in building a church at
Bishop&rsquo;s Wood, which has just been completed.&nbsp; The
ladies also liberally contribute towards the education of the
children, and in supplying the necessities of the poor in this
vicinity.</p>
<p>The principal residents are Miss Elizabeth Evans, Boscobel
House; Miss Fanny Evans, Boscobel House; Mrs. Walker; Thomas
Wilson, farmer, White Ladies; Thomas Wilson, jun., farmer,
Boscobel Farm.</p>
<h3>CLAVERLEY</h3>
<p>is an extensive parish in the Bridgnorth division of the
Brimstree hundred, comprising the townships of Aston, Beobridge,
Broughton, Claverley, Dallicott, Farmcott, Gatacre, Heathton,
Hopstone, Ludstone, Shipley, Sutton, and Woundale, and embraces
8,145<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>.
39<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land.&nbsp; In 1801 there were
1,328 inhabitants; 1831, 1,521; 1841, 1,669; and in 1851, 1,612,
of whom 825 were males, and 787 females.&nbsp; The last census
shows a decrease of 57 persons in ten years.&nbsp; Gross
estimated rental of the parish, &pound;17,796. 8s. 2d.&nbsp;
Rateable value, &pound;15,766. 10s.&nbsp; The tithes have been
commuted for &pound;2,060. 13s. 6d.&nbsp; The principal
landowners are Edward Lloyd Gatacre, Esq.; George Mackenzie
Kettle, Esq.; Edward Farrer Acton, Esq.; Farmer Taylor, Esq.;
Thomas Charlton Whitmore, Esq., M.P.; William Wilson, Esq.; John
Wilson, Esq.; Thomas Wilson, Esq.; Thomas H. Windle, Esq.; Thomas
Boycott, Esq.; and Mrs. Emma Fox; besides whom there are several
smaller freeholders.&nbsp; The village of Claverley is well built
and pleasantly situated, six miles east from Bridgnorth, and ten
miles south-west from Wolverhampton.&nbsp; At the census in 1841,
the township contained 90 houses and 404 inhabitants.&nbsp; This
was the birth-place of Sir Robert Brooke, who was educated at
Oxford, from whence he removed to the Middle Temple.&nbsp; In
1553 he became chief justice of the common pleas, in which office
he conducted himself with inflexible integrity, and died in
1558.&nbsp; He published several works, among which are,
&ldquo;An Abridgment of the Year Books,&rdquo; in folio;
&ldquo;Certain Cases Adjudged;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reading on the
Statutes of Limitations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Richard Dovey, the founder
of the Free School, bequeathed eight shillings per annum to a
poor man of this parish who should undertake to awaken sleepers
and whip out dogs from the church of Claverley during divine
service.&nbsp; King Charles II. granted the inhabitants a charter
to exempt them from paying tolls.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to All
Saints, is an antique structure, exhibiting various styles of
architecture, and consists of nave, chancel, side chapels, and
side aisles, with a square tower, in which are six bells.&nbsp;
The body of the church is neatly pewed, and will accommodate
about eight hundred persons.&nbsp; There is a gallery at the west
end, upon which is an organ, erected in the year 1840 at a cost
of &pound;180.&nbsp; The pulpit is of oak, and has been
beautifully carved at the expense of the present incumbent.&nbsp;
The side chapels are the property of the ancient family of
Gatacre.&nbsp; In the south chapel is an altar tomb, dated 1558,
on which are three full length figures, in a recumbent position,
in memory of Lord Chief Justice Brooke and his two wives.&nbsp;
On the sides of the tomb, in basso-relief, are small figures of
his eighteen children.&nbsp; A beautiful memorial window of
stained glass, exquisitely executed, remembers Colonel Gatacre,
who died in the year 1849.&nbsp; Another has been erected to the
memory of Arabella, wife of the late Colonel Gatacre.&nbsp; One
of the windows has recently been beautified with stained glass by
Edward Lloyd Gatacre, Esq.&nbsp; The church contains several neat
mural tablets to deceased members <a name="page465"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 465</span>of some of the principal families of
the parish.&nbsp; The font, which is of free-stone, has been
painted in imitation of marble.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual
curacy, returned at &pound;267, in the patronage of Thomas
Charlton Whitmore, Esq., M.P.; incumbent, Rev. George Hilder
Betterton Gabert, M.A.&nbsp; The parish register dates from the
year 1568.&nbsp; The ancient stone cross, now standing in the
church-yard, was removed from the central part of the village
some years ago, in consequence of its obstructing the traffic of
the road.&nbsp; This is called The Processional Cross of
Claverley, and was erected, it is presumed, in the 33rd of Edward
III., to commemorate the dreadful plague which devastated this
neighbourhood, and carried the horrors of death into every
dwelling.&nbsp; When the tithes were commuted &pound;1,599. 8s.
were apportioned to T. C. Whitmore, Esq., &pound;448. 5s. 6d. to
other lay impropriators, and &pound;12 to the Incumbent of
Claverley.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Parsonage House</span>
is a neat brick structure, pleasantly situated near the
church.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The National School</span>,
situated on the east side of the church-yard, was built in the
year 1790; about 60 children attend.&nbsp; There is also a
Girls&rsquo; School in the village, supported by voluntary
subscriptions, which has an attendance of about thirty
children.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>John Dovey</i>,
of Farmcote, by deed of feoffment, dated 23rd of August, 1659,
granted to John Sanders and others a stone house, with a garden
and plot of land adjoining, situated at Hawe&rsquo;s Acre; and
also certain cottages adjoining the parish church of Claverley,
and a messuage and farm known by the name of Lindridge farm, in
trust; the stone house and garden to remain as a free-school, to
be called The Free School of Richard Dovey, at Claverley; and as
to the messuage, farm, and cottages before mentioned, the
trustees were directed, with the yearly profits thereof, to keep
in repair the school premises, and to pay the schoolmaster
yearly, at Michaelmas and Lady-day, &pound;8, in equal portions,
towards his maintenance; to pay to the best scholar to be elected
by the feoffees, the minister, and the schoolmaster, the sum of
20s. to be an under-teacher in the said school; and also to place
in some room of the cottages adjoining the church-yard, a poor
man, and allow him a stipend of eight shillings yearly to whip
out dogs and awaken sleepers during divine service in the church;
and 12s. to the trustees for their pains.&nbsp; It appears that
the cottages, having become untenable about the year 1784, were
taken down; and a new building convenient for a school having
been erected upon the site, the school was removed to it, and has
since continued to be kept there.&nbsp; Upon the removal of the
school, the old premises were exchanged for a parcel of land more
convenient in situation to the new school-room.&nbsp; It appears,
however, that a substitution has since taken place of another
parcel of land, in lieu of that which was first given in exchange
to the charity, and that upon the parcel so substituted timber
has been cut, and other acts of ownership exercised from time to
time by the agents of the Glynne family; while on the other hand
no acknowledgment of ownership has been made to the
charity.&nbsp; The premises at Lindridge, to which an allotment
of about two acres was added about ten years ago, under the
powers of an enclosure act, consist of about 42 acres of land,
producing a yearly rental of &pound;26. 53.&nbsp; <i>Richard
Bennett</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, by will, 22nd March, 1794, gave the sum
of &pound;100, to be paid at the expiration of six months after
his decease, and directed the same to be placed out at interest,
and the yearly proceeds applied for the benefit of the
free-school of Claverley.&nbsp; This legacy remained in the hands
of the Glynne family, as the personal representatives of the
testator, at an annual interest of five per cent. when the
Charity Commissioners published their report.&nbsp; This interest
being added to the rent of the farm makes an annual income of
&pound;31. 5s.; from which the following disbursements are
made:&mdash;To the schoolmaster, &pound;21; coals for the school,
10s.; annuity for awaking sleepers, 10s. 6d.; chief rent, 1s.
4d.; average of school repairs, &pound;2. 12s.&nbsp; The twenty
shillings which were allowed by the founder for one of the boys
to act as usher, do not appear to have ever been paid, nor do we
find that the trustees have taken advantage of the 12s. per annum
allowed for their pains.&nbsp; The expenditure left a surplus of
&pound;6. 11s. 2d. per annum, which, with a sum of &pound;14
produced from a sale of timber from <a name="page466"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 466</span>the school estate in 1819, had
increased to &pound;195. 2s. 9&frac12;d., and was then in the
hands of Edward Gatacre, Esq., one of the trustees.&nbsp; <i>John
Dovey</i>, in 1695, gave a rent charge of 10s. per annum, and
directed the amount to be given to one of the poor
scholars.&nbsp; <i>John Sanders</i>, in 1702, devised certain
lands, subject to the payment of &pound;5 per annum, to be laid
out in clothing poor boys in the free school.&nbsp; The property
thus charged with the payment is now possessed by the Glynne
family, whose agent supplies clothing to an amount much exceeding
the annuity charged upon the lands.&nbsp; The scholars are
appointed by the trustees of the school from among poor children
of the parish, and are taught reading, writing, and arithmetic,
and are also each provided with a coat, waistcoat, and breeches
(of blue cloth), and a hat.</p>
<p><i>William Perry</i>, of Broughton, by will dated 9th
December, 1674, after reciting that his father had given the sum
of 3s. 4d. to be yearly distributed at Christmas and Easter among
the poor of the parish in wheaten or mun corn bread, gave a like
sum of 3s. 4d. to be distributed in bread at Whitsuntide and All
Saints for ever.&nbsp; And for the maintenance of the dole, (and
of bread to the amount of 6s. 8d. also to the poor of Worfield),
he granted a rent charge of 13s. 4d. yearly, issuing out of
certain lands in Claverley and Worfield.&nbsp; It is recorded on
one of the benefaction tables in the church at Claverley that
William Perry of Broughton, by will left 14s. a year for ever to
be distributed in bread amongst the poor of the parish at four
times in the year.&nbsp; There is reason to believe that William
Perry here referred to was a descendant of the former, but we are
unable to discover whether this was an original grant of his own,
or whether it included the 6s. 8d. which had before been granted
by his ancestors in the same manner as the first William Perry
had by his will embraced the previous donation of his father
Roger.&nbsp; The sum of 14s. is however all that is now paid, or
that we can find any trace of having ever been received.&nbsp; It
is paid out of the rents of lands in Broughton, formerly the
property of the Perrys.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Whitmore</i>, of Ludstone, in 1679 gave to the poor
of the parish of Claverley &pound;5 per annum, payable out of a
tenement in Claverley, and he appointed the same to be received
by the inhabitants for the time being of his then dwelling house
in Ludstone, and to be by them distributed among the necessitous
poor.&nbsp; The amount is usually distributed among fifty poor
persons.</p>
<p><i>Margaret Fregleton</i>, of Powk Hall, by will left 10s.
yearly to be given amongst ten poor widows not chargeable to the
parish.&nbsp; There is reason to believe this legacy to be the
same which is referred to and secured by the will of Mrs.
Margaret Hill, dated 7th January, 1728, when she charges all her
lands in Claverley with the payment of 10s. yearly to ten poor
widows of Claverley, as directed by her mother&rsquo;s will, and
also paying thereout &pound;2. 10s. per annum, on St.
Thomas&rsquo;s day, to be distributed among fit objects of
charity, by the minister and churchwardens.&nbsp; The premises
charged with the payment came into the possession of the Glynne
family, by whose agent the rent charge is paid.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Acton</i> in 1734 gave the sum of &pound;100 to be
laid out in the purchase of lands, and the rents and profits to
be yearly paid by the churchwardens for the time being, to five
decayed labourers, and five poor widows belonging this
parish.&nbsp; This legacy was laid out in 1741 in the purchase of
about seven acres of meadow land in the parish of Hopton Wafers,
which at the time of the purchase produced a rent of &pound;3.
8s., but are now let for &pound;15 per annum.&nbsp; There was
timber on the land at the period the charity commissioners
published their report, to the value of &pound;100, which it was
intended soon to dispose of.</p>
<p><i>John Fenton</i>, by his will bequeathed &pound;30, and
directed that with the interest thereof bread should be
purchased, and on every Sunday a distribution made to six poor
widows belonging the parish of Claverley.&nbsp; In 1777 this
bequest was expended in the erection of three small tenements at
the back of the workhouse, fronting the Holloway, for the use of
the parish as habitations for the poor, and the overseer of the
poor covenanted to distribute six penny loaves every Sunday
according to the intentions of the donor.</p>
<p><a name="page467"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
467</span><i>Mrs. Mary Hodgkiss</i> in 1774, by will gave
&pound;100, and directed the interest thereof to be on the 19th
of March in every year distributed by the churchwardens among
twenty poor widows of this parish.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Farmer Thornes</i> in 1779 bequeathed &pound;30 to
the churchwardens of Claverley, the interest thereof to be
distributed in bread annually to poor housekeepers.&nbsp; This
sum and an accumulation of interest making in the whole
&pound;47. 18s. 1d. was subsequently laid out in building a
parish workhouse, the parish officers agreeing to provide out of
the poor&rsquo;s rates the interest of that sum.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Sarah Taylor</i> left a legacy of &pound;50 many years
ago to the poor of this parish, to be under the management of the
trustees of the Free school.&nbsp; This gift was placed in the
hands of Mr. Farmer Taylor, he being one of the trustees of the
School.&nbsp; The interest was distributed with a private charity
of Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><i>Edward Barker</i>, by will in 1702, charged a piece of land
situate at Aston with the payment of 10s. yearly; 5s. thereof to
be given to the minister of Claverley, for a sermon on New
Year&rsquo;s day, and 5s. to buy bibles for poor children.</p>
<p><i>Richard Dovey</i>, the founder of the free school, in 1660
left certain lands lying in Broughton, for the better maintenance
of the parson of Claverley.&nbsp; The lands which are supposed to
have been left consist of 6<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 21<span class="smcap">p</span>. at
Broughton, and now produce a rental of about &pound;10 per annum,
which is received by the minister for his own use.</p>
<p><i>William Whitmore</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, of Apley, in 1724 gave
the sum of &pound;200 to be laid out for the perpetual
augmentation of the curacy of the parish church of Claverley,
which with the further sum of &pound;200 advanced by the
governors of Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty, was applied to the
purchase of about forty-four acres of land in the parish of
Higley, for the benefit of the incumbent.&nbsp; The premises
produce &pound;49 per annum, which the minister of Claverley
receives.</p>
<p>It appears that the rent of a piece of land called the School
House bank, containing about two acres, has been for many years
appropriated to the repair of the church, but we have been unable
to discover the source from which it was derived.&nbsp; It was
sold in 1818 by the parishioners to Sir Stephen Glynne for the
sum of &pound;120, and the amount was applied in building the
workhouse before mentioned, and interest at the rate of five per
cent, amounting to &pound;6 per annum is now paid by the
overseers to the churchwardens, by whom it is applied to the
repairs of the church.&nbsp; The rent of a small cottage which
produces one pound per annum, the origin of which is involved in
similar obscurity, is also applied to the same use.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aston</span>, a small township in the
parish of Claverley, is pleasantly situated about a mile east
from the parish church.&nbsp; At the census in 1841 there were 22
scattered houses and a population of 126 souls.&nbsp; Aston Hall,
a good brick house built in 1842, is the residence of John
Wilson, Esq.&nbsp; The old hall was formerly a seat of the
Brindleys, and their descendants the Skinners, men of high
consequence in the city of London.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Beobridge</span>, a township in the parish
of Claverley, is situated about a mile south from the parish
church, and in 1841 had eleven houses and sixty one
inhabitants.&nbsp; William Wilson, Esq., and Thomas H. Windle,
Esq., are the land owners.&nbsp; The acres and the tithes of the
several townships are included in the returns for the parish of
Claverley.&nbsp; The directories of the several townships will be
found alphabetically arranged after the township of
Claverley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Broughton</span> township and small
village is situated about a mile and a half south from Claverley,
and at the census of 1841 had twelve houses and eighty
inhabitants.&nbsp; There was a chapel here prior to the
reformation subject to the church of Claverley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dalicott</span>, a township in the parish
of Claverley, delightfully situated in a salubrious district
richly beautified with pastoral scenery, is about a mile and a
half north-west from the parish church.&nbsp; The land is the
property of George M. Kettle, Esq.&nbsp; At the census in 1841
there were three houses and twenty inhabitants.&nbsp; Dalicott
House is a pleasantly <a name="page468"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 468</span>situated mansion, commanding
extensive views over a luxuriant country of great diversity and
beauty; it is a handsome brick structure, the residence of George
Mackenzie Kettle, Esq.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Farmcott</span> township and small rural
village is situated about a mile south from Claverley, and in
1841 had 39 houses and 191 inhabitants.&nbsp; The land is the
property of Thomas Wilson, Esq.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gatacre</span>, a pleasantly situated
village and township in the parish of Claverley, in 1841
contained 23 houses and 125 inhabitants.&nbsp; The landowners are
Edward Lloyd Gatacre, Esq., and Edward Farrer Acton, Esq.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Gatacre Hall</span>, a well built and
commodious brick mansion delightfully situated, is the residence
of Edward Lloyd Gatacre, Esq., whose ancestors were seated here,
and in possession of the manor, in the reign of Edward the
Confessor.&nbsp; The ancient mansion, which was remarkable for
the peculiarity of its construction, has been taken down some
time.&nbsp; Camden, in speaking of this house, observes,
&ldquo;It was built of dark grey free stone coated with a green
vitrified substance about the thickness of a crown piece.&nbsp;
The hall was nearly exactly square, and most remarkably
constructed at each corner; in the middle of each side and in the
centre were immense oak trees hewn nearly square and without
branches, set with their heads on large stones laid about a foot
deep in the ground, and with their roots uppermost, which roots
with a few rafters formed a complete arched roof.&nbsp; The floor
was of oak boards three inches thick, not sawed but plain
chipped.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Gatacre Park</span>, a
handsome mansion, the seat and property of Edward Farrer Acton,
Esq., J.P., and deputy lieutenant of the county of Shropshire, is
a brick structure pleasantly situated, beautified with tasteful
pleasure grounds, and was erected during the year 1850.&nbsp; It
stands on the site of an ancient Elizabethan structure, which was
rased to the ground in 1849; it was in this house that the Earl
of Derby took shelter immediately after the battle of Worcester,
and shortly before he was brought to the scaffold in his way to
Newport.&nbsp; Several swords were found on taking down the
house, one of which is in a state of good preservation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Heathton</span>, a township and village in
the parish of Claverley, is situated about a mile and a half S.E.
by E. from the parish church.&nbsp; On the eastern verge of the
county is Long Common, which here divides Salop and
Staffordshire.&nbsp; Some remains of a military encampment may
still be traced upon this common, supposed to have been a Danish
fortification; about thirty years ago several skeletons were
discovered, and weapons of war have from time to time been
found.&nbsp; The township contains 840<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 32<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and at the census of 1841 had 52
houses and 208 inhabitants.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hopstone</span>, a township and village in
the parish of Claverley, is situated about a mile N. from the
parish church.&nbsp; At the census in 1841 there were 43 houses
and 188 inhabitants.&nbsp; G. M. Kettle, Esq., is the

family.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ludstone</span>, a township in the parish
of Claverley, situated about a mile N.E. from the parish church,
at the census in 1841 had 13 houses and a population of 95
souls.&nbsp; Ludstone was in early times part of the possessions
of the deans of Bridgnorth, but after the reformation was
purchased by the Leveson family, and now belongs to Thomas C.
Whitmore, Esq., and Mrs. Emma Fox.&nbsp; The manor house, now
Ludstone Hall, a curious and interesting structure of the
domestic architecture of by-gone days, was built in the early
part of the reign of Charles I., by the Whitmore family.&nbsp; It
is surrounded by a moat, and partly by a brick wall of about
eight feet in height.&nbsp; This was long the seat of a branch of
the Whitmore family; it is now occupied as a farm house by Mr.
William Stokes.&nbsp; In this township was born Sir Francis
Jones, Knight, whose family had an estate here till within the
last sixty years.&nbsp; Sir Francis Jones was of the
haberdasher&rsquo;s company, and lord mayor of London in
1620.&nbsp; Ludstone also gave birth to Richard Yate, an
ingenious poet, and almost self-taught scholar of great talents,
which he very frequently <a name="page469"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 469</span>displayed in the
<i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> from the year 1734 to 1767, and
generally on the most abstruse subjects.&nbsp; He was the
instructor of the Right Rev. Dr. Percy, late bishop of
Dromore.&nbsp; He died at Roughton in June, 1680, at the advanced
age of 82.&nbsp; On the south-east extremity of this manor lies
the Danesford Brook, so called from the marauding Danes, who were
in the habit of crossing this brook when they commenced their
summer incursions to the banks of the Severn, and passed over
carrying extermination and plunder into every part of the
county.</p>

<h3>DONINGTON</h3>
<p>is a parish in the Shiffnal division of the Brimstree hundred,
comprising 2,655 acres of land, and in 1801 had 289 inhabitants;
1831, 318; 1841, 380, and in 1851 81 houses and 352 inhabitants,
of whom 197 were males and 195 females.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;3,977.&nbsp; The chief landowners are George Jones, Esq.,
Francis Yates, Esq., and the Rev. Henry Edward John Howard, D.D.,
dean of Lichfield.&nbsp; Donington is situated about four and a
half miles S.E. from Shiffnal, and has a scattered population;
the houses are in general of brick, well built, and commodious,
and the cottages have a neat appearance.&nbsp; At the Doomsday
survey Earl Roger held <i>Donitone</i>, and there was then a mill
that rendered five horse load of corn, a wood a mile and a half
long, and half a mile broad, and in the Wyke there were five
salin&aelig; that paid 20s.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">This
Church</span> is a venerable structure, supposed to have been
built early in the fourteenth century; it consists of nave and
chancel, with a square tower, in which are two bells.&nbsp; <a
name="page471"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 471</span>The
interior has a neat appearance, and the pews are of oak.&nbsp;
The chancel is separated from the nave by a pointed arch, and the
windows are beautified with stained glass.&nbsp; The chancel
contains several memorials, among which is one to Edmund Waring,
Esq., who died on the 30th January, 1682&ndash;3, aged 63
years.&nbsp; A brass plate remembers John Chapman, formerly
rector of Donington, who died in 1607.&nbsp; The living is a
rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;5. 6s.
5&frac12;d., now returned at &pound;721, enjoyed by the Rev.
Henry Edward John Howard, D.D., dean of Lichfield, who resides at
the rectory, a spacious and handsome mansion of modern
construction, situated near the church.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Shakerley House</span>, a good brick house situated
about half a mile north from the church, is the residence and
property of George Jones, Esq., iron master, who is also a
considerable landowner in this parish.&nbsp; The mansion is
delightfully situated, and the pleasure grounds are tastefully
laid out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Sarah
Manning</i> charged her real estate in Shakerley with the payment
of 10s. annually to the poor of the parish of Donington.&nbsp;
From a deed in the possession of the owner of the Shakerley
estate, dated 3rd April, 1729, it appears that this annuity was
charged on a butt or section of land called Green Furlong,
adjoining to the Kilsale Green, and which was by the provisions
of that deed to be conveyed by Thomas Jellicorse and Jonathan
Ruston, the trustees therein named, after the death of Sarah
Manning, to William Bishton.&nbsp; What is the particular piece
of land subjected to this payment cannot now be ascertained, but
the amount is paid as a charge on the Shakerley estate.</p>
<p>The poor have also an annuity of 10s., as a portion of a rent
charge of 30s. per annum, given by Mr. Chapman, to be divided
between the poor of the parishes of Albrighton, Donington, and
Boningale, as stated in the account of the charities of
Albrighton.&nbsp; The owner of the Shakerley estate is not aware
in what manner the payment of that rent charge was apportioned,
so as to subject him to this share of it, but he considers it as
a general charge on the Shakerley estate, and pays it
accordingly.&nbsp; These two sums are distributed among the most
necessitous poor of the parish.</p>

473</span>SHIFFNAL,</h3>
<p>anciently called <span class="smcap">Idesall</span>, or <span
class="smcap">Idsal</span>, is a parish and market town the head
of a division of the Brimstree hundred, eight miles south from
Newport, ten miles north from Bridgnorth, and eighteen miles east
by south from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The town chiefly consists of one
street upwards of a mile in length, with several minor streets
diverging from it.&nbsp; The houses are irregularly built, and
many of the cottage residences have a mean appearance; there are
however several good inns and private houses, and a number of
respectable shops in most of the branches of the retail
trade.&nbsp; Though the situation of the town is low, it is built
on a dry sandy soil, and by no means unpleasant.&nbsp; According
to tradition Idesall was a place of more considerable note in
former times, and the principal portion of the town stood
westward of the church; foundations and traces of buildings have
frequently been discovered which would seem to confirm this
supposition.&nbsp; In the 9th of Edward II.&nbsp; Bartholomew de
Badlesmere obtained for him and his heirs a market on Monday and
Friday, and two fairs in the year, one on the eve of the day, and
the day after the feast of the Holy Trinity, and the other on the
eve, the day, and the morrow after Michaelmas, as also the
liberty of free warren in his demesnes in Ideshall, Adderley,
Sponley, Calverhall, and Shavington.&nbsp; He was one of those
mutinous lords who took part in the battle of Boroughbridge,
March 16th, 1322, where he was taken prisoner and afterwards
executed at Canterbury.&nbsp; The possessions of Bartholomew
Badlesmere were granted in the 15th of Edward II. to Edmund Earl
of Arundel and the heirs male of his body, but that noble lord
was in like manner attainted about four years after, and so we
find Giles de Badlesmere, son of the said Bartholomew, restored
to the inheritance of his family.&nbsp; In the 11th of Edward
IV., John Earl of Shrewsbury had a grant of a market and two
fairs at the Ville of Suffenhall.&nbsp; The market is still held
on Tuesday, but is not of much consideration; formerly corn was
sold to a considerable extent.&nbsp; Fairs are held on the first
Monday in April, August 5th, and November 22nd.&nbsp; The great
London and Holyhead road passes through the town, upon which
there were formerly seventeen coaches passing and repassing
daily, which, with other traffic, added much to the commercial
importance and advantage of Shiffnal.&nbsp; Although the
inhabitants have the facilities of railway communication and a
station in a central part of the town, this has rather had a
tendency to diminish the importance of Shiffnal, by diverting the
attention of parties who formerly frequented the market here to
places of more consideration at no great distance.</p>
<p>The parish contains 11,433 acres of land, of which 1,090 acres
are in woods and plantations, 74<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 28<span class="smcap">p</span>. in
roads and waste, and there are 60 acres of glebe.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;24,561. 16s.&nbsp; Population in 1801, 3,632; 1831,
4,779; 1841, 5,244; 1851, 5,616; of whom 2,820 were males, and
2,796 females; at the latter period there were 1,050
houses.&nbsp; The Marquis of Stafford is lord of the manor and a
very considerable landowner.&nbsp; The parish comprises four
divisions, viz.: that of Shiffnal, embracing the town and its
suburbs; Hatton district, comprising the hamlets of Idsal, Hem,
Wyke, Evelith, and Hinnington; Priors Lee, those of Snedshill,
Haughton, and Woodhouse; and the division of Woodside, containing
the hamlets of Crackley bank, Decker hill, the Lizzard, Aston,
Stanton, Upton, and Coppice green.&nbsp; The parish is
intersected by the London and Holyhead, Shiffnal and Bridgnorth,
and the Albrighton and Newport turnpike roads, and is watered by
the small streams of the Sal, Worfe, Cosford, and the
Lizzard.&nbsp; The township of Shiffnal contains 188<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 10<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and in 1841 had 412 houses and
1,872 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;4,153. 4s.&nbsp;
The principal freeholders are the Marquis of Stafford, W. H.
Slaney, Esq., William Cope, Esq., Mr. Edward Cherrington, and Mr.
Thomas Eaton Lander, besides whom there are between forty and
fifty small freeholders.&nbsp; The tithes were commuted in 1839,
when the rectoral tithes were apportioned as follows, viz:
&pound;923 to the Rev. John Brooke; &pound;580 to Henry Sidney
Herbert, Esq.; &pound;105 to the Duke of Cleveland; and &pound;26
to Messrs. John and George Pritchards.&nbsp; The vicarial tithes
are commuted for &pound;307.&nbsp; A considerable extent of land,
the property of the Duke of Cleveland, Lord Forester, R. A.
Slaney, Esq., Rev. John Brooke, and others, is tithe free, and
other portions of the parish pay a small modus.</p>
<p><a name="page474"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 474</span><span
class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Andrew, is a
large interesting cruciform structure, exhibiting various styles
of architecture, with a handsome square tower rising from the
centre and supported by four pointed arches resting on massive
pillars with ornamented capitals.&nbsp; The side aisles are
separated from the nave by four semi circular arches, and
terminated by side chapels.&nbsp; The chancel is spacious, and
was re-roofed a few years ago at the expense of the late vicar,
the Rev. John Brooke.&nbsp; The ceiling is of oak, and varnished,
which gives the venerable structure a very interesting
appearance.&nbsp; On the gallery at the west end is a fine toned
organ; a noble old window at the east end is beautifully
foliated.&nbsp; The altar is remarkably fine.&nbsp; Among the
numerous memorials is a magnificent altar tomb, having a full
length figure in a recumbent position, with the hands joined and
uplifted in prayer, in memory of Oliver Briggs, who died 20th
November, 1596.&nbsp; Another alabaster tomb of beautiful
workmanship, with the figure of a knight and his lady, remembers
Humphrey Briggs, Esq., and Ann, his wife, dated 1622.&nbsp; In a
niche in the wall is a full length figure of Thomas Forester,
some time prior of Wombridge, warden of Tong, and vicar of
Idesall, dated 1526.&nbsp; A splendid white tablet has been
erected to the memory of Dame Magdalene Briggs, who died
September 15th, 1698.&nbsp; There are also handsome tablets to
the Slaneys, Corbets, Pitts, Jackson, Charltons, and
Brookes.&nbsp; The memorial to George Brooke, Esq., of Haughton,
who died in 1776, is beautifully executed in free stone.&nbsp; A
neat marble tablet has been erected to the memory of Mary Bagott,
daughter of Ralph Clayton, of Sheffield, in the county of
Yorkshire; she died July 27th, 1748, aged 88 years.&nbsp; From
the inscription on the tablet to William Wakley, we learn that he
was baptised at Idsal, May 1st, 1590, and was buried November
28th, 1714, aged 124 years.&nbsp; He lived in the reigns of eight
kings and queens, viz., Elizabeth, James I., Charles I., Charles
II., James II., William and Mary, Anne, and George I.&nbsp; Mary,
wife of Joseph Yates, who died August 7th, 1776, aged 127 years;
she is stated to have married a third husband at the age of 92,
and to have been hearty and strong when 120 years old.&nbsp;
Besides which are recorded in the church yard many instances of
extreme longevity, for which this parish is peculiarly
eminent.&nbsp; The advowson of the church in early times was
granted to the abbey of Shrewsbury; in the 24th of Henry VI. the
impropriation was annexed to the college of Battlefield, near
Salop.&nbsp; The living is now a vicarage, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;15. 6s. 8d.; now returned at
&pound;492.; in the patronage of the Rev. John Brooke, of
Haughton Hall; incumbent, Rev. Townshend Brooke, M.A.&nbsp; <span

<p><span class="smcap">The Shiffnal Union House</span>, a brick
structure, situated a short distance from the town, was partly
built in 1817, at the expense of the ratepayers.&nbsp; In the
year 1840, additional buildings were erected by the guardians of
the union, at a cost of about &pound;800, which will accommodate
about one hundred and fifty inmates.&nbsp; The interior
arrangements are well contrived for the comfort, convenience, and
cleanliness of the inmates, the number of whom is usually about
sixty.&nbsp; The union comprises an area of sixty-seven square
miles, and embraces the parishes of Albrighton, Badger, Beckbury,
Boninghall, Donington, Kemberton, Ryton, Shiffnal, Stockton,
Sutton Maddock, and Tong, in the county of Salop; and the

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Shiffnal Free School</span>.&nbsp; The earliest
mention that we find of this school is contained in the will of
<i>John Aron</i>, dated 5th July, 1595, in which subject to
certain contingencies he gives the sum of &pound;20 towards
erecting a school house in Shiffnal.&nbsp; From the will of
<i>Gordian Strowbridge</i>, dated 22nd November, 1626, it appears
that a school house was there &ldquo;erected and set up&rdquo; in
the town, in which eight poor scholars were instructed to read
and write under the auspices of the testator; and for the
continuance of which number therein, after his death, he provides
by a legacy of &pound;50.&nbsp; But contemplating the possibility
of a cessation of the school in the house which had been so
erected, he in that event appoints the interest of the legacy to
other uses, one moiety to be given to any schoolmaster who should
teach a school either in the town or parish.&nbsp; An uncertain
or temporary interest in the building which had been there
erected would sufficiently explain the grounds of the
testator&rsquo;s apprehension that the school might cease to be
kept in it; and we are led to believe that such was the nature of
the interest which the charity at that time possessed, from the
testimony which we find subsequently recorded on the benefaction
table, that &ldquo;John Careswell, in 1652, gave the sum of
&pound;10, with which he purchased the school house for the use
of the inhabitants of the town and parish of
Shiffnal.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is probable, therefore, from this
recorded purchase, that we are to derive the title to the school
house which the town and parish now enjoy; although a later date
seems to be assigned to the present building or some part of it,
by an inscription in the year 1682, which appears upon one of its
walls.&nbsp; Of the legacy given by Gordian Strowbridge we do not
find any further mention, but it is supposed to have formed a
part of the consolidated charities hereafter mentioned.</p>
<p><i>Sir Humphrey Briggs</i>, <i>Bart.</i>, by deed dated 9th
November, 1652, granted to certain trustees all the tithes of
corn, grain, and hay, coming within the titheable places of the
township of Hem, on trust for the security of the payment, among
other things, of the sum of &pound;1. 13s. 4d. out of the profit
of the premises to the schoolmaster of Shiffnal.</p>
<p><i>Eliazer Careswell</i>, by will, 1675, gave to certain
trustees an annuity or rent charge of 48s., to be for ever
issuing out of a tenement and lands within the manor of Shiffnal,
<a name="page478"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 478</span>and
directed the same to be paid half yearly to some schoolmaster or
schoolmistress for the education of six poor boys.&nbsp; The sum
of &pound;2. 4s. is all that is at present paid in respect of
this annuity, nor do we find that more has been received for a
considerable period.&nbsp; It seems probable that the 4s. were
deducted under the provisions of the land tax act.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Consolidated
Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Robert Sidney</i>, in 1677, in
consideration of the sum of &pound;200, which money had been
given by ten several donors for charitable uses, granted a rent
charge of &pound;10 per annum, to be issuing out of his manor of
Grindle, as to 10s. of it for the payment of the Tenstree rent,
the residue thereof to be applied in apprentice fees, and other
charitable uses.&nbsp; On the 15th August, 1761, at a general
meeting held in the parish church, the vicar, churchwardens,
overseers, and others, signed a written declaration in the parish
book, testifying that they thereby assigned the annuity so
charged for the use of the schoolmaster in consideration of his
teaching six additional children to read and write.&nbsp; In
consequence of this proceeding the master has since continued to
receive this annuity, which, with the respective annuities of
&pound;1. 13s. 4d. and &pound;2. 4s., constituted the whole of
his income down to the year 1816, in which year it was resolved
to adopt the national system of education, and with the interest
of a legacy amounting to &pound;4. 10s., and funds raised by
subscriptions, the annual income now amounts to about
&pound;40.</p>
<p><i>Careswell&rsquo;s Exhibitions</i>.&mdash;The particulars of
this endowment will be found noticed with the account of the free
grammar school at Bridgnorth, where it will be seen that three
scholars of the free school at Shiffnal are eligible to
exhibitions at Christ College, Oxford.&nbsp; It does not appear
that the free school, properly so called, has ever participated
in the benefit of these exhibitions, not having at any time
included classical instruction in its course of education.&nbsp;
But it seems that the practice has been to elect the
exhibitioners from a private classical school kept in the town of
Shiffnal&mdash;a practice probably grounded upon the provision
which extended the benefit of the endowment to scholars not free
of the school.&nbsp; We conceive (observe the charity
commissioners) that the true meaning of that provision was to
include the private scholars of the master of the free school,
and not the scholars of any other school, having no connection or
communication with the free school.&nbsp; Such, however, as far
as we can trace it, appears to have been the character of the
classical school to which we have alluded, into which if any
scholars were ever admitted from the free school, it was not as
free scholars, but on payment of the same price, and subject to
the same conditions that were required from the other
scholars.&nbsp; It appears indeed that the master of this school
received a formal appointment as classical tutor of the free
school from the minister, trustees, and principal inhabitants of
Shiffnal; but he was at the same time exempted from affording any
tuition or discharging any duties towards the free school, other
than preparing for Christ Church such exhibitioners as came
forward as candidates agreeably to the provisions made for them
in Mr. Careswell&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; The duty, therefore, which
he thus engaged to perform, appears to have been simply to
receive and instruct such of the free scholars of the free school
as should be able to pay that price, and comply with these
conditions.&nbsp; We cannot but think that a more important
benefit to the free school was contemplated by the founder of
these exhibitions, who in extending the benefit to scholars not
free of the school, probably intended to provide for a classical
master such a source of remuneration from private scholars as
should entitle the free scholars gratuitously to participate in
the advantages of his instruction.</p>
<p><i>Richard Bennet</i>, in 1794, bequeathed &pound;100 upon
trust, and directed the interest or proceeds thereof to be paid
to the master of the free school.&nbsp; The interest, &pound;4.
10s., is now paid to the master of the national school.</p>
<p><i>Beatrice Jobber</i>, in 1716, bequeathed &pound;200, and
directed the interest to be applied in clothing and instructing
six poor children, daughters of widows or other poor persons
belonging to the parish of Shiffnal.</p>
<p><a name="page479"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 479</span><span
class="smcap">Dole Charities</span>.&mdash;It is recorded in an
old book belonging to the trustees of the poor&rsquo;s stock, and
purporting to contain an account of the charities of this parish,
that in 1506, Sir John Leigh, a priest who had long served in the
church of Wolverhampton, gave &pound;12. 13s. 4d. to purchase a
mark a year, to be given to the poor of Shiffnal.&nbsp; An
annuity of 13s. 4d., which has long been received for the use of
the poor, appears to be charged upon certain premises in
Pipers-row, Wolverhampton.</p>
<p><i>Sir Humphrey Briggs</i>, in 1652, left a rent charge of
40s. per annum, to be distributed by the churchwardens and
overseers among the poor of the parish.</p>
<p><i>Arthur Mainwaring</i>, in 1690, gave four butts of ground
lying in Churchfield and Wykefield, within the parish of
Shiffnal, to Mary, his wife, and Ann, his daughter, and their
heirs for ever, on trust, to pay 20s. yearly on the feast of St.
Andrew, to forty poor old people belonging the parish.</p>
<p><i>Vincent Latham</i> gave &pound;20 for the use of the
poor.&nbsp; In respect of this gift there is now a rent charge of
20s. per annum, issuing out of a certain tenement in High-street,
which is divided among the poor on the feast of St. Andrew.</p>
<p><i>William Smith</i>, in 1713, gave &pound;10 to the poor of
Shiffnal, and directed the interest to be distributed among poor
widows who do not receive parochial relief.</p>
<p><i>Edward Revell</i>, by deed, 1693, assigned to certain
trustees a bond which had been made to him for the payment of
&pound;200, with lawful interest, in trust, for the benefit of
the poor.&nbsp; The bond which was thus assigned appears to have
been discharged in 1698, and &pound;100 of the money, after
passing successively through several hands at interest, was in
1847 given to Humphrey Pitt, Esq.&nbsp; John Revell, in 1723,
gave &pound;100 for charitable uses; this, it appears, eventually
also came into the hands of Mr. Pitt, and at his death in 1769 it
was found necessary to institute a suit against his
representatives for the recovery of the money due from his
estate.&nbsp; An arrangement afterwards took place, by which it
was agreed that the sum of &pound;312 should be paid to the
trustees, in full of all principal and interest then due, of
which &pound;12 was immediately distributed among the poor, and
the remaining &pound;300 was placed out at interest.&nbsp; The
other &pound;100 left by Edward Revell, above mentioned, after
being held by the Phillip&rsquo;s family, came into the
possession of George Appleby, Esq., in whose hands the above
&pound;300 was also placed, and who paid interest at the rate of
five per cent. for the same till the year 1804, when the
principal was transferred to George Brooke, Esq., who gave a
promissory note for the security of the same, and pays interest
at the rate of five per cent.&nbsp; This money, with other
charities previously noticed, produces a yearly income of
&pound;25. 3s. 4d., which, with other monies furnished by
voluntary contributions, is distributed at Christmas in small
sums among the poor.</p>
<p><i>Reginal Piper</i>, in 1659, granted to the churchwardens of
Shiffnal a rent charge of 10s. issuing out of his messuage in the
Sheep market, and directed the same to be disposed of among
twenty poor old people.</p>
<p><i>Henry Green</i>, in 1702, granted to trustees a rent charge
of 20s. per annum, to be disposed of on Good Fridays and
Christmas-days among poor widows.</p>
<p><i>Frances Moreton</i>, in 1781, devised to her nephew, John
Brooke, a piece of land, called Aston Croft, in trust, to permit
the vicar of the parish to dispose of the rents and profits among
poor housekeepers.&nbsp; By indenture, dated 5th of May, 1788,
reciting the abovementioned will, and that the said Frances
Moreton had no power to devise the said land, the same descending
to Sarah Atkis, as heir-at-law of Robert Moreton, deceased; the
said <i>Sarah Atkis</i> conveyed to trustees the plot of land
called Aston Croft, to permit the vicar to take the rents
thereof, and during the life of Mary Stockwell, to apply a part,
and after her decease, the whole of the profits amongst decayed
housekeepers.&nbsp; The land, about the year 1806, was exchanged
for 3<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>.
12<span class="smcap">p</span>. situate at Aston, in the parish
of Shiffnal, which now produces a rent of &pound;12 per
annum.&nbsp; The amount is distributed at Christmas eve among
poor widows or other indigent persons, in sums varying from 4s.
to 10s. each, according to their several necessities.</p>
<p><a name="page480"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
480</span><i>Sir Humphrey Briggs</i>, by a deed, dated 9th of
November, 1652, charged the tithes of Shiffnal with the payment
of &pound;1. 6s. 8d. to the clerk or deacon of the parish.&nbsp;
<i>Francis Mallard</i> and <i>Elizabeth</i>, his wife, in 1587,
left an annuity of 16s. for the benefit of the poor.&nbsp; This

<h3>STOCKTON</h3>
<p>is a parish and village on the turnpike road from Bridgnorth
to Shiffnal, five miles N.N.E. from the former town and five
miles S.E. from the latter.&nbsp; At the census in 1801 there
were 409 inhabitants; 1831, 459; 1841, 422, and in 1851 88 houses
and 479 inhabitants, of whom 237 were males and 242
females.&nbsp; The parish embraces the hamlets of Apley, Higford,
Norton, and part of Cheswardine-lane, and contains 3,162<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 21<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, of which 1,065<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 37<span
class="smcap">p</span>. are in Apley; the park and pleasure
grounds contain 484 acres, and there are 79<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 19<span
class="smcap">p</span>. in the red deer park.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;4,262. 17s.&nbsp; The soil is various, in some
parts a light loam upon a red sand prevails, in other parts the
soil is strong, and in some places there is a mixture of
gravel.&nbsp; The strong soil yields fine crops of barley and
wheat, the meadow lands on the banks of the Severn produce a fine
herbage, and is highly fertile.&nbsp; Considerable flocks of
sheep are kept in this parish.&nbsp; Thomas Charlton Whitmore,
Esq., M.P., is lord of the manor, and owner of the whole
parish.&nbsp; The vicinity of Stockton is pleasingly diversified
with hill and dale, and beautified with romantic scenery; the
high grounds command some fine views of the distant country, and
the woody scenery in the immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp; Within
the last few years several handsome residences have been erected,
and some of the older houses have been modernized and
beautified.&nbsp; The farms in this parish are of considerable
extent, and by a judicious outlay of capital and superior
management have been brought to a state of high
productiveness.&nbsp; A court leet and court baron is held every
five years at the Hundred House Inn, Norton.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Chad,
is a venerable structure of free stone, (some portions of which
have been rough cast,) consisting of nave and chancel, with a
square tower, in which are five bells and a clock; the ceiling is
of panelled oak, with projecting rests, on which are carved
figures of the twelve apostles; the ceiling of the chancel is
also of beautiful dark oak, and the pulpit and reading desk are
elaborately carved.&nbsp; The living is a rectory, with the
curacy of Boningale annexed, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at
&pound;13. 11s. 3d., in the patronage of Thomas Charlton
Whitmore, Esq., and incumbency of the Rev. Charles Blaney
Cavendish Whitmore, M.A.; the Rev. Stutville Isaacson, M.A., is
the officiating minister.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for
&pound;635. 15s., and there are 184<span class="smcap">a</span>.
2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 26<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
glebe land.&nbsp; The rectory is a commodious brick structure
pleasantly situated a short distance from the church.&nbsp; There
is a commodious school and residence for the teachers at Norton,
which is supported by the munificence of T. C. Whitmore,
Esq.&nbsp; At the present time there are about one hundred
children instructed in this school.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apley Park</span> is the magnificent seat
of Thomas Charlton Whitmore, Esq., M.P. for the borough of
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; The mansion is an elegant structure of the
Grinshill free stone, in the castellated style of architecture,
with polygonal turrets at the angles, and a porch of three arches
at the entrance of the eastern front.&nbsp; A lofty square tower
ornaments the centre of the southern front, and on the north is a
domestic chapel.&nbsp; It stands on a gentle eminence, and
exhibits a noble specimen of architectural skill and superb
workmanship, and may justly be considered one of the most costly
and splendid mansions in the county of Shropshire.&nbsp; The
terrace is one of the most extensive and delightful in the
kingdom, and commands fine views over a park richly adorned with
sylvan beauty and stocked with red deer; the windings of the
Severn, whose silvery waters are seen through the rich foliage,
forming an interesting object in the views.&nbsp; The <a
name="page485"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 485</span>gardens,
pleasure grounds, greenhouses, and vineries are extensive, and
stocked with a profusion of the choicest flowers and rare plants,
which exhibit a luxuriance and beauty that show them to be under
the management of a skilled gardener.&nbsp; This manor before the
reign of Henry III. belonged to the family of Huggeford, from
whom it passed in marriage to Sir Thomas Lucy.&nbsp; Its
proprietor, Sir Thomas Lucy, disposed of the manors of Stockton,
Apley, and Huggeford, and the estates within the parish, with the
advowson of the church of Stockton, in 1551, to William Whitmore,
Esq., of Oxton, near London,&mdash;a gentleman whose ancestors
had long been resident at Whitmore, in the parish of
Claverley.&nbsp; The above William Whitmore was a merchant who
had acquired an immense fortune by trading with Spain in fine
cloth, being a freeman of the Haberdashers&rsquo; Company,
London.&nbsp; The abundant wealth of this great merchant laid the
foundation of the future prospects of this respectable family,
who soon after increased their possessions around their ancient
patrimony, as well as in many other counties in the
kingdom.&nbsp; Sir George Whitmore, Knight, the second son of the
above William, was Lord Mayor of London in 1632.&nbsp; Sir
William Whitmore, Knight, of Apley, was sheriff in this county in
1620, in which year he was elected member of parliament for
Bridgnorth, of which borough his successors, the Whitmores, of
Apley, have almost uniformly been representatives.&nbsp; The
Whitmores were distinguished for their loyalty and sufferings in
the troublous times of the great rebellion; and among the
gentlemen of this county who compounded for the estates during
the commonwealth, we find Sir Thomas Apley, of Whitmore, paid
&pound;5,000.&nbsp; Apley House was besieged by the parliamentary
forces under Sir John Price, when Sir W. Whitmore and his son,
Sir Francis Oateley, Mr. Owen, Mr. Fowler, Mr. Griffiths, and
about sixty soldiers were taken prisoners.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The South Lodge</span> at Norton is the
residence of William H. Austin, Esq., a neat and pleasantly
situated mansion, beautified with tasteful pleasure grounds.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Mr. Thomas
Talbot</i>, in 1678, bequeathed &pound;34 for the use of the poor
of the parish of Stockton, the interest to be expended in
bread.&nbsp; <i>John Gough</i> gave &pound;30, and directed the
yearly produce to be expended in bread, and given among six poor
people.&nbsp; This legacy, as well as Talbots, was placed on
private security in the hands of Mr. Thomason, who gave his note
of hand for the same.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. Eleanor Church</i>, in 1798,
gave to the churchwardens of Stockton &pound;20, the interest to
be given to the poor of the parish in bread on the first Sunday
after the 26th of May.&nbsp; This money was also lent to Mr.
Thomason.&nbsp; The interest of these three legacies now forms
one fund for the distribution of bread, amounting to &pound;4.
4s. a year.&nbsp; The annual cost of the loaves distributed when
the charity commissioners published their report was &pound;3.
9s. 4d.&nbsp; It did not appear why the whole of the interest had
not been yearly expended, but the party holding the money agreed
to pay up the principal, which it was intended to deposit in the
Bridgnorth Savings&rsquo; Bank.</p>
<p>An omnibus leaves the Hundred House Inn twice a day, for the
conveyance of passengers to and from the station at Shiffnal, and
to Bridgnorth.</p>

<h3>SUTTON MADDOCK</h3>
<p>parish is situated in the Shiffnal division of the Brimstree
hundred, and comprises 3,240 acres of land, the rateable value of
which is &pound;4,042.&nbsp; The arable lands are highly fertile,
and the grazing lands produce a fine herbage.&nbsp; The village
is pleasantly situated on the Bridgnorth and Shiffnal turnpike
road, six miles north from the former, and five miles south-west
from the latter.&nbsp; At the census in 1801 there were 400
inhabitants; 1831, 384; and in 1841, 79 houses and a population
of 352 souls.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Richard
Phillips, Esq., Brockton Hall; T. C. Whitmore, Esq.; Richard
Phillips, gentleman; Mr. William Wilkinson; Mr. William Braidley;
and the Rev. John Brooke; there are also several other smaller
proprietors.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a
freestone structure, dedicated to St. Mary, and consists of nave
and chancel, with a tower, in which are five bells.&nbsp; The
tower appears much older than the body of the church, which has
in all probability been re-built, but of which we find no
historical record.&nbsp; There is a small organ placed upon the
gallery.&nbsp; A neat memorial remembers Elizabeth Farmer, of
this place, who died on the 16th December, 1827, aged thirty
years; there is also a neat tablet in memory of William Jones,
late of Harrington, in this parish, who died in 1823, and various
others.&nbsp; This church was given to the priory of Wombridge by
King Henry II.&nbsp; The living is a discharged vicarage, annexed
to the rectory of Kemberton.&nbsp; The Rev. George Whitmore,
M.A., is the incumbent.&nbsp; In the 15th of Henry III., Madoc,
the son of Griffin, held Sutton by knights&rsquo; service.&nbsp;
From this person it acquired the name of Sutton Madoc, now
corrupted to Sutton Maddock.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Brockton</span> is a hamlet in this parish,
pleasantly situated on the turnpike road from Shiffnal to
Bridgnorth, about a mile north from the parish church.&nbsp; It
contains several good family mansions.&nbsp; The noble family of
Sutton de Dudley are said to be descended from the Suttons of
Sutton Maddock.</p>

<h3>TONG, <span class="GutSmall">OR</span> TONGE,</h3>
<p>is a parish in the Shiffnal division of the Brimstree hundred,
comprising 3,464<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 37<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
mostly a strong loamy soil.&nbsp; The woodlands cover one hundred
and twenty acres.&nbsp; At the census in 1801 there were 404
inhabitants; 1831, 510; and in 1841, 115 houses and a population
of 566 souls.&nbsp; Rateable value of the parish, &pound;4,505.
1s.&nbsp; The village of Tong is of considerable antiquity, and
is delightfully situated in a fertile district richly beautified
with picturesque scenery, three and a half miles east by south
from Shiffnal, and ten miles south-east from Wolverhampton,
George Charles Selwyn Durant, Esq., is the principal landowner
and lord of the manor.&nbsp; The Earl of Bradford, Mrs. Celeste
Durant, and Mr. Jones, are also proprietors.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Tong Castle</span> is stated to have been in
ancient times the seat of <a name="page487"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 487</span>Hengist the Saxon, whom Vortigern
the British king called in to his assistance; and having been
successful in his warlike engagements, he afterwards begged of
Vortigern as much land as an ox-hide would inclose.&nbsp; On his
request being granted, he cut the ox-hide into small thongs, and
had as much land as it encompassed, whereon he built a
castle.&nbsp; The present castle is a magnificent structure,
erected in the last century by George Durant, Esq., on the site
of the old castle, which he purchased in 1764, and
demolished.&nbsp; The architecture is a fantastic mixture of
Gothic and Moorish, and though bad in detail, the effect produced
is strikingly grand, arising from the numerous turrets and
pinnacles, the rich colour of the stone, the wide extent, and
stately crown given to the whole by two lofty and magnificent
Turkish domes.&nbsp; It is beautifully situated in a fine
champaign country, watered by a serpentine river which flows
through the grounds, and passes close to the castle.&nbsp; The
park comprises 319<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 19<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
and is finely wooded with venerable timber.&nbsp; The castle is
now occupied by two female servants, the owner, G. C. S. Durant,
Esq., being abroad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St.
Bartholomew, stands within the fine demesne of Tong Castle, and
is a spacious and beautiful structure in the pointed style of the
fourteenth century, consisting of nave, side aisles, choir,
chancel, and side chapel.&nbsp; From the centre rises a handsome
but singular tower.&nbsp; Immediately above the roof it is
square; on it rests an octagonal bell-story, which is lengthened
in a chastely-executed and lofty spire, about half-way up adorned
with pinnacles, springing as it were out of the shaft.&nbsp; The
nave is divided from the side aisles by three handsome pointed
arches, with clustered pillars on each side.&nbsp; The tower
contains a peal of eight musical bells, besides the great bell of
Tong, and is ornamented with a clock and sun-dial.&nbsp; It is
supported by four lofty pointed arches, rising from clustered
pillars enriched with Gothic tracery.&nbsp; The ceiling is of
dark oak, and the pews and reading desk are of the same material,
the latter exhibiting some fine carving.&nbsp; The rood loft or
screen is nearly perfect, and embellished with much carving; the
choir is small, and contains eight stalls on each side, of
beautiful workmanship.&nbsp; The east window is beautifully
foliated, and a portion of it ornamented with stained glass, and
underneath is the communion table, which is of alabaster; a
remarkable old font exhibits some fine chiselling.&nbsp;
Adjoining the south aisle is a beautiful chantry chapel, erected
by Sir Henry Vernon, in 1515; the roof is of groined freestone,
having a profusion of delicate ribs and centre pendants.&nbsp;
The windows are richly adorned with stained glass.&nbsp; The tomb
of Sir Henry Vernon, Knight, is in the wall which separates the
chapel from the church.&nbsp; It has the figure of a knight and
his lady in a recumbent posture.&nbsp; Over this is a fine open
screen, rising about ten feet; on the divisions are four rich
tabernacles, with the original painting and gilding, but bereaved
of their statues.&nbsp; Within the area of the tower are four
superb monuments, with recumbent figures on altar tombs, all of
alabaster, highly adorned with elaborate workmanship, in memory
of the Pembruges and Vernons.&nbsp; It appears the former family
possessed the castle and estates of Tong as early as the year
1280.&nbsp; In the south aisle is a magnificent tomb, with the
full length figure of a knight and his lady, in memory of the
Hon. Thomas Stanley, second son of the Earl of Derby, and
Margaret his wife, dated 1576, and has the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ask who lies here, but do not weep;<br />
Hee is not dead, he do but sleep,<br />
This stonie register is for his bones,<br />
His fame is more perpetual than these stones;<br />
And his own goodness with himself being gone,<br />
Shall live when earthlie monument is none.</p>
<p>Not monumental stone preserves our fame,<br />
Nor skie-aspiring pyramids our name;<br />
<a name="page488"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 488</span>The
memory of him for whom this stands,<br />
Shall outlive marble and defacer&rsquo;s hands.<br />
When all to time&rsquo;s consumption shall be given,<br />
Stanley, for whom this stands, shall stand in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a canopied niche is a carved figure, beautifully executed
in basso-relievo, in memory of Mrs. Wylde, one of the
co-heiresses of Sir Thomas Harris, Bart., the owner of Tong
Castle and domain, which he purchased from the Stanley family
about the year 1610.&nbsp; Near to the pulpit is an alabaster
tomb, of superb workmanship, with two figures representing a
knight and his lady with hands joined in the attitude of prayer,
remembering Richard Yernon, of Nether Haddon, and his wife
Margaret.&nbsp; The former died in 1557, and the latter in the
year 1500.&nbsp; On the opposite side is a large monumental tomb
of grey marble, the top of which is inlaid with brass figures,
and dated 1460.&nbsp; This also remembers a branch of the Vernon
family.&nbsp; A neat tablet of white marble has been erected over
the vestry door to the memory of Elizabeth Pierpoint, only
daughter of Gervaise Pierpoint, Esq., the grandson of Robert
Pierpoint, Earl of Kingston, a gallant soldier who fell a victim
to loyalty in defending his prince, King Charles I.&nbsp; He was
descended from Robert de Pierpoint, a companion-in-arms of
William the Conqueror, whose family is still extant in
Normandy.&nbsp; On the north side of the altar is a sumptuous
pyramidal monument of white marble on a black ground, in memory
of George Durant, Esq., and several other members of that
family.&nbsp; A splendid marble monument also remembers George
Durant, Esq., who died November 29th, 1844, aged 69 years.&nbsp;
On the left of the altar is a grey marble monument to the memory
of William Skeffington, Esq., of the White Ladies, who died in
1550.&nbsp; From the crest and armorial bearings, he would appear
to have descended from the ancient family of Massarene.&nbsp;
Gervaise Lord Pierpoint is interred in a family vault under the
communion table.&nbsp; He died May 22nd, 1715, aged 66
years.&nbsp; Thomas Stanley, Esq., and his wife lie in the same
vault.&nbsp; There are many other interesting tablets and
memorials, which our limits will not allow us to notice.&nbsp;
The great bell in this church was given by Sir Henry Vernon,
Knt., in 1518.&nbsp; It was broken by the Parliamentary forces in
the troublesome times of King Charles I., and recast at the
expense of the parish in 1720.&nbsp; The bell remained entire
till the first Wednesday in Lent, 1849, when it cracked while
tolling for divine service.&nbsp; It is stated that nine persons
may comfortably stand under this bell at the same time.</p>
<p>King Henry IV., in 1411, in consideration of &pound;40 granted
to Isabel, relict of Sir Fulke de Pembrugge, Knt., the liberty of
purchasing of the abbot and convent of Shrewsbury, the advowson
and patronage of the church of St. Bartholomew, at Tong, then
holden of the king in capite, paying an annual pension of 6s. 8d.
to the monastery of Salop; and further, that the said church
should be erected into a college, consisting of five chaplains,
one whereof to be custos or warden of the college.&nbsp; The duty
of the warden and fellows was to pray for the souls of the king
and of his brother, Thomas de Beaufort, and for the soul of the
said Isabel.&nbsp; The endowments, besides the provision for the
warden and fellows, were to be applied for the maintenance and
support of thirteen decrepid old men.&nbsp; The priory of Lapley,
anciently a cell of the convent of Rheimes, seized by King Edward
III. as an alien priory, was annexed to this foundation.&nbsp;
The statutes and ordinances of the college, confirmed by the
Bishop of Coventry, were to this effect:&mdash;That none of the
fellows should be capable of any other ecclesiastical preferment,
except the master; that the master was to have a man and a pair
of horses kept at the expense of the college, to travel about the
business of the fraternity&mdash;but, if occasion required it, he
might keep more horses; that the warden was excusable from
constant residence, but with the restriction not to be absent
more than two months in the year, and if longer his salary was to
be applied to the use of the college; that whoever of the fellows
were absent from mass should forfeit one penny.&nbsp; Every
Sunday the mass of the <a name="page489"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 489</span>Holy Ghost was to be celebrated for
the founders and benefactors; on Mondays the mass of the Holy
Ghost; on Tuesdays, Salus Populi, or the mass for the salvation
of all men; on Wednesdays, the angels&rsquo; mass; on Thursdays,
the mass de Corpore Christi; on Fridays, the mass of the Holy
Ghost; and on Saturdays, the mass of rest.&nbsp; That whoever was
guilty of adultery, incest, perjury, sacrilege, robbery, after
penance done for the first offence, he was to take an oath not to
commit the like crime again, and if convicted the second time, to
be expelled the house.&nbsp; The church living is a perpetual
curacy, in the patronage of G. C. S. Durant, Esq.; incumbent,
Rev. George Shipton Harding, M.A.&nbsp; The rectoral tithes have
been commuted, and &pound;391. 1s. 10d. apportioned to the
impropriators.&nbsp; The incumbent receives &pound;80 per annum,
with parsonage, and 2<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 37<span class="smcap">p</span>. of glebe
land.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Gervaise Lord
Pierpoint</i>, by indenture of the 23rd of October, 1697, granted
to trustees all the tithes (except the tithes of corn and grain)
yearly growing within the parish of Tong, and also six several
annuities or yearly rents of &pound;30, &pound;14, &pound;6,
&pound;12, &pound;12, and &pound;10, making together &pound;84
per annum, to be issuing out of the manor of Tong, on trust, as
to the said tithes and the several annuities of &pound;30,
&pound;14, and &pound;6, to permit the minister or curate to
enjoy the same; one of the annuities of &pound;12 to be
distributed among the six poor widows in the almshouses; and the
other &pound;12 to be expended in purchasing Stafford shalloon,
and setting to work the poor people of Tong in manufacturing the
same into cloth, part thereof to be made into six gowns for the
said poor widows, and the remainder to be applied in clothing the
necessitous poor; the residue &pound;10 to be disposed of in
buying hemp and flax and setting the poor at work in
manufacturing it into cloth, and after selling the same, to apply
the proceeds in putting forth poor children apprentices.&nbsp;
Lord Pierpoint granted a further annuity of &pound;30, to be also
issuing out of the manor of Tong, on trust, to permit the
minister to receive and enjoy the same from such time as he could
not (without covin or neglect on his part) have and enjoy the
said tithes; but the minister was not to enjoy the tithes and
last mentioned annuity at the same time.&nbsp; The minister had
also the privilege of holding a certain chamber in the castle of
Tong, as the same was then furnished with books and presses,
together with the free use of the said books; and also stabling
for one horse, and the privilege of depasturing it for a certain
time in Tong Park.&nbsp; And for the better assuring the
performances of the several grants, Lord Pierpoint granted to the
trustees three other annuities of &pound;5. 40s., and 40s. to be
for ever issuing out of the manor, castle, and premises, and to
be respectively forfeited, and to continue payable so long as the
minister should not enjoy the said chamber, stabling, and
pasture, respectively.</p>
<p>By an indenture of the 11th of August, 1725, in which it is
recited, that the premises charged had descended to Evelyn Duke
of Kingston, upon the death of Lord Pierpoint; and that the
Castle of Tong had been a long time uninhabited and Tong Park
disparked and inclosed, and that the said duke, at his own
charge, built with brick a strong handsome and convenient house
in Tong, with a room for a library, and stable and hayloft, and
other conveniences, for the habitation of the minister, and had
delivered the books to him and his successors; so that the
covenants made by Lord Pierpoint in respect of the room and
library in Tong Castle, and the stabling and depasturing, were
become unnecessary, and the several annuities granted for
enforcing the specific performance thereof should therefore be
repealed; and that the common fields in Tong having been inclosed
and converted into pasture, the revenue of tithes granted to the
minister had been reduced to &pound;12 per annum, but that the
duke was willing, on condition that the said small tithes should
be invested in him and his heirs, to be discharged from the
trust; that the said annuity of &pound;30 should be absolutely
and indefeasibly settled and assured to the said minister and his
successors for ever; which, together with the several annuities
of &pound;30, &pound;14, and &pound;6, make &pound;80 per
annum.&nbsp; And after reciting that the said duke and the late
Lord Pierpoint had for a long time paid &pound;4 a year for
maintaining a schoolmaster, <a name="page490"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 490</span>the said duke for perpetuating the
charily, conveyed a messuage, situated near the west end of the
church, then used as a school-house, in trust, to permit the same
to be occupied as a school for teaching ten poor boys within the
parish of Tong to read, and granted a rent charge of &pound;4 per
annum, issuing out of the manor of Tong, to be paid to the
schoolmaster.&nbsp; The library above mentioned, which is
understood to have been augmented by Mr. Peitier, was removed
several years ago to the vestry room.</p>
<p>It appears that shortly after the late Mr. Durant came into
the possession of the estate, the old almshouse and school-house
were taken down, and new ones built by that gentleman on other
sites.&nbsp; It is stated that the old buildings had become too
dilapidated to admit of any effectual repairs, and that Mr.
Durant having, under these circumstances, conceived the idea of
erecting new buildings, was induced to select new situations as
better suited for the purpose; and the charity has derived much
advantage from the change.&nbsp; But it is to be observed that no
regular transfer of the new premises was ever made to the
trustees, an omission it appears desirable to supply.&nbsp; In
the year 1802, the almshouse having grown much in need of repair,
the sum of &pound;102, from the funds of a charity to be
presently adverted to, was applied to that purpose; since which
time the repairs have been kept up at the expense of the parish,
aided by the voluntary contributions of Mr. Durant.&nbsp; The
inmates of the almshouses each receive &pound;3 quarterly, and
occasionally other benefactions.&nbsp; The ruins of the old
hospital are still to be seen.</p>
<p>By an indenture dated 31st May, 1734, it is recited that the
sum of &pound;100 was given by the late Lady Harris, for the use
of the poor of the parish; the sum of &pound;200 was likewise
bequeathed by Lady Pierpoint, and a sum of &pound;100 was given
by Lewis Peitier, minister of Tong, and party to the said
indenture, making in the whole the sum of &pound;400, which was
laid out in the purchase of certain premises in Albrighton,
called the New Lands and the Hawklees, containing 30<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">p</span>., now producing &pound;45 per annum.&nbsp;
In 1781 a sale of timber from this farm produced the sum of
&pound;100, which in 1802 was applied to the repairs of the
almshouse granted by the Duke of Kingston.&nbsp; In the year 1814
&pound;100 was laid out in the purchase of a cottage and 1<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land in Horsebrook, which is now let
for &pound;10 10s. per annum; the rent of the last mentioned
premises is apportioned to the schoolmaster, who has also
&pound;10 from the farm at Albrighton, and &pound;4 from the
manor of Tong, making altogether the sum of &pound;24. 10s., with
the additional benefit of a house and garden from the charity of
the Duke of Kingston, in consideration of which the children are
taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, and they are furnished
with the necessary books and clothing from the charity.&nbsp; The
master has also &pound;5 per annum for teaching a Sunday
school.&nbsp; The portion of income which is allotted for general
distribution is laid out in the purchase of warm clothing, which
is given to the poor during the winter season.</p>
<p>A feast is held at Tong on the Sunday before St.
Matthew&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; Mr. Durant&rsquo;s agent at the
present time is holder of four of the largest farms in the

<h3>WORFIELD</h3>
<p>is an extensive parish in a delightful and salubrious part of
the county, watered by the meandering stream of the Worf.&nbsp;
The land exhibits inequalities of surface, and bold swells, which
in some instances rise to a considerable height, from whence most
beautiful and varied prospects over a luxuriant country are
seen.&nbsp; The soil is variable, the arable lands produce good
wheat, turnips, and barley, and the meadows and grazing lands are
highly fertile.&nbsp; The farms in most instances are large, and
the houses in general are good residences, with conveniently
arranged out premises.&nbsp; Several ancient dwellings have been
taken down, and handsome villa residences erected in their
place.&nbsp; The cottages are for the most part well built, and
in most instances have small allotments of garden ground.&nbsp;
The parish comprises 10,314 acres of land, and at the census in
1801 had 1,354 inhabitants; 1831, 1,676, and in 1841 there were
357 houses and 1,643 souls.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;16,145.
19s. 9d.&nbsp; Thomas Charlton Whitmore, Esq., M.P., of Apley
Park, and William S. Davenport, Esq., are the principal
landowners; the two former, with Mrs. Bache, are joint lords of
the manor.&nbsp; The parish contains the following hamlets or
townships for highway purposes, viz., Ackleton, Allscott,
Barnsley, Bentley, Bromley, Bradney, Burcote, Chesterton,
Cranmere, Catstree, Ewdness, Fenngate, Hilton, Hoccom, Hallon,
Hartleberry, Kingslow, Little Gane, Oldington, Newton, Roughton,
Ringleford, Rowley, Stanmore, Stableford, Swancote, Worfield,
Wheel Green, Winscote, and Wyken, which places are divided into
four districts or collections, called north-east quarter,
south-east quarter, north-west quarter, and south-west
quarter.</p>
<p>The small and sequestered village of Worfield is pleasantly
situated at the foot of an immense rock of red sand stone, except
on the northern verge where the houses stand on the side of a
precipitous acclivity, and is three and a half miles N.E. from
Bridgnorth, eight miles S. from Shiffnal, and eleven miles S.W.
by S. from Wolverhampton.&nbsp; From the summit of the rock,
which is crowned with timber, a most delightful panoramic view of
the surrounding country is seen, the romantic situation of the
village, and the circuitous windings of the Worf adding much to
the picturesque beauty of the scenery.&nbsp; The river Worf is
noted for its fine trout.&nbsp; The land between this place and
Claverley stretching as far as Bridgnorth was the celebrated
Morffe Forest, where the inhabitants of Worfield had common
pasture; the king, however, appointed stewards and rangers to
take care of the woods and deer.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry
VIII. the Earl of Shrewsbury was steward or ranger for life with
a fee of 4d. per day.&nbsp; The forest has long been enclosed,
and is now covered with luxuriance and fertility.&nbsp; On the
south east side of the Morffe in early times was an important
military station, which may still be traced; the ground is
elevated, and the moat still visible, circumscribing a large
area.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to
St. Peter, is an ancient structure of red sand stone, which has
been enlarged and beautified from time to time.&nbsp; The tower
is ornamented with pinnacles, and surmounted with a lofty spire;
it is beautified with a clock, and contains a peal of six musical
bells.&nbsp; The interior has a chaste and beautiful appearance,
the side aisles are separated from the nave by pointed arches
rising from octagonal pillars, the pews are of oak, and upon the
gallery at the west end is a fine toned organ.&nbsp; The pulpit
and reading desk are elaborately carved.&nbsp; Several of the
windows are richly adorned with stained glass, and the altar is
of dark oak, exquisitely carved.&nbsp; The chancel is spacious,
and contains memorials to deceased <a name="page492"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 492</span>members of some of the principal
families in this locality.&nbsp; A side chapel, separated by a
richly carved oak screen, contains an altar tomb, with two
figures in a recumbent posture, in memory of Sir George Bromley
and his lady, dated 1688.&nbsp; Under a canopy of beautiful
workmanship are two figures in a recumbent position, which
remembers Sir Edward Bromley, Knight, chancellor of England, and
his wife, dated 1626.&nbsp; There are also many elegant mural
monuments of beautiful design and admirable workmanship, in
memory of the Davenports, Broughtons, Vickers, Marindins,
Fletchers, Masons, Johnsons, and others.&nbsp; In the church-yard
are several family vaults cut in the solid rock.&nbsp; Archdeacon
Vickers was entombed in one of these vaults with much solemnity
in May, 1851.&nbsp; The southern entrance to the church is by an
ancient porch, and through a door of remarkable and curious
workmanship.&nbsp; Over the centre of this door are located a
swarm of bees, which tradition states have been there for
ages.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;16. 15s., in the patronage of William S.
Davenport, Esq., and incumbency of the Rev. Cornelius Francis
Broadbent, M.A.&nbsp; The Rev. Henry Cunliffe, M.A., is the
officiating minister.&nbsp; The vicarial tithes have been
commuted for &pound;288. 10s.&nbsp; Mr. Davenport, the
impropriator of the rectoral tithes, receives &pound;1,745.&nbsp;
The vicarage is an ancient erection a short distance from the
church.&nbsp; &ldquo;The annals of the church of Worcester assert
that King Edward I. gave the church of Worfield to their prior
and convent for the sustenance of three monks, and for
maintaining two wax candles to be kept continually burning at the
feast of St. Wulstan, and for eight days after, and to be daily
lighted at the saying of high mass both at matins and
vespers.&nbsp; This was done in accomplishment of a vow made to
St. Wulstan.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is an endowed <span
class="smcap">Grammar School</span>, which will be found noticed
with the charities, and a <span class="smcap">National
School</span> for boys and girls&mdash;a spacious structure of
modern erection, with residences for the teachers; about sixty
boys and fifty girls attend.&nbsp; It is partly supported by
endowment and partly by subscriptions.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Davenport House</span> is a handsome and spacious
mansion of brick, with stone finishings, the seat of William
Sharington Davenport, Esq., J.P.&nbsp; The situation is
delightful, and the extensive park grounds are richly studded
with fine timber, the drives and pleasure grounds are kept in the
most beautiful order, and several of the eminences in the park
are ornamented with sculptured figures.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;King James I., by
his letters patent, dated 1st of May, in the 10th of his reign,
in consideration of &pound;5. 4s. paid by Thomas Beech and Thomas
Bradburne, granted to William Lloyd and Thomas Parker, and their
heirs, certain premises in Worfield, Bridgnorth, and Quatford, in
trust, that the yearly proceeds thereof should be employed by the
parishioners towards the maintenance of a school for the
instruction of youth in reading and writing English, and in the
accidence and principles of grammar and the Latin tongue.&nbsp;
This is usually called Lloyd and Parker&rsquo;s charity, after
the names of the original grantees of the crown, but they appear
to have been in fact only the channel through which these
premises were conveyed to the real purchasers, who were Beech and
Bradburne.&nbsp; Besides the rent an annual sum of &pound;9 was
received from Mr. Smythe when the charity commissioners published
their report, as interest at 4&frac12; per cent. on a joint bond
from his father and himself for &pound;200, dated December 13th,
1796, being an accumulation of funds which he held in his hands
as receiver of the rents of this charity.&nbsp; The total income
was &pound;46. 1s., which was applied in a distribution of money
to the poor, in the reparation of the trust premises and
schoolhouse, and in paying a small salary to a
schoolmaster.&nbsp; <i>Thomas Smith</i> left a rent charge of
16s. a year, for the instruction of two poor boys to read
English.&nbsp; <i>William Lewis</i>, who died about fifty years
ago, left &pound;60, the interest to be applied for educating
three boys in Worfield school.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Woolley</i>, in 1609, gave &pound;100 for purchasing
lands for the use of the poor of Worfield, which was laid out in
lands at Brierley.&nbsp; Other premises in Brierley were
afterwards purchased by the parish for the sum of &pound;202.
4s., made up of six different benefactions.&nbsp; Soon after the
last purchase, these properties were combined into one
estate.&nbsp; The <a name="page493"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
493</span>premises consist of 17<span class="smcap">a</span>.
2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 5<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
and produce a yearly rental of &pound;40.&nbsp; In the course of
certain proceedings in chancery respecting this charity in the
year 1808, it appears to have been stated in a valuation on oath
before the master, that the mines lying under these lands were
worth &pound;300 per acre.&nbsp; Of the income, &pound;1. 16s. is
paid to the vicar, for preaching sermons according to the
intentions of the donors; &pound;6 to the treasurer of Lloyd and
Parker&rsquo;s charity; and the rest is distributed to the poor,
according to a list made out by the trustees.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Beech</i>, in 1645, surrendered to the use of his
nephew, William Beech, certain lands in Hilton and Halton, in
trust.&nbsp; After the death of Dorothy, wife of the said Thomas
Beech, to pay 12s. 4d. at the feast of St. Michael, for
engrossing the court rolls, and placing them in the church chest
at Worfield; and after the expiration of ninety-nine years,
beginning at the death of the said Dorothy, to pay yearly at the
feast of the Ascension, to the vicar of Worfield 3s., and to the
poor of Worfield 10s.&nbsp; The charity commissioners state the
land to be vested in Mr. Smythe and Mr. Hardwick, but there was
no evidence to show that these annuities have ever been paid; and
it would appear that forty-two years&rsquo; arrears were then due
to the vicar and the poor, as the payment ought to have commenced
in the year 1777.</p>
<p><i>William Perry</i> charged a loft and half yard of land and
a cottage in Wykem with the payment of 6s. 8d. yearly, on four
specified days, to buy bread for twenty poor people of the parish
of Worfield.&nbsp; The premises afterwards became possessed by
Thomas Smith and John Bache, the former agreeing to pay 2s. 3d.
of the said rent-charge, and the other 4s. 5d.</p>
<p><i>Dr. William Congreve</i>, of Broadney, by his will dated
20th October, 1775, reciting that &pound;10 had been left in his
hands by his father and grandfather, the interest to be paid
every Good Friday to persons who had lived servants at Bradney,
and that Robert Littleford, his late servant, had left in his
hands &pound;10, the interest to be given yearly, the Sunday
after Midsummer-day, to eight servants who had lived at the least
one year at Bradney.&nbsp; Dr. Congreve charged his lands with
the payment of 10s. and 8s., as the interest of these two sums,
which is distributed according to the donor&rsquo;s
intentions.</p>
<p><i>Robert Crudgington</i>, in 1714, surrendered to the lord of
the manor of Worfield half a yard of land and three parts of a
nook of land, in Newton, on condition that the persons in
possession should pay out of the rents 20s. per annum, to be
distributed among poor widows or other necessitous persons
inhabiting in the parish of Worfield.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Bache</i>, of Chesterton, left &pound;5, the interest
to be paid on New-year&rsquo;s day to ten poor widows nominated
by the heirs of the family.&nbsp; <i>Mr. Thomas Bache</i> gave
&pound;10, and directed the interest to be applied in the same
manner.&nbsp; The interest of these two sums is now distributed
by the representatives of Mr. Bache.&nbsp; There is no document
respecting these benefactions, but they are considered as charged
generally on the family estate.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Devey</i>, in 1725, surrendered a croft to the use
of his heirs, subject to the payment of 10s. yearly, which he
directed to be distributed among poor widows of this
parish.&nbsp; This seems to be the gift mentioned on the
benefaction table, as a legacy of Mrs. Elizabeth Devey.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Smith</i>, in 1726, charged two pieces of land
called Uphill and Downhill, and the Fen lands with the payment of
30s. per annum, 16s. thereof to be paid to the schoolmaster of
Worfield, and 14s. to be divided among seven poor persons, to be
nominated by the possessors of the land.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Mary Dolman</i> left by will &pound;40, the interest
of &pound;20 thereof to be given among the poor of Worfield, and
the proceeds from the other &pound;20 to be applied in buying
bibles; one of her executors secured the payment of 40s. per
annum on his estate at Ackleton.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Arabella Davenport</i>, in 1763, bequeathed &pound;200
to the vicar and churchwardens, in trust, to be laid out in
lands, and the rents to be distributed among poor widows and
maidens of this parish.&nbsp; No purchase of lands has been made
with this money, but it is <a name="page494"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 494</span>placed in the hands of Mr. Smythe,
and secured on bond dated 9th September, 1809, with lawful
interest at four and a half per cent.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Sarah Mason</i>, in 1809, gave to the churchwardens of
Worfield for the time being, an annuity of &pound;5, to be
divided among poor widows residing in this parish.&nbsp; The
payment is charged upon the freehold and copyhold estates of the
donor, to be paid on the 24th of June and 25th December, by equal
portions.</p>
<p>It is stated on the table of benefactions that <i>George
Bromley</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, gave &pound;120 to charitable uses,
&pound;30 of which had been laid out in a purchase of land at
Brexley, and &pound;90 remained in the hands of the trustees,
which was laid out in 1730 in building a workhouse for the use of
the parish.</p>
<p>The following benefactions appear on the tablet in the church,
of which nothing further is now known.&nbsp; &pound;50 given by
<i>William Rowley</i> for a distribution of bread, &pound;5, the
gift of <i>John Beech</i>, and a legacy of &pound;20 bequeathed
by <i>John Bradburne</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ackleton</span> is a small well-built
village, and township in the parish of Worfield, two and a
quarter miles north-east from the parish church.&nbsp; The acres
and population of the several townships in Worfield are included
in the general returns of the parish.&nbsp; The principal
freeholders are the executors of the late Mr. Eykyn, Mr. Green,
Mrs. Clarke, Mrs. Patrick, Mr. Thomas Priest, and Mr. John
Richards.&nbsp; Ackleton House is a good residence occupied by
Mrs. Eykyn.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Allscott</span> is
pleasantly situated about a mile and a quarter north-west from

are Mr. John Hoccom, Mr. William Hoccom, and Miss Hoccom.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Bentley</span> lies about two miles to the

Shiffnal and Wolverhampton turnpike road.&nbsp; In 1809, a large
semi-circular cave was discovered at Burcot, in which were found
human bones, sculls, and the bones of several animals.&nbsp; The
ancient name of Bourncote, which in the Saxon language means the
cote or dwelling near to the river, of which this cave is within
a few paces serves to show the probability of this having been
the cote or dwelling, which may have given rise to the word
Burcot, the present name of the township.&nbsp; It is presumed
the bones found in this cave may have been those of persons who
made this cave the place of their occasional residence, and that
it was destroyed by a sudden convulsion of the rock, and downfall
of the soil above it.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Chesterton</span>

CONDOVER HUNDRED.</h2>
<p>The Condover hundred is bounded on the north by the liberties
of Shrewsbury, on the east by the South Bradford hundred and the
Wenlock franchise, on the west by the Ford hundred, and on the
south by the hundred of Munslow.&nbsp; The land presents a
considerable inequality of surface; the soil is various; in some
places there is a good deal of gravelly loam and sand, and in
other places a clayey soil prevails, lying upon the red sand
stone.&nbsp; The Lyth hill stands within the bounds of this
hundred, and the lofty heights of the Caradoc, Lawley, and
Longmynd connect it on the south and west with the hundreds of
Munslow and Purslow.&nbsp; The population of this hundred in 1801
was 5,818, and in 1841, 7,349, of whom 3,701 were males and 3,648
females.&nbsp; At the latter period there were 1445 inhabited
houses and 73 houses building.&nbsp; This hundred comprehends the
Condover and the Cound divisions.&nbsp; The Condover division
contains the following townships and places, viz: Bayston,
Betchcott, Betton and Alkmere, Castle Pulverbatch, Chatford,
Church Pulverbatch, Churton, Condover, Cothercott, Dorrington,
Frodesley, Lee Botwood, Longnor, Meole Brace, Newton and Edgbold,
Nobold, Picklescott, Pulley, Smethcott, Stapleton, Sutton,
Walkmills, Wilderley, Woolstaston, and Wrentnall.</p>
<p>The Cound division contains Acton Burnell, Berrington, Church
Preen, Cound, Cressage, Harley, Kenley, Pitchford, and Ruckley
and Langley.</p>
<h3>ACTON BURNELL</h3>
<p>is a parish and pleasant well-built village, seven miles
S.S.E. from Shrewsbury, comprising 2,650 acres of land, and in
1801 had 272 inhabitants; in 1841 there were 54 houses and a
population of 311 souls.&nbsp; Sir Edward Joseph Smythe, bart.,
is the land owner and lord of the manor, and resides at the Hall,
an elegant mansion of white free stone, approached by a beautiful
portico of the Ionic order; the pleasure grounds are tastefully
laid out, and the park commands a beautiful prospect of the
surrounding country.&nbsp; Near to the Hall are the ruins of
<span class="smcap">Acton Burnell Castle</span>, which is
memorable in history for a parliament held here in the year 1283,
by King Edward I., on which occasion the lords sat in the castle
and the commons in a barn.&nbsp; It was in this parliament that
the statute known by the name of the statute of Acton Burnell was
made for the purpose of enforcing the <i>statutuno de
mercatoribus</i>.&nbsp; It appoints the mode in which a statute
merchant is to be made, and by whom; fixes the manner of seizing
and valuing goods for the payment of debts; in what case the
debtor shall be imprisoned, and how maintained in prison; when
sureties shall be compelled to pay the debts of their principals,
and when they are to be exempted, &amp;c.&nbsp; Sir Robert
Burnell, who lived in the reign of William the Conqueror, had his
seat here, and his posterity flourished in this vicinity for a
long period.&nbsp; Philip Burnell, in the 54th Henry III., had
the grant of a market on Tuesday, and two fairs in the year, the
one on the eve, the day, and the day after the annunciation of
the blessed Virgin, and the other on the eve, the day, and the
morrow of St. Michael the Archangel.&nbsp; Robert Burnell, bishop
of Bath and Wells, is said to have repaired or built the castle
here in the reign of Edward I.&nbsp; The walls of the castle are
of immense thickness, and adorned with battlements and rows of
curiously carved windows.&nbsp; A short distance from the castle
stood the barn, where the commons are stated to have assembled
when the parliament was held here, it is now a complete ruin, and
the gables only remain.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Church</span> is a venerable fabric dedicated to St. Mary; the
living is a rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;6.
10s., now returned at &pound;350, in the patronage of Sir E. J.
Smythe and incumbency of the Rev. Edward Arthur Wainwright.&nbsp;
Adjoining the hall is a very beautiful <span
class="smcap">Catholic Chapel</span>, which has recently been
considerably enlarged and improved at the cost of Sir E. J.
Smythe.&nbsp; The family at the hall and a great portion of the
tenantry usually attend divine worship here.</p>
<p><a name="page499"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 499</span><span
class="smcap">Acton Pigott</span> is a hamlet with one farm and a
few cottages, one mile north-east from Acton Burnell.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;Several sums of
money left to the poor by different donors amounting in the whole
to &pound;20, were applied in repairing the workhouse, and the
inhabitants agreed to pay 20s. yearly out of the rent of the said
house, as the interest thereof, to be distributed in bread.&nbsp;
<i>Edward Bayley</i>, in 1789, left a rent charge of 10s. yearly
for a distribution of bread.&nbsp; <i>Thomas Smyth</i>, in 1673,
left 5s. per annum for a distribution of bread, to be paid
&ldquo;out of his estate to the world&rsquo;s end, if his estate
should so long continue sufficient to make it good.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It does not appear that anything has been paid in respect of this
charity for a long period.</p>

Smythe, bart., the Hall; John William Benbow, farmer; Edward
Everall, shopkeeper; Eli Charles Moore, bailiff to Sir E. J.
Smythe; Thomas Morris, farmer; Peter Perry, farmer and maltster,
Acton Pigott; Thomas Reynolds, butcher; William Southall, vict.,

<h3>RUCKLEY <span class="GutSmall">AND</span> LANGLEY</h3>
<p>is a small village and chapelry in the parish of Acton
Burnell, about one mile east from that place, and five and a half
miles west from Much Wenlock.&nbsp; At the census in 1801 there
were eighty-two inhabitants; in 1841, fifteen houses and a
population of eighty-three souls.&nbsp; The chapelry contains 952
acres of land, which is the property of Sir Edward Joseph Smythe,
bart., who is also lord of the manor.&nbsp; The chapel is an
inconsiderable structure where divine service is performed only
twice during the year.&nbsp; The living is a curacy subordinate
to the rectory of Acton Burnell.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Langley Hall</span>, an ancient mansion of
considerable extent, is now occupied as a farm house, and
although much dilapidated it has an imposing aspect, and shows
many traces of its former grandeur.&nbsp; King Charles during his
troubles was for a short period concealed here; a fine old oak
table, elaborately carved, is said to have been in the hall since
the time of King Charles, and was used by that monarch as a
dining table.</p>
<p>The <i>Farmers</i> are George Carter, Langley; Ellen Evans,
Causway wood; Richard Farr, Mere Oak; John Grainger, Langley
Hall; James Hartwright, Ruckley; Richard Stedman, Park gate; and
Edward Sumner, Ruckley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Betton and Alkmere</span> is a small
township in the parish of St. Chad, in the Condover
hundred.&nbsp; The parish of St. Chad is partly returned in the
Albrighton division and partly in the Ford division of the Ford
Hundred, but is chiefly situated within the limits of the borough
of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The village of <span class="smcap">Little
Betton</span>, or <span class="smcap">Betton Strange</span>, is
pleasantly situated two and a half miles south from Shrewsbury,
and was returned at the census of 1841 as having ten houses and
forty-eight inhabitants.&nbsp; The land owners are Lord Berwick,
and George Jonathan Scott, Esq., the latter gentleman resides at
a good house embosomed in foliage usually called Betton
Strange.</p>
<p>The principal residents are Joseph Cross, farmer; Thomas
Elsmere, farmer; and John Scott, Esq., Betton Strange.</p>
<h3>BERRINGTON</h3>
<p>is a small rural village pleasantly situated four and a half
miles S.E. by S. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The parish contains the
several townships of Berrington, Brompton, Betton, Cantlop, and
Eaton Mascot, which together in 1801 had a population of 603
souls; 1831, 684, and in 1841 there were 97 houses and 651
inhabitants.&nbsp; There was no separate return of the respective
townships at the census of 1841.&nbsp; The township of Berrington
contains 880 acres of land, with a fertile soil highly
productive.&nbsp; Lord Berwick and Sir Edward Smythe, Bart., are
the principal landowners, the latter is lord of the manor.&nbsp;
The church is an ancient structure, dedicated to All Saints; the
living is a rectory <a name="page500"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 500</span>valued in the king&rsquo;s book at
&pound;10. 12s. 1d., now returned at &pound;400 in the patronage
of Lord Berwick, and incumbency of the Hon. and Rev. T. H. N.
Hill.&nbsp; There is a national school in the village, where 45
children are educated.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Betton</span> is
a small township with 564 acres, which is the property of Lord
Berwick.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;759.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Brompton</span> township has 864 acres, which is
also the property of Lord Berwick.&nbsp; Within the bounds of
this township at Cross Houses is situated the <span
class="smcap">Atcham Union House</span>, a spacious brick pile,
calculated to accommodate 350 inmates.&nbsp; It consists of a
centre and wings; the receiving wards and infirmary are now in
course of erection at the back part of the premises, the
estimated cost of which is &pound;1,510; the old infirmary was
taken down in consequence of its being too small for the
accommodation of the patients.&nbsp; The average number of
inmates in the union house is usually about 200.&nbsp; The
average annual expenditure on the poor of the district for three
years preceding the formation of the union was
&pound;9,768.&nbsp; Total expenditure of the union for the year
ending March, 1850, &pound;4,101. 5s., being 4s. 4&frac34;d. per
head on the population comprised within the union.&nbsp; Total
number of admissions during the year, 586.&nbsp; Total number

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>John Churm</i>,
in 1629, gave &pound;13, which was laid out in the purchase of a

to buy Bibles for poor children.&nbsp; This money is also in the
Savings&rsquo; Bank.&nbsp; The interest on this and the preceding
legacy amounts to 21s. yearly, and in respect of Thompson&rsquo;s
charity a Bible or prayer book is purchased for the use of the
Sunday school, or given to some poor person of the parish, and
the remainder is distributed among the poor.</p>

<h3>CONDOVER</h3>
<p>is a considerable parish, embracing 7,422<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 21<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, of which 6,632 are titheable,
and the remainder tithe free.&nbsp; In 1801 there was a
population of 1,451 souls; 1831, 1,455; and at the census in 1851
there were 1,550 inhabitants.&nbsp; The parish embraces the
townships and hamlets of Condover, Dorrington, Bayston, Chatford,
Boreton, Lyth, Ryton, Westley, and Wheatall.&nbsp; The rectoral
tithes have been commuted for &pound;1,303. 5s.&nbsp; E. W. S.
Owen, Esq., is the impropriator.&nbsp; The vicarial tithes are
commuted for &pound;211. 5s.&nbsp; The village of Condover is
pleasantly situated in a fertile vale, five miles south from
Shrewsbury, on the road leading towards Church Stretton and
Ludlow.&nbsp; It is a place of considerable antiquity, and
retains the same name as entered in the Doomsday book.&nbsp;
William the Conqueror gave Condover to Roger de Montgomery, who
gave the church thereof to the abbey of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Upon
the attainder of the last Earl of Shrewsbury of that family, it
was seized by King Henry I., and continued in the hands of the
crown until the 11th of Henry III., when that king granted it to
his sister, the Princess of Wales.&nbsp; It was subsequently
granted to the Hastings, in whose family it continued till the
time of Edward I., when Robert Burnell, bishop of Bath and Wells,
became possessed of it by purchase.&nbsp; From the Burnells it
passed to the Lovells, and Lord Viscount Lovell forfeited it to
the crown.&nbsp; King Henry VIII. granted it to Richard Cornwell
for the term of his life, and afterwards to Henry Knyvett and his
heirs male.&nbsp; George and John Isam, who had the fee of this
manor, sold it to Thomas Owen, Esq., whose representative, Edward
William Smythe Owen, Esq., a considerable landowner in this
neighbourhood, is now the proprietor, and resides at <span
class="smcap">The Hall</span>, an elegant mansion in the
Elizabethan style of architecture, built in the year 1598.&nbsp;
It is surrounded by a park of considerable extent, beautifully
diversified with picturesque scenery.&nbsp; The Owen family
suffered much for their adherence to the royal cause during the
civil wars.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, which was appropriated
to the abbey of Shrewsbury, is dedicated to St. Andrew.&nbsp; The
living is a discharged vicarage, to which belong all vicarial
tithes and a rent charge of &pound;69, payable out of the Moot
Hall estate.&nbsp; It is valued in the king&rsquo;s book at
&pound;4. 14s.&nbsp; Edward W. S. Owen, Esq., is the patron;
incumbent, Rev. J. W. Harden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bayston Hill</span> is a pleasantly
situated village on the road from Shrewsbury to Ludlow, partly in
the parish of Condover and partly in St. Julien&rsquo;s
parish.&nbsp; A small District Church was built here about eight
years ago, the necessary funds for which were raised by voluntary
subscriptions.&nbsp; The structure consists of nave and chancel,
and a square tower.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy,
enjoyed by the Rev. John Breese.&nbsp; Bayston township, at the
census of 1841, is returned as having 148 houses and 1,193
inhabitants; Chatford township, five houses and 29 inhabitants;
and Dorrington, 66 houses and 328 inhabitants.&nbsp; The above
townships comprise the whole parish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Thomas
Owen</i>, justice of the Common Pleas, in 1598 charged certain
lands, at Great Ryton, with the payment of 53s. yearly, and
directed a distribution of bread to be made every Sunday after
divine service.&nbsp; <i>Henry Brickdale</i>, in 1700, bequeathed
&pound;44, to be laid out in land, and the proceeds expended in
bread, and distributed to six poor housekeepers every
Sunday.&nbsp; This bequest, and certain gifts in the hands of <a
name="page502"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 502</span>the parish
officers of Condover and Pulverbatch, amounting in the whole to
&pound;65. 17s. 6d. was laid out in 1709, in the purchase of a
rent charge of &pound;2. 11s. 8d., of which &pound;1. 5s. 10d. is
applied in a distribution of bread in Condover; 6s. 8d. is
carried to the church rate, and the remaining part of the rent
charge, 20s., is given in bread among the poor in
Pulverbatch.&nbsp; <i>William Haynes</i> gave &pound;1. 6s. per
annum, which is charged on lands in Berrington.&nbsp; It is
stated, in the Parliamentary returns of 1786, that <i>Mr.
Owen</i> left land for bread to the poor, then vested in the Rev.
Mr. White, and producing &pound;2. 12s. per annum.&nbsp; Mr.
White was the vicar of this parish, and he and his successors
have always paid this sum, which, with the above, is added to the
bread charity.&nbsp; <i>Henry Haynes</i>, in 1659, left a rent
charge of 26s. per annum, issuing out of land at Netley, for the
benefit of the poor.&nbsp; The owner of this property, Mr. Hope,
in the year 1800, sold it to Mr. Edwards; but the charge was
accidentally omitted to be mentioned in the conveyance, and Mr.
Hope continues to pay the rent charge.&nbsp; <i>Richard
Plumer</i> in 1811, bequeathed &pound;50, in trust, the interest
to be distributed on Christmas day yearly.&nbsp; This money is
placed in the Salop bank, and the proceeds expended in bread for
the poor.&nbsp; <i>Benjamin Price</i>, in 1797, gave the poor of
the parish of Condover &pound;50, to be given in bread; one-half
exclusively to such poor as should reside in Dorrington, without
regard to what parish they should belong.&nbsp; He also gave to
the churchwardens and overseers of Condover, &pound;500 stock
three per cent. consols, in trust, to receive the interest, and
purchase bread therewith for the most distressed poor, one-third
of which interest, or &pound;5 per annum, he directed should be
yearly laid out exclusively for poor persons residing in
Dorrington; and the remaining two-thirds in like manner for the
poor residing in the remaining part of the parish.&nbsp; The sum
of &pound;50 above mentioned, was given away soon after the
testator&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The dividends of the &pound;500
stock ore applied in the purchase of bread, and given away on two
different days in the year.&nbsp; <i>Joseph Pryce</i>, in 1824,
directed his executors to invest &pound;200, free of legacy duty,
in public stock, and to apply the dividends thereof, as the same
should from time to time be received, in providing a competent
person to superintend the education of poor children residing at
Dorrington.&nbsp; This sum of &pound;200 was laid out together
with the like sum belonging to the chapelry, in purchasing
&pound;453. 16s. 3d. stock, in the three per cent. consols,
immediately after the testator&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The share of
the dividends applicable to this charity, amounting to &pound;6.
16s. 1d. annually, is paid to a person who keeps a school at
Dorrington, who in respect thereof, teaches six or eight children
without any charge.&nbsp; It is stated on the table of
benefactions that Edward Owen left 12d. weekly to the poor.&nbsp;
The churchwardens used to receive this charity at Condover Hall,
but it does not appear that anything has been paid in respect of
this charity since the year 1804.&nbsp; <i>Benjamin Hodges</i>
gave &pound;10 for the benefit of the poor, this sum was in the
hands of the churchwardens, who paid 8s. yearly previous to the
year 1805, since which nothing has been paid in respect of this
charity.&nbsp; <i>John Reynolds</i> left &pound;50, the interest
to be given by the churchwardens among the poor.&nbsp; In 1786
this sum was vested in the overseers, who paid &pound;2 per annum
as the interest.&nbsp; The same interest was paid by the
overseers to the churchwardens up to the year 1829.&nbsp; In that
year the church was broken open and the communion plate stolen;
and it was agreed, at a vestry, that the sum of &pound;50 owing
by the overseers to the churchwardens should be called in and
laid out in the purchase of plate, which was accordingly
done.&nbsp; The parishioners contend that this was money lent by
the churchwardens to the overseers, out of the rents of the
church lands, but as there is no entry in the churchwardens
accounts to justify such a notion, it appears to us more likely
to have been the produce of Reynolds&rsquo; charity, which was in
the hands of the overseers in 1786, and which is not otherwise
accounted for.</p>
<p>There are two parcels of land in the parish of Condover, which
forms what is called the Church Estate, one parcel containing
6<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>.
23<span class="smcap">p</span>. is situate in the township of
Dorrington, and the other containing 8<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 29<span
class="smcap">p</span>. is situate at Mount Sion, in the same
parish.&nbsp; These lands were originally given for the
reparations of the church, and other <a name="page503"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 503</span>things thereto appertaining.&nbsp;
The land at Dorrington is let for &pound;22 per annum, and the
land at Mount Sion at the yearly rent of &pound;9.&nbsp; The
amount is applied by the churchwardens to the general purpose of
a church rate.</p>

<h3>DORRINGTON</h3>
<p>is a township and improving village in the parish of Condover,
six and a half miles N. from Church Stretton, and seven miles S.
from Shrewsbury, having in 1841 66 houses and 328
inhabitants.&nbsp; It is expected a railway station will be
formed at Dorrington, on the Shrewsbury and Hereford line of
railway, now in course of formation, which will no doubt add
greatly to the importance of the place.&nbsp; A new District
Church has been erected at Dorrington; it exhibits the early
English style of architecture, and contains about 300 sittings,
the greater part of which are free.&nbsp; Its simple and
unassuming exterior harmonises well with the retired and pastoral
character of the surrounding country, and forms a very
picturesque object from every point of view.&nbsp; It is built of
free stone, and consists of nave, chancel, and transepts, <a
name="page504"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 504</span>with a
tower surmounted with pinnacles.&nbsp; The interior decorations
are neat and appropriate, and it has a groined roof; a vestry has
since been added.&nbsp; The church was built by John Thomas Hope,
Esq., at an expense of &pound;3,000, and endowed with the sum of
&pound;3,800 by the same individual.&nbsp; An elegant and
spacious parsonage house, commanding a beautiful and extensive
view of the Lawley, Caradoc, and Longmynd hills, has since been
erected by the munificence of the same respected gentleman, at a
cost of &pound;1,800.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy
enjoyed by the Rev. George Masters, M.A.&nbsp; The district
embraces 545 acres.&nbsp; Convenient schools have also been
erected in the village.&nbsp; Edward W. Smythe Owen, Esq., is
lord of the manor.&nbsp; John Thomas Hope, Esq., and Mr. George
Heyward, are the principal landowners.&nbsp; The Independents
have a small chapel in the village; the congregation is under the
pastoral care of the Rev. J. Beynon.</p>

<h3>COUND</h3>
<p>is a parish and small village delightfully situated six miles
S.S.E. from Shrewsbury, and six miles N.W. from Much
Wenlock.&nbsp; The township contains 1,406 acres of land, and in
1841 had 107 houses and 511 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;2,006.&nbsp; Mrs. Thursby is the principal landowner and
lady of the manor.&nbsp; The church is an ancient structure,
consisting of nave, chancel, and side aisles, with a tower, in
which is a peal of bells.&nbsp; It contains several monuments,
one of which remembers Edward Cressett, D.D., bishop of Llandaff,
who died February 13th, 1755.&nbsp; The pulpit exhibits an
elaborate specimen of oak carving.&nbsp; The living is a rectory
with the chapelry of Cressage annexed, valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;33, now returned at &pound;906.&nbsp; The
patronage is vested in Mrs. Thursby; incumbent, Rev. Henry
Thursby, M.A.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harnage</span> is a scattered village
containing some respectable residences, one and a half miles S.E.
from Cound: the township contains 1,642 acres of land, the
principal owner of which is John Thomas Smytheman Edwards, Esq.;
the population returns are included in Cound.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;1,854. 6s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Golding</span> is an estate of 385 acres,
the property of the Earl of Liverpool.&nbsp; It is rated as a
separate township in the parish books at &pound;441.&nbsp; There
was however no distinct return of it as a separate township at
the census of 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Thomas
Langley</i>, in 1694, left a rent charge of &pound;2. 10s. per
annum for a distribution of bread every Sunday in the year except
two, &ldquo;for which two Sundays better provision was
made.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Thomas Bishop</i>, in 1768, bequeathed to
the minister and churchwardens of Cound &pound;20, the interest
to be given in penny loaves to the churchwardens on Sunday
mornings.&nbsp; A further sum of &pound;60, supposed to have been
left by a person of the <a name="page505"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 505</span>name of <i>Sicke</i>, for the
benefit of the poor of the parish, with the above &pound;20, was
laid out in the purchase of &pound;102. 4s. 9d. stock, three per
cent consols.&nbsp; <i>Mr. Dodd</i>, in 1774, left &pound;20, the
interest to be distributed in bread to the poor.&nbsp; There is a

left by <i>Richard Dutton</i>, to poor housekeepers, and
&pound;10. 2s. 6d. added by John Dodson Esq.; of the dividends
30s. are distributed in Cressage and an equal amount among the
poor of Cound.&nbsp; <i>Richard Cheese</i>, in 1808, bequeathed
&pound;50 in trust, and directed the interest to be distributed
in bread to the poor on Christmas day.&nbsp; This bequest was
subsequently invested in the purchase of &pound;65. 18s., three

<h3>CRESSAGE</h3>
<p>is a chapelry in the parish of Cound, four miles N.W. from
Much Wenlock, and eight miles S.E. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The
village is delightfully situated near the Severn, in a fertile
district, beautifully diversified with picturesque scenery.&nbsp;
The township contains 1,900 acres of land, the gross estimated
rental of which is &pound;2,393. 12s. 3d.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;1,995. 19s. 4d.&nbsp; At the census in 1841 here were 63
houses and 297 inhabitants.&nbsp; The principal landowners are
the Duke of Cleveland, Sir George Harnage, Bart., and William
Morris, Esq.&nbsp; Cressage is supposed to have derived its name
from a venerable oak of gigantic proportions which stands near
the village.&nbsp; Some time ago a fire was kindled in the hollow
of the tree, by which it was greatly injured and nearly
destroyed; it is supported by iron cramps, and there is now
flourishing in the midst of the tree a young oak, raised from an
acorn of the old tree.&nbsp; It was formerly called
Christ&rsquo;s Ache, Ache being the Saxon word for oak, and
eventually became corrupted to Cressage.&nbsp; The shade of
spreading trees we often find were chosen by the early
missionaries as preaching places for the propagation of the
Christian faith.&nbsp; Hence we have Bishop&rsquo;s Oak,
Postle&rsquo;s Oak, and at Cressage, Christ&rsquo;s Oak.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Chapel of Ease</span> is a small
unadorned structure, subordinate to the church of Cound.&nbsp; It
was built in 1841 at a cost of &pound;1,400, and contains 260
sittings.&nbsp; The funds were raised by voluntary subscriptions
and grants from the government and diocesan church building
societies.&nbsp; The original structure was situated in a meadow
a short distance from the village, and from its dampness and
dilapidated condition was totally unfit for divine worship.&nbsp;
The Rev. George Burd is the curate.</p>
<p>This village is celebrated as the birth place of Thomas Lodge,
who settled in London as a grocer, accumulated great wealth, and
rose to the civic honour of Lord Mayor of London in the year
1562.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Balswardyne Hall</span> is a
handsome mansion, the seat and property of Sir George Harnage,
Bart.; the estate comprises 750 acres, and is partly in this
chapelry, and also extends into the liberties of Wenlock,
Leighton, and Harley.&nbsp; It was purchased by the ancestor of
the present proprietor in the year 1541.&nbsp; By indenture
bearing date January 13th, 1672, it was agreed on the part of the
churchwardens and overseers of the parish of Cound, that 20s.
yearly should be paid to the churchwardens and overseers of
Cressage, as their proportion of the yearly produce of a legacy
therein stated to have been left for the benefit of the poor, by
the will of Dame Ann Eldred in the <a name="page506"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 506</span>year 1671.&nbsp; Nothing appears to
be known of this charity either in the parish of Cound, or in the
chapelry of Cressage.</p>

<h3>CHURCH PREEN,</h3>
<p>sometimes called Preen Church, is a parish and small rural
village five miles W. by S. from Much Wenlock.&nbsp; The parish
contains 1,026 acres of land, the principal owners of which are
F. T. Webster, Esq., and the Rev. Samuel Minton.&nbsp; In the
year 1801 here were 84 inhabitants; 1831, 75, and in 1841, 17
houses and 101 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;1,026.
18s. 6d.&nbsp; Here was formerly a small cell of cluniac monks,
subordinate to the priory of Wenlock.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the 29th of
Edward I., the cell of Preene was holden of the lords of Holgod,
and that on a vacancy the lords of that castle had the custody of
the same, and the prior of Wenlock in such a vacancy presented
the custodes to the lords of Holgod, who being so presented
received the temporalities.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Church</span> is remarkable for its length, and the chancel,
which belongs to the lay impropriators, occupies more than half
the space.&nbsp; It is situated close to the hall, and indeed the
walls are so incorporated as to form a part of the mansion.&nbsp;
The living is a perpetual curacy in the patronage of F. T.
Webster, Esq., and enjoyed by the Rev. Robert Armitage.&nbsp; No
tithe or rent charge is paid to the perpetual curate, but a small
modus is due from the landowners, and the living is also endowed
with &pound;800 royal bounty, and &pound;200 parliamentary
grant.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Manor House</span> or <span
class="smcap">Hall</span>, an ancient mansion, originally formed
part of the cell above noticed, is now the residence and property
of Frederick T. Webster, Esq.&nbsp; The main portion of the land
in this parish lies upon a sunny slope, the high grounds of which
command some extensive and beautiful prospects.&nbsp; It is
generally thought that coal abounds beneath the soil in this
parish.</p>

<h3>CHURCH PULVERBATCH,</h3>
<p>usually called <span class="smcap">Churton</span>, is a parish
and small rural village 7&frac12; miles S.S.W. from Shrewsbury,
and about half a mile from the turnpike road leading from
Bishop&rsquo;s Castle to the former town.&nbsp; The village is
delightfully situated, and commands a most extensive and
beautiful prospect over thousand of acres of land, with a fine
undulating surface teeming with fruitfulness; the majestic
Wrekin, Caradoc, and the Lawley are seen in the distance, and
give an additional charm to the scene.&nbsp; The parish contains
the townships of Church Pulverbatch or Churton, Castle
Pulverbatch, Cothercott, Wilderley, and Wrentnall.&nbsp; In 1801
here were 439 inhabitants; 1831, 557, and in 1841, 543.&nbsp;
Acres, 3,583.&nbsp; Pulverbatch was formerly a place of some
consequence, and had a weekly market.&nbsp; We find Philip Marmyn
in the 38th of Henry III. obtained a charter for a market to be
held on a Monday, and a fair on the eve, the day, and the morrow
of St. Edith.&nbsp; An annual fair is still held on September
27th, but the market has long been obsolete.&nbsp; A short
distance south from the village formerly stood a castle, the site
of which may still be traced.&nbsp; In the 6th of King John,
William de Cantilupe was <a name="page507"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 507</span>governor of this castle.&nbsp; It
was afterwards the seat of the Botelers, and was a place of great
strength.&nbsp; The escheat roll of the 6th of Henry VI., makes
mention of a free chapel belonging to the castle, in the
patronage of Edward le Botiler.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Church</span> is an ancient structure dedicated to St.
Edith.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;10. 13s. 4d., now returned at &pound;566 in the
patronage of Lord Kenyon; incumbent, Rev. George C. Guise.&nbsp;
The township of Churton or Church Pulverbatch at the census in
1841 contained twenty houses and ninety inhabitants.&nbsp; The
Hon. H. W. Powis is the principal landowner and lord of the
manor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;The poor of this
parish have 20s. yearly from Henry Brickdale&rsquo;s charity,
noticed with Condover.&nbsp; It appears the poor of this parish
are entitled to receive 6s. more in respect of this charity, the
division at present made between this parish and Condover not
being according to the directions of the donor.&nbsp; <i>Ann
Jaundrell</i>, in 1777, left by will &pound;20, the interest to
be expended in bread for the poor.&nbsp; This gift was
subsequently laid out in pewing the church, and a yearly sum of
20s. is paid by the parish as the interest thereof.&nbsp; The
bread is distributed on St. Thomas&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; <i>James
Perkins</i>, by his will, bearing date 11th July, 1790, charged
his tenement and farm at Marton, in the parish of Chirbury, with
the payment of &pound;1. 6s. per annum to the minister for the
time being of Church Pulverbatch, in trust, to lay out the same
in the purchase of bread to be distributed every Sunday to six
decayed widows, who should attend divine service at the
church.&nbsp; There is a distribution of bread every alternate
Sunday, with this gift and Brickdale&rsquo;s charity, among the
most necessitous poor.&nbsp; <i>Richard Perkins</i>, who died in
1798, left &pound;1. 6s., charged upon his estate at Church
Pulverbatch, to be distributed to the poor on New
Year&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; The 26s. is annually expended in bread
and given on the above day among the most deserving poor.</p>

<h4>COTHERCUTT</h4>
<p>is a township with a few scattered houses, delightfully
situated in a hilly district, commanding pleasing views of the
surrounding country; the air is peculiarly dry and salubrious,
and the situation is one of a retired and pastoral
character.&nbsp; Not far from here is Stiperstone Hill, which
rises an immense height, and is seen at a considerable
distance.&nbsp; Upon this hill are several great heaps of stones,
close together, called by the Britons <i>Carneddan
tewion</i>.&nbsp; It is uncertain whether these were some of
those alluded to by Giraldus Cambrensis in these words,
&ldquo;The last Harold on foot with a company of foot soldiers
lightly armed, and furnished with such provisions as the country
produced for them, went over all Wales, and made his way through
it in so brave a manner that he left very few alive.&nbsp; In
token and perpetual memory of this victory, you will find in
Wales many heaps of stones, according to the ancient custom of
the places where he gained an advantage, with these letters
inscribed on them:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Hic fuit victor Haraldus</i>;
Here Harold was victorious.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Cothercutt is
situated eleven miles S.W. from Shrewsbury, and the township
contains 560 acres of land.&nbsp; In 1841 here were six houses
and 33 inhabitants.</p>
<p><a name="page508"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 508</span>The
resident farmers are David Clayton, John Smith, and William

<h4>WILDERLEY</h4>
<p>township lies about a mile from Church Pulverbatch, and ten
miles S.W. from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It contains 671 acres of land,
the rateable value of which is &pound;659. 1s. 4d.&nbsp; In 1841
here were 11 houses and 71 inhabitants.</p>
<p>The principal residents are the following farmers, viz., James
Ambler, Richard Dovaston, Joshua Roderick, and Thomas

value, &pound;1,195. 8s.&nbsp; The Baptists have a small place of
worship in the village.&nbsp; James Freme, Esq., is the principal
landowner in this township, and resides at an elegant mansion
most delightfully situated on elevated ground, commanding views
of great diversity and beauty.</p>
<p>The principal residents are James Freme, Esq.; John Breese,
farmer; and Benjamin Burgwin, farmer.</p>
<h3>FRODESLEY</h3>
<p>is a parish and village, eight miles south-east from
Shrewsbury, containing 2,188 acres of land, and in 1841 had 39
houses and 214 inhabitants: population in 1801, 158; in 1831,
186.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;2,322. 7s. 6d.&nbsp; This
parish is bounded on the south by one of the Frodesley hills,
which form a connecting link between the Caradoc, Lawley, and the
Wrekin.&nbsp; Though it possesses little to recommend it to the
notice of the antiquarian, it is a parish of ancient date, being
mentioned in the Doomsday Survey as held by one Siward, a
freeman; the manor is subsequently inserted among the fees of
Philip Burnel.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Sir E. J.
Smythe, Bart., and Panton Corbet, Esq.&nbsp; The Roman Watling
street runs for about two miles through this parish, in a line
with the present turnpike road from Atcham to Church
Stretton.&nbsp; The Hall is an ancient structure in the
Elizabethan style, of rough stone, with dressed quoins and
mullions.&nbsp; It was formerly the residence of Colonel Scriven,
a staunch adherent to King Charles I.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Lodge</span> is of a later date, partaking
somewhat of the same style as the hall, and was formerly
surrounded by a well-wooded and picturesque park.&nbsp; About the
year 1780 it was inhabited by Godolphin Edwardes, Esq., then the
possessor of the greater part of Frodesley.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span> dedicated to St. Mark, a plain
structure, was rebuilt in 1809.&nbsp; The interior is neat, and
the chancel was recently entirely refitted and decorated with
much taste by the present incumbent.&nbsp; The living is a
rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;4. 14s., now
returned at &pound;392, in the patronage of the Rev. T. L.
Gleadowe, M.A., the present rector.&nbsp; The rectory is a
commodious house delightfully situated and surrounded with
shrubberies and pleasure grounds tastefully laid out.&nbsp; Major
Herbert Edwardes, C.B., was born at the rectory, whose father,
grandfather, and great-grandfather were severally rectors of
Frodesley.&nbsp; A few years ago a coal mine was worked for a
short period, but the bed of coal being very thin and of an
inferior quality it was closed.</p>

<h3>LONGNOR</h3>
<p>is a parish and small rural village in a well wooded and
fertile country, the prospects of which are enlivened by rich
pastoral landscape, rendered more delightful by its contrast with
the majestic Carodoc and other hills.&nbsp; The village lies on
the road from Shrewsbury to Ludlow, eight miles S. from the
former place, and five miles N.N.E. from Church Stretton.&nbsp;
The parish contains 790 acres of land, which is chiefly the
property of Panton Corbett, Esq., who is also lord of the manor,
and resides at Longnor Hall, a handsome brick mansion, built in
the year 1670, by Sir Richard Corbett; the situation commands
several fine views, and the pleasure grounds are tastefully laid
out.&nbsp; The population of Longnor in 1801 was 177; in 1831,
244, and in 1841 there were 53 houses and 243 inhabitants.&nbsp;
The church is a small structure situated in the park, with lancet
windows, exhibiting the style of architecture prevalent during
the 12th century.&nbsp; It was formerly a free chapel belonging
to the abbey of Haughmond.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy
in the patronage of Panton Corbett, Esq., and enjoyed by the Rev.
Waties Corbett, chancellor of Hereford.</p>
<p><i>Sir Richard Corbett</i>, by his will, dated 19th of
November, 1764, devised for a term of 900 years, all his lands
and tenements, on trust, among other things by sale or mortgage,
to raise &pound;100, and lay out the same on government or other
security, and dispose of the interest yearly among the
necessitous poor of Longnor.&nbsp; And upon further trust to
raise in the same manner &pound;700, and to apply of the interest
yearly on the 24th of April &pound;12 yearly among three
industrious young or decayed tradesmen, actual housekeepers and
shopkeepers, carrying on business and residing in the county of
Salop, in equal shares, such persons to be appointed by the owner
of the testator&rsquo;s capital mansion at Longnor, and the
residue to be disposed of yearly in clothing six poor boys and
six poor girls of Longnor, Cardington, Leebotwood, and
Frodesley.&nbsp; The testator also gave the further sum of
&pound;200, the interest to be disposed of in the instruction of
poor children in the township of Longnor; and also such poor
children of the tenants as should he thought proper objects in
the parishes of Leebotwood, Cardington, and Frodesley.&nbsp; All
the above legacies remain charged upon the estates of the
testator, now in the possession of Panton Corbett, Esq., who pays
the yearly interest, for the objects specified in the
testator&rsquo;s will.</p>

<h3>MEOLE BRACE</h3>
<p>is a populous and delightful village situated about a mile S.
from Shrewsbury, and indeed may be considered a suburb to that
town, as there is a continuation of pleasing villas and good
residences, occupied by gentlemen and tradesmen, who have by the
exertions of honest industry acquired a tolerable share of the
conveniences and comforts of this life, scattered on the road
from Shrewsbury to the church at Meole.&nbsp; The best situation
for viewing this pleasing village is perhaps on the bank, just on
crossing the bridge.&nbsp; In the front is the little bridge
thrown over the Rea brook, which meanders through the rich
meadows, covered with fruitfulness and studded with
plantations.&nbsp; The quiet requirement of Meole, with the
church embosomed in foliage, and a distant prospect of
Shrewsbury, with its turrets, spires, and a pleasing variety of
objects, adds much to the picturesque beauty of the scene.&nbsp;
The parish of Meole embraces the townships of Newton and Edgbold,
Nobold, part of Pulley, and also extends into the borough of
Shrewsbury, and in 1801 comprised 1,253 inhabitants; 1831, 1207,
and in 1841 there were 209 houses and 1,195 inhabitants.&nbsp;
There are 2,487<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 34<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land
in the parish.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;7,375. 15s.&nbsp; The
landowners in Meole are Mrs. Bather, Hon. Henry Wentworth Powis,
James Loxdale, Esq., George Jeffreys, Esq., and others; the
former is lady of the manor.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Church</span>, dedicated to All Saints, is a neat brick cruciform
structure, with a short tower at the west end.&nbsp; It stands on
the site of an ancient edifice taken down in the year 1799.&nbsp;
The living is a vicarage valued in the king&rsquo;s book at
&pound;5, now returned at &pound;389 in the patronage and
incumbency of the Rev. Edward Bather.&nbsp; There is a <span
class="smcap">National School</span> in the village, which was
built by the late Ven. Archdeacon Bather.&nbsp; It is supported
by voluntary subscriptions and a small charge from each scholar;
120 boys and girls are educated in the school.&nbsp; John Davies
is the teacher.&nbsp; The rectoral tithes, not purchased by the
landowners, are commuted for &pound;24. 1s. 6d., and the vicarial
for &pound;196. 19s. 1d.&nbsp; A neat almshouse has recently been
erected upon an elevated plot of land near the turnpike
road.&nbsp; It is a brick structure with stone finishings, and
was built with funds bequeathed by the late Mr. Evans, who also
bequeathed certain funds for the endowment.&nbsp; There are nine
poor widows inmates; each poor person has a convenient low room
and a bed room, with a small plot of garden ground, and an
allowance of eight pound per annum.&nbsp; There is a respectable
inn and <span class="smcap">Bowling Green</span> kept by Mrs.
Vicars, which is frequented by <a name="page512"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 512</span>the tradesmen from Shrewsbury, who
here spend a pleasant evening&rsquo;s relaxation from
business.&nbsp; There are collieries at Nobold and some other
places, but no coal has been got at Meole for the last four
years.&nbsp; The House of Industry noticed with the account of
Shrewsbury stands within the bounds of this parish.&nbsp; There
was formerly a castle at Meole, which in early times was the
residence of the Mackworths; there are no vestiges of the
structure left.</p>

513</span>PITCHFORD</h3>
<p>is a pleasant village, containing some genteel residences,
seven miles south from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The parish contains
1,617 acres of fertile land; and in 1801 here were 220
inhabitants; 1831, 197; and in 1841, 35 houses and 186
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;1,868. 9s.&nbsp; Gross
estimated rental, &pound;1,998. 5s.&nbsp; The Earl of Liverpool
is the landowner in this township.&nbsp; The name of the place
arises from a spring, upon which a scum of a bituminous nature
flows.&nbsp; Camden compares the scum of this well with the
matter that is found in the lake Asphalites, in Palestine, and
says there is a spring of the same kind in Samasota.&nbsp; This
place was formerly the seat and inheritance of a family of the
same name.&nbsp; In the 5th of Edward I. we find John de
Pycheford held the manor by the service of one knight&rsquo;s
fee.&nbsp; The last of this family of whom we read is Ralph de
Pycheford, who, in the time of Edward I., levied a fine to Walter
de Langton, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and to his heirs of
the advowson of the church and of lands in Albrighton &ldquo;et
de maner de Pycheford&rdquo;.&nbsp; In the 15th of Edward II.
that bishop was found to be seised of this manor at his
death.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a venerable
fabric, dedicated to St. Michael, and contains a curious oaken
figure in memory of a Baron de Pycheford, a crusader, in chain
armour, who was buried here.&nbsp; There are also four handsome
alabaster monuments to the ancient family of Ottley.&nbsp; The
living is a rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;6.
5s. 4d., now returned at &pound;228, in the patronage of the Earl
of Liverpool, and enjoyed by the Rev. Charles Powell
Peters.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Pitchford Hall</span>, situated
a short distance from the church, the seat of the Earl of
Liverpool, is a fine and rare specimen of the old English
mansion.&nbsp; The house is framed with timber springing into a
variety of forms for its support, the interstices being filled
with plaster and painted black and white.&nbsp; It is exceedingly
picturesque in appearance, and the grounds are beautifully
diversified and richly wooded.&nbsp; It was formerly the
residence of the Ottley family.&nbsp; William Ottley was sheriff
of this county in 1499, and again in 1513.&nbsp; The mansion,
from its style of architecture, was probably built about that
period.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;In the
parliamentary returns of 1786 it is stated that <i>Lucy
Ottley</i>, by will, in 1687, gave &pound;20, and <i>Sir Adam
Ottley</i>, by will, in 1693, &pound;50 to the poor of Pitchford,
and that there was a parish stock of &pound;20 then vested in
Thomas Ottley, Esq., in respect of which sums &pound;5 was paid
yearly.&nbsp; This payment continued up to the year 1806, when
Thomas Ottley, Esq., died, and his estates became the property of
the Hon. C. C. Jenkinson, afterwards Lord Liverpool.&nbsp; In the
year 1807 there is an entry in the parish book of &pound;5,
received from him, &ldquo;to exempt him from serving
offices,&rdquo; and that the same sum was paid annually up to the
year 1815 inclusive, and from that time the payment was no longer
made.&nbsp; In a letter written by Lord Liverpool to the rector,
dated 10th March, 1830, in answer to an application upon the
subject, his lordship states that he took no personal property
from the Ottleys, and that the payment of &pound;5 made by him
for a few years after he succeeded to the estate was to exempt
him from serving the parish offices, and that when he took the
office of overseer in 1815, the payment of course ceased.</p>

<h3>SMETHCOTT, <span class="GutSmall">OR</span> SMETHCOTE,</h3>
<p>is a parish and village pleasantly situated in a hilly
country, eight and a half miles south-west by south from
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The tops of the hills have a bleak and barren
aspect, but the lowlands are clothed with rich verdure, and
finely timbered, which gives the scenery a very beautiful and
picturesque appearance.&nbsp; A waterfall a little south from the
parsonage and the scenery in its vicinity are peculiarly
attractive, and the frequent resort of pleasure parties.&nbsp;
The parish contains the townships of Smethcott, Picklescott, and
the hamlet of Walk Mills.&nbsp; <a name="page514"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 514</span>In 1801 there was a population of
338 souls; 1831, 366; and in 1841, 371.&nbsp; The township of
Smethcott contains 1,049 acres of land, and at the census of 1841
had 27 houses and 129 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;1,218. 5s.&nbsp; At the Doomsday survey, Edmund held of
Earl Roger Smerecote in Conodoure hundred.&nbsp; In the 1st of
Edward I. it was reputed among the fees belonging to the barony
of Montgomery, then in the tenure of George de Cantilupe.&nbsp;
In the 9th of Edward II., Edward Burnele was seized of the third
of the ville of Smethcott, with the liberty of common in the
woods there, and had 48s. 3d. issuing out of lands in that
manor.&nbsp; Upon the attainder of Lord Lovell, 1st of Henry
VIII., Smethcott was given to the Duke of Bedford in tail, who,
dying without issue, 5th of Henry VIII., it was granted to the
Duke of Norfolk.&nbsp; The principal landowners now are W. W.
Whitmore, Esq., and Richard Bromley, Esq.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Michael,

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;By indentures of
lease and release, dated 30th September, 1741, <i>Henry
Powis</i>, lord of the manor of Wilderley, conveyed to the
overseers of Smethcott a cottage and land on Smethcott Common, in
trust, for the sole benefit and advantage of the poor of the said
parish.&nbsp; There are now four cottages, with a little garden
to each, and three closes, containing about an acre and a half of
ground altogether.&nbsp; Two of the cottages were occupied by
paupers, rent free, and the other two for three pounds per annum
each.&nbsp; The land is let at &pound;4. 10s. per annum, and the
whole of the rents received are carried to the poor&rsquo;s
rate.&nbsp; All these cottages and premises, about twenty years
ago, were in the occupation of persons who, having been long in
possession, refused to pay rent, or give them up.&nbsp; By the
interference of the magistrates, they were obliged to pay an
acknowledgement, and afterwards a full rent was paid.&nbsp; It
appears from the terms in which these cottages were given, that
they were intended for the benefit of the poor, and therefore any
rates received from the premises ought to be given away in
charity, and not carried to the poor&rsquo;s rate.</p>
<p>An entry in the parish book, dated 24th May, 1810, states,
that the <i>Rev. Henry Fletcher</i>, rector of Smethcott, had
that day transferred &pound;200 navy five per cents, in the name
of the rector, the Rev. William C. Curtis, curate, and Mr.
Prestland, his attorney, in trust for the poor of this parish,
for educating six poor children, and for relieving six of the
most necessitous poor widows.&nbsp; Mr. Fletcher died on the 17th
of February, 1830, and the sum of &pound;10 was paid on account
of this charity by his agent shortly after.&nbsp; Of the
&pound;10 received, &pound;6 are applied in relieving the
distressed poor, and &pound;4 in educating poor children.</p>

<h3>STAPLETON</h3>
<p>is a parish and village, five and a half miles S.S.W. from
Shrewsbury, comprising 870 acres of land, and in 1801 had 228
inhabitants; 1831, 235; and in 1841, 46 houses and 257
inhabitants.&nbsp; A short distance from Stapleton are the
remains of an ancient barrow, which on being opened some years
ago was found to contain a large funeral urn placed near the
centre, the ashes it contained were no doubt the remains of a
person of distinction in former days.&nbsp; The Hon. H. W. Powis,
and John T. Hope, Esq., are the principal landowners.&nbsp; In
the 18th of Edward I., Robert de Stapleton had a grant of free
warren in Stapleton; two years after the king&rsquo;s attorney
brought a writ of right against the said Robert de Stapleton, for
the manor of his name as being seizen of King Henry II., the
king&rsquo;s ancestor, but without effect, for the said Robert
died seized of the manor, in the 49th of Edward III.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span> is a venerable fabric dedicated
to St. Julian.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;6. 7s. 6d., now returned at
&pound;624, in the patronage of the Hon. Henry Wentworth Powis,
and incumbency of the Hon. and Rev. E. R. B. Fielding.&nbsp; An
ancient residence, now partly surrounded by a moat, exhibits a
fine specimen of the domestic architecture of by-gone days; the
walls are of great thickness, and the house contains some
beautiful specimens in antique oak carving, which are in a good
state of preservation.&nbsp; The moat, now partly filled up, is
about 200 yards in circumference, and the width 36 feet.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Netley</span> is a small hamlet in this
township.&nbsp; Netley Hall is a good house, the residence of
John Thomas Hope, Esq.; a little west from it is the site of a
British camp, some parts of which have recently been levelled for
agricultural purposes, so that now only a part of it can be
traced.&nbsp; In a field not far from here were found four
peculiarly hard stones, with a sharp axe-like edge all round;
they are known by the name of celts, and were used by the priests
to slay the victims of their sacrifices.</p>

<h3>SUTTON,</h3>
<p>a small parish and pleasant little village one and a quarter
mile S.E. by S. from Shrewsbury, is watered by the Reabrook
stream, upon the banks of which two corn mills have been
erected.&nbsp; This parish was formerly an appendage to Wenlock
priory, and extra parochial.&nbsp; At the general dissolution of
religious houses in the reign of Henry VIII., it fell to the
crown, at which time there was an hermitage here.&nbsp; The
parish contains upwards of 703 acres of land, and at the census
of 1841 there were 16 houses and 67 inhabitants.&nbsp; In 1801
there was a population of 45 souls here.&nbsp; The parish <a
name="page516"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 516</span>church is a
very humble structure of primitive simplicity, dedicated to St.
John; it stands on a gentle eminence, and commands some pleasing
views of rural scenery.&nbsp; The living is a rectory in the
diocese of Hereford and archdeaconry of Salop, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;3, now returned at &pound;17 in the
patronage of Lord Berwick and incumbency of the Rev. Henry
Hill.&nbsp; Divine service is performed once a month.&nbsp; A
short distance from the church is the celebrated <span
class="smcap">Sutton Spa</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The spring issues
from a rocky stratum of ash-coloured clay or argillaceous
schistus, containing (as appears by its effervesence with nitrous
acid) a small portion of lime.&nbsp; Fresh from the spring the
Sutton water is clear and colourless, and exhales a slightly
sulphureous smell, which is most perceptible in rainy
weather.&nbsp; It sparkles little when poured into a glass,
having no uncombined carbonic acid in its composition.&nbsp; When
first drawn its strong salt taste is evidently mixed with a
chalybeate flavour; but the latter is wholly lost on exposure for
a few hours, bubbles of air repeating slowly, and a reddish
sediment lining the sides and bottom of the vessel.&nbsp; The
Sutton water has by many been compared with that of Cheltenham,
and supposed to contain nearly the same ingredients.&nbsp; It
bears, however, a much closer resemblance to sea water, and has
accordingly been found most beneficial in those cases for which
sea water is usually recommended.&nbsp; In the case of scrophula,
the superior merits of sea water have been universally
acknowledged.&nbsp; A similarity of ingredients would naturally
lead us to expect similar effects from the Sutton water; and I am
happy to bear testimony, says Dr. Evans, that a twenty years
attendance at the Salop Infirmary, as well as in private
practice, has furnished me with abundant proofs of its success in
the treatment of scorphulous affections; and in addition to the
properties possessed by the Sutton spring in common with sea
water, it enjoys an evident advantage in containing
iron.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is to be lamented that there are not any
accommodations for the residence of invalids.&nbsp; The air is
pure and salubrious, and as a site for building purposes the
immediate vicinity is peculiarly romantic and interesting.&nbsp;
There is a cottage at the Spa, where parties sometimes take tea,
and a bath has been erected, which is open to the public on
reasonable terms.&nbsp; All parties visiting the spring are
allowed to partake of the water without any charge.&nbsp; The
land in this parish is the property of Lord Berwick.</p>

<h3>WOOLSTASTON</h3>
<p>is a village and parish five miles N. from Church Stretton,
which contains 834 acres of land.&nbsp; In 1801 there were 101
inhabitants; 1831, 89, and in 1841 17 houses and a population of
84 souls.&nbsp; In the 9th of Edward I.&nbsp; Robert Burnel,
bishop of Bath and Wells, had a grant of free warren in
Wolfestantone.&nbsp; In the 34th of the same reign we find John
de Sibeton had the privilege of free warren here, with the grant
of a free market to be held on a Wednesday, and a fair to
continue for three days.&nbsp; Upon the attainder of Lord Lovell
in the time of Henry VII. this manor was given to Jasper Duke of
Bedford, but he dying without issue, Thomas Duke of Norfolk had a
grant of it in the 5th of Henry VIII.&nbsp; W. W. Whitmore is now
chief landowner in this parish.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Church</span> is a small structure, with nave, chancel, and
tower.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;5, now returned at &pound;162 in the patronage of
W. W. Whitmore, Esq., and incumbency of the Rev. E. Carr.&nbsp;
Richard Lucas, who died about twenty years ago, was parish clerk
for 74 years; he died at the age of 95 years, and rung the church
bell almost to the day of his death.&nbsp; In the latter part of
his life he would frequently observe he had seen the end of all
his parishioners three times over, and had been the clerk to two
rectors and six curates.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Hall</span>, now occupied by Mr. Everall as a farm dwelling, was
formerly a place of consequence, and the residence of families of
consideration.&nbsp; One of the apartments exhibits some line
specimens of carved oak; the floor, ceiling, and sides are all of
highly polished oak.&nbsp; A piece of land containing <a
name="page517"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 517</span>about four
acres, supposed to have been given by a person of the name of
Pope, for keeping the church in repair, is in the possession of
the churchwardens, and is let at the yearly rent of &pound;1.
14s., which is carried to the account of the church rates.&nbsp;

<h3>THE MUNSLOW HUNDRED.</h3>
<p>The hundred of Munslow comprehends the Upper and Lower
divisions, and is bounded on the north by the hundred of
Condover, on the east by the Wenlock Franchise, the Stottesden
hundred, and a detached part of the hundred of Overs; on the west
are the hundreds of Clun and Purslow, and on the south the county
of Hereford.&nbsp; In the hundred of Munslow there is much clay,
with considerable quantities of a stony soil of a great variety
lying upon the lime stone.&nbsp; The upper surface of the rocks
is frequently broken up by the plough and becomes with the soil a
rocky loam, which produces good crops of grain.&nbsp; The
population in 1821 was 10,478, exclusive of the borough of
Ludlow; the number of houses 1,888.&nbsp; In 1841 there were
12,043 inhabitants, of whom 8,126 were in the Upper division, and
3,917 in the Lower division.&nbsp; At the same period there were
1,576 inhabited houses, 49 uninhabited in the Upper division, and
747 inhabited, and 36 uninhabited in the Lower division.&nbsp;
The Lower division comprises the following parishes, viz.: Abdon,
Ashford Bowdler, Ashford Carbonell, Bromfield, Clee, St.
Margaret, Diddlebury, Easthope, Holdgate, Hopton in the Hole,
Halford Chapelry, Ludford, Munslow, Onibury, Richards Castle,
Skirmage Extra Parochial, Staneton Lacy, Stanton Long, Stoke St.
Milborough, Stokesay, Tugford, and Weston Cold.</p>
<p>The Upper division contains the parishes of Acton Scott,
Cardington, Eaton, Hope Bowdler, Rushbury, Shipton, and Church
Stretton.</p>
<h3>ABDON</h3>
<p>is a small parish and village in the Lower division of the
Munslow hundred, ten miles south-east from Much Wenlock, which
contains 710 acres of land, the rateable value of which is
&pound;609.&nbsp; At the census in 1801 the parish had a
population of 134 souls; 1831, 170; and in 1841 there were 36
houses and 155 inhabitants.&nbsp; Sir Sidney Herbert is the
principal landowner and lord of the manor.&nbsp; <span

<h3>ACTON SCOTT, <span class="GutSmall">OR</span>
ACTON-ON-THE-HILL,</h3>
<p>a parish in the upper division of the Munslow Hundred, three
miles and a half S.S.E. from Church Stretton, is bounded on the
western side by the Shrewsbury and Ludlow turnpike road, and that
from Wenlock to Bishop&rsquo;s Castle passes through it.&nbsp; It
is divided into the townships of Acton Scott and Alcaston, and
contains 1,889 acres of hilly land, moderately <a
name="page518"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 518</span>fertile,
resting on sand-stone, in some places rich in fossil shells, and
watered by the Quenny and Marbrook streams.&nbsp; At the census
of 1801, the parish contained 164 souls; 1841, 34 houses and 204
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;1,727.&nbsp; On an
eminence, above the Shrewsbury road, called the Castle Hill, it
is supposed a fortification once existed; and in a field,
adjoining the church-yard, some remains of a tower were standing
in the memory of some of the old inhabitants, but all traces of
it are now gone.&nbsp; In the year 1817, in straightening a road,
some remains of a Roman ville were discovered, consisting of
hypocausts, tiles, &amp;c.&nbsp; Several eastern coins were also
found, which is remarkable as being the only instance in which
these coins have been found in Roman stations in England.&nbsp;
On some of the tiles were impressions of the sandals of the Roman
soldiers, made before the clay had been burned; there were also
the foot-marks of dogs and other animals.&nbsp; These remains
were found within a mile of the Roman road which runs from
Wroxeter, by Church Stretton, to Shenchester.&nbsp; The name of
Acton is derived from <i>Ac</i> (the Saxon for oak) and
<i>ton</i> (a town), and that of Scott from a family who were
very early settled here, and about the 12th century ceased to use
their original name and adopted this of their residence
only.&nbsp; At the time of the Doomsday survey the manor belonged
to Rainald, the Sheriff, and it afterwards passed to the
Fitzalans.&nbsp; In the year 1290, an inquest was held to
determine the boundaries of the royal forests in Shropshire, when
Acton Scott, Henly, and Alcaston, were declared to be without the
limits, though Shetton, Minton, and Rushbury, were found to be
within them, and subject to all the grievances of forest
laws.&nbsp; The present lord of the manor is Edward William Wynne
Pendarves, Esq., of Pendarves, in Cornwall, one of the
representatives in parliament for that county, who succeeded to
the property in 1835, on the death of his brother, who inherited
this and other estates in right of his mother, the only daughter
of Edward Acton, Esq., of Acton Scott, the last male
representative of the elder branch of the family, who died in
1775, Sir John d&rsquo;Albery Acton, Bart., being descended from
a younger branch.&nbsp; The mansion house of Acton Scott is of
the Elizabethan period, with projecting gables and bay windows,
and stands in a commanding situation near to the church.&nbsp; It
is at present occupied by Mrs. Stackhouse Acton.&nbsp; The whole
of the township of Acton Scott is the property of E. W. W.
Pendarves, Esq.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St.
Margaret, though devoid of architectural beauty, is remarkably
neat, and contains a few monuments, chiefly to the Acton family,
and a brass tablet, of the date of 1579, to the memory of
Elizabeth Mytton.&nbsp; The tower is of much older date than the
body of the church, and was probably an appendage to the church
to which the bishop of Hereford inducted Hugh de Pentone (by
lapse of time) in 1276.&nbsp; In the tower are three bells, on
two of which are inscribed in old letters:&mdash;&ldquo;Ave Maria
in gratia plena dominus tecum,&rdquo; and on the other,
&ldquo;Marie eternis et bonis resonet campana.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
living is a rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;5.
10s.; patron, the lord of the manor; incumbent, Rev. Walter
Corbett, chancellor of the diocese; curate, Rev. George
Magee.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Rectory</span> is a neat
residence, pleasantly situated, and there are 40 acres of glebe
land.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for &pound;230.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>John
Monsell</i> devised four parcels of land, containing, by
estimation, 60 acres, in the parish of Mainstone, upon trust, to
pay thereout the following sums on the 1st March,
viz.:&mdash;20s. to the parish of Morvill; 10s. to the poor of
Wistanstow; 10s. to buy Bibles for poor children of
Bishop&rsquo;s Castle; and 5s. to the poor of Acton Scott.&nbsp;
The above sums had all been regularly paid when the Charity
Commissioners published their report, except the yearly sum of
5s. to Acton Scott, which the owner of the estate agreed for the
future to pay.&nbsp; In the parliamentary returns of 1786 three
donations are mentioned as given for the benefit of poor
housekeepers of this parish.&nbsp; To the two first, amounting to
&pound;36, no names are given as the donors thereof; the third,
being &pound;20, is attributed to <i>Edward Acton</i>.&nbsp;
Interest on the sum of &pound;56 is now paid, which is laid out
in fuel by the resident curate, which he distributes to the
poor.</p>

the parish of Acton Scott, comprises 527 acres of land, and is
situated about a mile south from the parish church.&nbsp;
Rateable value, &pound;381. 14s.&nbsp; Alcaston was at an early
period taken out of the manor of Acton Scott; it consists of
three farms, belonging respectively to Thomas Dunne, Esq., G. M.
Benson, Esq., and the Rev. Mr. Hill; the latter gentleman being
of the same family as the Hills of Hawkestone.&nbsp; This branch
was settled here in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and occupied a
curious old timber mansion, a great part of which was taken down
about ten years ago.&nbsp; Mr. Benson&rsquo;s farm house also
bears marks of antiquity; it is of brick, and has been moated,
but it has lost much of its ancient character by modern
repairs.&nbsp; A portion of the long line stone ridge, known as
Wenlock Edge, stretches into this township.</p>

<h3>BROMFIELD</h3>
<p>is a parish and pleasant rural village, two miles north-west
from Ludlow, formerly distinguished for its priory which was
situated near or adjoining to the present church.&nbsp; The
parish comprises 5,592<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. of land, the principal owner of which is
the Hon. R. H. Clive; the trustees of Ludlow charities are also
proprietors.&nbsp; At the census in 1801, this parish contained
540 inhabitants; 1831, 517; and in 1841, 114 houses, and 531
souls.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;7,308. 17s. 7d.&nbsp; The few
remains of the ancient priory are situated near to the
church.&nbsp; The establishment in the time of Henry I. consisted
of a small college of prebendaries or secular canons.&nbsp;
Osbertus Prior, of Bromfield, is witness to a deed before the
year 1148.&nbsp; This priory was greatly enriched by Henry II.,
who granted to it his church in Bromfield, which was dedicated to
the blessed St. Mary, with his royal licence and protection of
their extensive possessions of the towns and lands of Haverford,
Dinchope, Efford, Felton, Burghey and Lethewick; three prebends
in Bromfield, and three in Halton.&nbsp; In the second of Henry
II. the prior and brothers of Bromfield subjected themselves, by
authority of Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury, to the
Benedictine Monastery of St. Peter&rsquo;s, near Gloucester,
called Lanthony Secunda, and became Benedictines, and continued
so to the time of the general dissolution of religious
houses.&nbsp; At the assizes of Salop, 20th Edward I., the prior
of Bromfield claimed free warren in the manor of Bromfield by
charter of Henry II., which was allowed.&nbsp; The said charter
also comprised a grant of Infangthef; and a jury found one Henry
de la Chapele guilty of theft, who was tried and condemned by the
prior, and hanged at Bromfield.&nbsp; The yearly revenues of the

4d.&nbsp; In the 4th of Philip and Mary it was granted to Charles
Fox.&nbsp; He was the founder of four families, most of which
were in opulence for four generations; but his estate at
Bromfield, including what is now called Oakley Park, passed by
marriage to Matthew Herbert, whose descendant George, late Earl
of Powis, devised it to his nephew, the Hon. Henry Clive, whose
representative of the same name now inherits the estate, and
resides at <span class="smcap">Oakley Park</span>, an elegant
mansion, mostly of modern construction, delightfully situated on
the banks of the Terne.&nbsp; The surrounding grounds are
extremely romantic and beautiful, and the pleasure grounds and
gardens are tastefully laid out.&nbsp; It commands many fine
views in different directions; the meanderings of the river
adding much to the effect.&nbsp; The park, which formerly
contained nine hundred acres, and included within its circuit the
priory to which it belonged, is yet of considerable extent.&nbsp;
It is finely adorned with groves and clumps of stately
oaks.&nbsp; The lordship of Bromfield is co-extensive with the
parish, and the chapelry of Walford and Dinchope, and the
township of Ledwich.&nbsp; The manor abounds with game, and is
watered by the river Terne, esteemed one of the finest fishing
streams in the kingdom.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is picturesquely
situated, and consists of nave, chancel, transept and tower: it
exhibits some fine specimens of elaborate workmanship, and is
said to have formed a part of the structure belonging to the
benedictine priory.&nbsp; The interior has a chaste and elegant
appearance; the roof is beautifully painted, and the windows are
adorned with stained glass.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage,
valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;6, now returned at

<h3>CARDINGTON</h3>
<p>is a considerable parish, in the upper division of the Munslow
Hundred, comprising upwards of 6,000 acres of land, and
containing the several townships of Cardington, Broome, Chatwall,
Comley, Enchmarsh, part of Gretton, Holt-Preen, Lydley Heys,
Plaish, and Willstone.&nbsp; At the census of 1801 the parish had
a population of 623 souls; 1831, 718; and in 1841 there were 138
houses and 691 inhabitants.&nbsp; The village of Cardington is
situated is a secluded and romantic country, three miles and a
half E.E. by N. from Church Stretton, having the lofty heights of
the Caradoc and Lawley to the east, and the Hope Bowdler hills on
the south-west.&nbsp; The township contains 995 acres of land,
the rateable value of which is &pound;815. 15s.&nbsp; Panton
Corbett, Esq., is the principal landowner; there are also a few
small freeholders.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span> is
a plain unpretending structure, consisting of nave and chancel,
with a tower, in which is a peal of bells.&nbsp; The handsome
altar tomb, erected in memory of Sir William Leighton, of Plaish,
who died December 20th, 1607, is now much dilapidated.&nbsp; He
was chief justice of North Wales, and one of the council of the
Marches of Wales, which offices he held with integrity and honour
for more than forty years.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, valued
in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;6. 2s. 6d., now returned at
&pound;294, in the patronage of Rowland Hunt, Esq.: incumbent,
Rev. William J. Hughes.&nbsp; The court leet and court baron,
with view of frank-pledge, held for the manor of Lydley and
Cardington, as a court of record, is of the highest antiquity,
and accounted a king&rsquo;s court, of which Panton Corbett,
Esq., is the present lord.&nbsp; The jurisdiction existed long
before the conquest, and the first formation of it is attributed
by several law authorities to King Alfred.&nbsp; &ldquo;The term
leet is not discoverable in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, but is
understood to be derived out of the Sheriffs&rsquo; tourn, whose
power therein was suspended, if not superseded.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
nature and extent of the court leet jurisdiction, in its first
formation, may probably be best illustrated by a brief view of
the different ranks of people and the mode of administering
justice in the Anglo-Saxon era.&nbsp; The lowest order of the
people were complete slaves, either by birth or by forfeiture of
their freedom, by crimes or breach of faith, and were incapable
of any office of trust or honour.&nbsp; But the spread of
Christianity led to the frequent manumissions, and established a
class of people called Frilazin; and persons so made free were
considered to be in a middle state only, between slaves and
freemen.&nbsp; Those who were freemen from birth were called
Ceorls, and constituted a middle class between the nobility and
such labourers and mechanics as were slaves, and being generally
devoted to agriculture, a Ceorl was the usual appellation of a
husbandman; but the acquisition of 500 acres of land, the
attainment of holy orders, or by the owner of a ship or cargo
making three voyages beyond sea, advanced a Ceorl to the dignity
of a Thane of the lower order; and the higher class of this
order, which were styled King&rsquo;s Thanes were of three
different degrees.&nbsp; The Thanes were the only nobility among
the Anglo-Saxons; but all members of royal families were of
superior rank.&nbsp; The kings were chief judges in their
respective territories, and frequently administered justice <a
name="page522"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 522</span>in
person.&nbsp; King Alfred employed both day and night in hearing
appeals, with the aid of learned assessors; thus forming a
supreme court of justice, until the establishment of monarchy,
when it was found necessary to appoint a chief justicary to
preside in the king&rsquo;s court; and the first institution of
such office is supposed to have been at the time of the incursion
of the Danes.&nbsp; In 1622, Sir John Hayward obtained from the
crown a licence to alienate the manor of Lydley and Cardington to
Edward Corbett, Esq., for the sum of &pound;3,200.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">The School</span>.&mdash;<i>William Hall</i>, by
his will, dated 6th April, 1720, bequeathed &pound;400 to the
parsons of the parishes of Cardington, Hope Bowdler, and Longnor,
in trust, for the building a schoolhouse at Cardington, and the
maintenance of a schoolmaster.&nbsp; A school was subsequently
built with part of the above mentioned legacy, and the residue
was laid out in the purchase of copyhold lands, held of the manor
of Lydley and Cardington.&nbsp; In 1827, an order was made in the
Court of Chancery, on the petition of Richard Butcher and others,
overseers and inhabitants of the parish of Cardington, whereby it
was referred to the master to take an account of the charity
estate, and of the value thereof, and to approve of a scheme for
the future management of the charity.&nbsp; The master, by his
report made April 1st, 1828, directed &pound;10 a-year to be
reserved out of the rents, to put the schoolhouse and the
premises on the school estate in good repair, and afterwards such
less sum as the directors should see fit, but not less than
&pound;5; and that the surplus rents should be paid to the
schoolmaster and his assistant.&nbsp; The school estate consists
of 27<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>.
32<span class="smcap">p</span>., and an allotment containing
5<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>.
10<span class="smcap">p</span>. on Cardington Moor, allotted to
the trustees of the school under an enclosure act, passed 41st
Geo. III.&nbsp; The estate now produces &pound;34. 3s. 1d. per
annum.&nbsp; The school is open to all the children of the parish
(boy and girls) without any charge, except 1s. for entrance and
1s. yearly for fuel.&nbsp; They are taught reading, writing, and
accounts.</p>
<p><i>Roger Maunsell</i>, by will, 1651, devised a piece of
ground, called Bowneford, in the parish of Long Stanton, to the
churchwardens of the parish of Cardington, and their successors,
and to Thomas Powell and his heirs, and ordered that the said
churchwardens, at the feast of St. Michael, should receive the
sum of 26s. 8d. yearly for ever.&nbsp; He directed the first
three years after his decease, the said sum of 26s. 8d. should be
expended in a weekly distribution of bread, to be divided among
six poor men one week, and among six poor women the following
week; and that for the next three years it should be laid out in
buying sacramental bread and wine; and the seventh year in
adorning or buying any ornament to be used in the church at
Cardington; and so from seven years to seven years.</p>
<p><i>Anne Tipton</i> gave a rent charge of &pound;1. 10s. per
annum, issuing out of the Day House, and directed six penny
loaves to be given to six poor men and six poor women of this
parish, alternately every Sunday in the year; but on Easter
Sunday, Whit Sunday, the last Sunday in the old and first Sunday
in the new year six threepenny loaves each day.</p>
<p>The sum of &pound;1. 6s. is paid every alternate year to the
churchwardens of Cardington, as a gift of <i>Dinah
Roberts</i>.&nbsp; This and the like payment made to the parish
of St. Julian, in Shrewsbury, are charged upon a farm in
Wilstone, which was purchased by Archdeacon Corbett about fifty
years ago.&nbsp; The amount is applied in a distribution of six
penny loaves every Sunday in the year in which it is
received.</p>
<p><i>Francis Southern</i>, by will, dated May 9th, 1773,
bequeathed to the minister and churchwardens of the parish of
Cardington and their successors &pound;42. 10s., upon trust, that
the interest of &pound;32. 10s., part thereof, should he laid out
in bread and given away every Lord&rsquo;s day to three poor
widows or old men of this parish, who should attend divine
service; and the interest of the other &pound;10 he left to the
minister of Cardington for preaching a sermon every New
Year&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; Of this money we are informed &pound;32.
10. was laid out in 1814 in the purchase of a cottage at the east
end of the town, called the Butt, which was formerly occupied by
poor persons placed there by the parish.&nbsp; &pound;1. 6s. is
paid from the church-warden&rsquo;s <a name="page523"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 523</span>account for providing bread for the
poor.&nbsp; The remaining &pound;10 was paid to the
churchwarden&rsquo;s account in 1819, and the churchwardens pay
the interest thereof to the minister.</p>
<p>In the parliamentary returns of 1786 it is stated the
poor&rsquo;s stock amounted to &pound;45, for which interest was
paid for many years.&nbsp; It is understood that &pound;5 of this
money was lost, and that in 1799 &pound;40 having been borrowed
of Joseph Powell by the parish for building a poor house, the
poor&rsquo;s stock was applied in paying off the debt.&nbsp;
Nothing has been paid in charity in respect of the above sum for
a long period.&nbsp; The poor, we conceive, are entitled to the
interest of the money which was left for charitable uses, and not
for the ease of the ratepayers.</p>
<p><i>John Russell</i>, by will, 1813, gave to the minister of
Cardington for the time being &pound;1 yearly for preaching a
sermon annually on the day preceding the day of his
interment.&nbsp; He also gave to the poor of Cardington thirty
threepenny loaves on each of the following
days&mdash;Christmas-day, Easter-day, Whit Sunday, and the Wakes
Sunday; and to six of the poorest widows of the parish a blue
woollen gown every Christmas-day, and the same to six of the
poorest girls of the said parish on the same day, and also to a
schoolmistress &pound;10 a year to teach twelve poor girls of the
said parish to read, knit, and sew.&nbsp; He also gave &pound;5 a
year towards a Sunday school, and he bequeathed to certain
trustees &pound;570, on trust, to place out the same in public
funds, and out of the dividends pay the annuities before
mentioned, and also an annuity to the Rev. John Witts for his
life.&nbsp; In respect of this charity there is now &pound;628.
12s. 4d. new four per cents. standing in the names of the
trustees, producing annual dividends of &pound;25. 2s. 10d.&nbsp;
The trustees, after carrying out the specific intentions of the
donor, apply the surplus in the purchase of coal, which is
distributed among the most necessitous poor.</p>
<p>There were in this parish certain lands called the Church
Estate, consisting of several detached parcels; but on the
enclosure of the lands in the manor of Lydley and Cardington, in
1817, exchanges were effected, whereby between fifteen and
sixteen acres lying together were set out by the
churchwardens.&nbsp; There are also nine cottages, chiefly
occupied by poor persons.&nbsp; The rents of these premises were
formerly paid half to the churchwardens, to be applied in the
repairs of the church, or in aid of the church rate, and the
other moiety to the overseers of the poor, by whom the amount was
given away in charity.&nbsp; But for many years the rent, now
amounting to &pound;14, has been carried to the overseers&rsquo;
account, and applied to the general purposes of the poor&rsquo;s
rate.&nbsp; Coals to the amount of &pound;5 or &pound;6 are,
however, annually given away by the overseers.&nbsp; It appears
questionable, from the usage which formerly prevailed, whether
the rent of this estate ought not to be applied, one moiety
thereof in the repairs of the church, and the other to such poor
persons as appear fit objects of charity.</p>

<h3>CHURCH STRETTON</h3>
<p>is a market town and parish in the Upper division of the
Munslow hundred, thirteen miles S.S.W. from Shrewsbury, fourteen
miles N.N.W. from Ludlow, and 153 miles from London.&nbsp; The
parish comprises the townships of Church Stretton, All Stretton,
Little Stretton, and Minton, and contains 5,717 acres of
titheable land, and 5,000 of common, making a total of 10,717
acres in the parish, the gross estimated rental of which is
&pound;7,592.&nbsp; Rateable value &pound;6,133.&nbsp; At the
census of 1801 there were 924 inhabitants; 1831, 1,302; 1841,
1,604.&nbsp; At the latter period there were 346 houses, of which
183 houses and 860 persons were in the township of Church
Stretton.&nbsp; This place is supposed to have derived the name
of Stretton (formerly Street Town), from its contiguity to the
Watling Street, the Roman road that led from Uriconium (now
Wroxeter), the principal city of the Cornavii, to Kinchester,
near Hereford.&nbsp; This ancient road runs nearly parallel with
the turnpike road from Shrewsbury to Hereford.&nbsp; The town is
small, and chiefly consists of one street, in the widest part of
which is the <a name="page525"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
525</span>market hall.&nbsp; It is a polling place for the
southern division of the county, and is situated in a picturesque
vale, from which rise gradually wooded eminences of great beauty,
backed by lofty ranges of hills.&nbsp; On the eastern side are
the Lawley and the far-famed Caer Caradoc, one of the military
entrenchments of Caractacus in his long and arduous struggle with
the Romans; on the western side is the lofty range of the
Longmynds, extending eight or nine miles, and on the summit of
one called Boddbury was a Roman station or camp of
observation.&nbsp; A pole has been erected on the highest point
of the Longmynds, from which spot there is a most delightful and
commanding view of a wide extent of country.&nbsp; The prospect
includes on the west the Stipperstones, the mountainous district
of Wales, including the Sugarloaf near Abergavenny, the Table
mountain, Cader Idris, and the intervening range from that
mountain to Snowdon; on the east and north-east are seen the
Edgwood, the Clee, and Malvern hills, and the majestic Wrekin; to
the south-west are the hills of Radnorshire, and on the
north-west the Denbighshire hills, besides which there is a fine
view of the fertile plains of Shropshire, with many other objects
of deep interest.&nbsp; The secluded and romantic situation of
Church Stretton, the grand and majestic character of the
surrounding scenery&mdash;its proximity to scenes of great
historical interest&mdash;the mildness and salubrity of the air,
which is at the same time peculiarly bracing,&mdash;its general
exemption from contagious and epidemic disease, and the
excellence of the water, all conduce to render it peculiarly
attractive to parties in pursuit of health and pleasure.&nbsp;
During the summer months it is a very favourite resort of
visitors from the neighbouring towns, the great variety of the
scenery rendering it almost impossible to weary the most
fastidious taste.&nbsp; When it has become more easy of access by
railway it will no doubt become a favourite retreat for persons
from all parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; The Shrewsbury and Hereford
railway now in course of construction will pass within three
hundred yards of the town.</p>
<p>Camden, who wrote in the time of Elizabeth observes,
&ldquo;Near Stretton, in a valley are yet to be seen the rubbish
of an old castle called Brocard&rsquo;s Castle and the same set
amiddest greene meadowes that before time were fish
ponds.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the 17th of King John, Hugh de Mortimer
received command from the Barons to deliver up the castle of
Stretton Dale to Hugh de Neville, but standing firm to the king
he was rewarded the next year by receiving a grant of the castle
of Holdgate from John.&nbsp; The Caer Caradoc probably acquired
that name from having been one of the military stations of
Caractacus, and it was once considered the place where he fought
his last battle until a strict comparison of its situation, with
the description given by Tacitus, caused the opinion to be
abandoned.&nbsp; Formerly a society of gentlemen used to meet
annually on this hill to celebrate the fame of the British chief
in compositions of prose and verse.&nbsp; A very spirited
poetical effusion was on occasion delivered almost extempore by
the Rev. Sneyd Davies.&nbsp; Almost every dingle and narrow
valley of this locality has its peculiar brook or rivulet, which
in several instances form beautiful cascades over their rocky
channel; they all produce excellent trout.&nbsp; At the foot of
the Caradoc, near All Stretton, is a farm house called Botvylle
which a family of that name at an early period held under the
Knights Templars of Jerusalem.&nbsp; One of this family was a
lawyer, and was called John of the Inns, which was corrupted into
John Thynne, and from him there is a tradition that the family of
the Marquis of Bath is descended, who possessed the manor till
the year 1808, when it was sold to Thomas Coleman, Esq.&nbsp; In
the 10th of Edward III. the king bestowed Stretton on Richard,
Earl of Arundel, and the year following he obtained the grant of
a market on Thursday, and a fair on the eve, the day, and the day
after the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.&nbsp; The
market is still held on Thursday, and is well attended with
provisions.&nbsp; Fairs are held on the Monday before Shrewsbury
first March fair; 14th May, 3rd of July, for wool, 25th of
September, and the last Thursday in November.&nbsp; The Market
Hall is a neat and spacious building in the Elizabethan style,
consisting of a good room where public meetings are held, and an
area underneath for the market.&nbsp; It was erected in the year
1839, <a name="page526"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 526</span>at
a cost of about &pound;1000, and was conveyed to the following
trustees, some of whom were the principal subscribers to the
funds for its erection, namely: the Earl of Powis, Lord
Darlington, Lord Clive, Hon. R. H. Clive, Rev. N. R. Pemberton,
E. W. Smythe Owen, Esq., G. R. Benson, Esq., Panton Corbett,
Esq., Thomas S. Acton, Esq., E. B. Coleman, Esq., William
Pinches, Esq., Mr. John Broome, and Mr. John Robinson.&nbsp; The
old market hall, an antique structure much admired for its
primitive appearance, was chiefly composed of timber and
plaister, and was built in the year 1617; it was fast falling to
decay when it was taken down; the inhabitants purchased the site
and the tolls for &pound;200, which was raised by subscriptions,
so that the market is now toll free.&nbsp; In a deep valley about
a quarter of a mile from the town is a flourishing flannel
manufactory, the machinery being turned by a mountain stream; the
inhabitants are however chiefly engaged in agricultural pursuits;
large flocks of sheep are pastured on the neighbouring
hills.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Moses George Benson,
Esq., Charles Orlando Childe Pemberton, Esq., and Mrs. Coleman;
the latter is lady of the manor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, an ancient cruciform
structure with a central tower, chiefly in the early English
style of architecture, is dedicated to St. Lawrence, having an
image of that saint in the eastern angle of the tower.&nbsp; The
tower exhibits some elaborate workmanship, and contains a very
melodious peal of bells and an excellent clock.&nbsp; On the
north and south sides of the edifice are doorways of Norman
character.&nbsp; The tower is supported by four clustered pillars
and pointed arches, which divide the nave, chancel, and
transepts.&nbsp; The chancel is beautifully ornamented with
richly carved oak in antique devices, collected at a considerable
cost by the late rector, the Rev. Robert N. Pemberton, who
bestowed great care and expense in the embellishment of the
sacred edifice.&nbsp; In the centre compartment of the altar is
an elegant and well carved representation of Christ after the
crucifixion.&nbsp; The windows, principally in the decorated
style, with rich and flowing tracery, are beautified with stained
glass.&nbsp; The eastern one is peculiarly chaste and elegant,
and being immediately over the altar gives the interior a very
chastened and effective appearance.&nbsp; The centre division
contains a fine figure of our Saviour, and on one side is a
representation of St. Peter, and on the other of St. John.&nbsp;
This window was the gift of the late rector, the Rev. R. N.
Pemberton.&nbsp; The living is a rectory, rated in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;15. 10s., in the patronage of C. O.
C. Pemberton, Esq.; incumbent, Rev. Hugh Owen Wilson.&nbsp; The
tithes are commuted for &pound;505, and there is a glebe land
attached to the rectory, of the annual value of &pound;60.&nbsp;
The parish is in the diocese of Hereford, and the triennial
visitation is held here by the bishop.&nbsp; The visitation in
the intermediate years is held by the archdeacon.&nbsp; Roger
Mainwaring, D.D., vicar of St. Giles in the Fields, and chaplain
to King Charles I., was born in this town.&nbsp; His two sermons,
entitled &ldquo;Religion and Allegiance,&rdquo; were censured in
parliament, and he was afterwards imprisoned and suspended for
three years.&nbsp; In 1633 the king presented him to the rich
rectory of Stanford Rivers, in Essex, made him dean of Worcester,
and in 1635 he was consecrated bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, which
see he held till the bishopric was abolished.&nbsp; He was
cruelly dealt with by the prevailing powers in the time of
anarchy and confusion, and died in 1653, leaving behind him the
character of a person of great learning and true piety.</p>
<p>There is a Branch Savings Bank at Church Stretton, which
commenced in the year 1821, the business of which is conducted at
the school house every Friday.&nbsp; About 300 depositors have
their names in the books, and a sum of about &pound;9,000

Fellows of the Manchester Unity have a lodge here, with their

class="smcap">The Church Stretton Union Workhouse</span> is
situated nearly a quarter of a mile from the town, on the
Shrewsbury and Ludlow turnpike road, and in the immediate
vicinity of the Longmynd hills.&nbsp; The situation is remarkably
dry and salubrious, and the building is admirably contrived for
the convenience and comfort of the inmates.&nbsp; The building is
in the form of a cross, which, with the outer wall, forms four
quadrangles, and these are used as airing yards.&nbsp; It was
built in 1838, of the rough stone got from the neighbouring
quarries, with quoins and cornices of hewn free stone.&nbsp; The
cost of the structure was &pound;2,000, and the sum of &pound;200
was paid for the site and land attached, which covers an area of
about two acres.&nbsp; The money necessary for the erection was
borrowed, and it was agreed to pay back the principal by
instalments of &pound;100 per annum: there remains unpaid at the
present time &pound;600.&nbsp; The parishes comprised within the
union are, Acton Scott, Church Stretton, Cardington, Easthope,
Eaton, Hope Bowdler, Leebotwood, Longnor, Rushbury, Shipton,
Sibdon, Carwood, Smethcott, Wistanston, and Woolstaston.&nbsp;
The house is capable of accommodating 110 inmates, and the
guardians meet at the board room every fortnight for the
transaction of the business connected with the union.&nbsp; The
expenditure for the half year ending Lady day, 1850, was
&pound;1,266. 16s., and the average weekly cost per head of the
in-door paupers was 2s. 1&frac12;d., of which 3d. was for
clothing.&nbsp; The number of in-door paupers at the same period
was 55.&nbsp; John Belton, <i>Clerk to the Guardians</i>.&nbsp;

<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;There is a school
and schoolhouse in the town of Church Stretton, built in 1779 on
the site of an old school, supposed to have been erected on the
waste land by subscription, and another room has since been added
thereto.&nbsp; By an act of parliament, passed 28th George III.,
for enclosing the commons and waste lands in the manor of Church
Stretton, it was enacted that all encroachments which had
heretofore been made on the said commons and waste lands, for the
use of the school and schoolmaster at Church Stretton, should be
confirmed by the commissioners to the rector of the parish for
the time being, together with nine other persons therein named,
and their successors to be appointed as therein directed, on
trust to receive the rents and apply the same to the use of the
schoolmaster as an augmentation of his salary, and to permit such
master to occupy the buildings for the uses for which they were
intended.&nbsp; In pursuance of this act the commissioners
allotted a parcel of land containing 27<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 29<span
class="smcap">p</span>., (including a road containing about one
acre), which was let, when the charity commissioners published
their report, for the yearly sum of &pound;27.</p>
<p>The following legacies have at different periods been left for
the benefit of the school, viz:&mdash;Sir Rowland Hayward, Knt.
&pound;1. 13s. 4d. yearly, payable out of certain lands in the
parish.&nbsp; In respect of the charity of <i>Thomas
Bridgman</i>, 40s. yearly is paid to the schoolmaster for
teaching four poor children.&nbsp; From <i>Lloyd&rsquo;s
Charity</i> the trustees receive the sum of &pound;2. 5s., and
&pound;3. 3s. yearly for the support of a Sunday school.&nbsp;
The trustees also receive &pound;4. 10s. yearly from
<i>Mainwaring&rsquo;s Charity</i>, and &pound;2. 1s. annually
from the churchwardens.&nbsp; The whole annual income derived
from these sources amounts to &pound;42. 12s. 4d.&nbsp; The
schoolmaster is appointed by the trustees, and receives a salary
of &pound;40 a year, and resides in a house free of expense, and
for these emoluments he also teaches a Sunday school.&nbsp; The
school is conducted on the national system: about 60 boys and 60
girls attend.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Hawkes</i>, by will dated 19th August, 1703, left
&pound;30 to the use of the poor of the parish of Church
Stretton, to be laid out in land; the yearly produce thereof to
be distributed in bread as follows; viz: eight penny loaves every
Sunday, and sixteen penny loaves every first Sunday in the year,
Easter Sunday, and Whit-Sunday, to such poor persons as should
frequent the church.&nbsp; The aforesaid sum of &pound;30 was
laid out in 1708 in the purchase of a copyhold tenement situated
in Church Stretton, called Walter&rsquo;s <a
name="page528"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 528</span>House,
formerly used as a poor-house, in respect of which 30s. is paid
yearly as <i>Hawke&rsquo;s Legacy</i> out of the poor&rsquo;s
rates, and applied with the produce of other charities hereafter
noticed.</p>
<p><i>By Indenture</i>, bearing date 3rd May, 1684, <i>John
Garratt</i> and <i>Henry Richards</i> conveyed a meadow,
containing by estimation two acres, in the township of Little
Stretton to Thomas Hawkes and others, and their heirs on trust,
that they should succour and relieve (with the yearly rents and
profits) such poor of the said parish as they thought most
needy.&nbsp; The meadow called Little Stretton Pools, containing
1<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>.
2<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, is let at a yearly rent
of &pound;5, which is distributed amongst the poor with the other
charities.</p>
<p><i>On the table</i> of benefactions, it is stated that
<i>Randolph Jones</i>, in 1710, left &pound;10, the interest to
be distributed in bread.&nbsp; This money is supposed to have
been laid out in building the poor-house, and the interest
thereof, 10s., is paid yearly from the poor&rsquo;s rates, and
forms part of the funds distributed in bread at Easter and
Christmas.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Bridgman</i>, by will dated 28th May, 1718, devised
to the school at Church Stretton 40s. yearly, to be paid at
Michaelmas and Lady-day to the schoolmaster, on condition that he
should teach four poor children till they could perfectly read in
the Bible, and then to receive four more, to be nominated from
the parish by his executors and trustees, and the minister of the
parish.&nbsp; He also gave to the poor housekeepers of Church
Stretton 20s., to be given on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day; and also
10s. more to be distributed in twenty sixpenny loaves to
housekeepers of the said parish, not receiving parochial
relief.</p>
<p><i>Edward Phillips</i>, by indenture bearing date 19th May,
1735, left land to the amount of 2<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 10<span class="smcap">p</span>.
called the Street Meadow, in trust to apply the annual rent of
the same for the benefit of the poor.&nbsp; This land was let in
1830 at a rent of &pound;7, which forms part of the general
distribution on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day and Easter.</p>
<p><i>Edward Lloyd</i>, who died in 1790, bequeathed &pound;100,
to be placed out at interest, half the produce to be paid to the
schoolmaster, as an augmentation to his salary, and the other
half to be applied towards raising a sum to apprentice two boys
of the age of 14 scholars of the said school.&nbsp; He also gave
&pound;21, on trust, to place out the same to pay the interest to
sixteen poor parishioners of Church Stretton, on St.
Thomas&rsquo;s day, to be nominated by the minister and
churchwardens.&nbsp; The testator also charged his estate, called
The Bank, in Church Stretton, with the payment of &pound;3. 3s.
yearly to the trustees of Church Stretton school, for the aid and
support of a Sunday school there.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;100 is
placed out on a bond, given out under the provisions of an act of
parliament, passed for rebuilding St. Chad&rsquo;s church,
Shrewsbury, bearing interest at 4&frac12; per cent.&nbsp; One
moiety is paid to the trustees of the school, as before stated;
and the other is carried to a separate account, called the
apprentice fund, from which children are placed out as
apprentices, with a premium of &pound;4 each.</p>
<p><i>John Bridgman</i>, by will, dated 5th October, 1796,
bequeathed &pound;100, in trust, to the minister and
churchwardens of Church Stretton, to be by them placed out at
interest, on such security as they should think proper, and
distributed by them on the 28th of March to poor
housekeepers.</p>
<p><i>Edward Phillips</i>, <i>jun.</i>, by will, dated 22nd of
September, 1781, gave to the parish of Church Stretton the sum of
&pound;30, to be laid out in land, and the produce thereof to be
given in bread to poor housekeepers.&nbsp; The yearly sum of
&pound;1. 10s. has been considered as a charge upon land in
Church Stretton, belonging to the Rev. Robert Norgrave Pemberton,
which was formerly the property of the family of Phillips.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. John Mainwaring</i>, by will, dated 12th of May,
1800, and by a codicil, dated 5th October, 1805, directed that
the sum of &pound;100 should be invested in the purchase of stock
in the public funds, the interest whereof to be applied to the
relief of poor industrious persons residing in the parish as
should be thought most deserving; and also &pound;100, the
interest whereof to be paid to the master of the Church Stretton
school, in augmentation <a name="page529"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 529</span>of his salary; and he also directed
that &pound;21 should he laid out in the purchase of stock, the
interest to be paid to such person as should have the keeping of
the churchyard in order, on condition that the parishioners of
Church Stretton should continue the yearly payment of 8s. or 10s.
hitherto allowed for that purpose.&nbsp; Interest is paid on
these sums at 4&frac12; per cent.</p>
<p>The preceding charities, amounting to &pound;27. 1s., are
carried to one general fund, of which &pound;4 are disposed of in
bread&mdash;20s. worth every St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, the like sum
every Easter Tuesday, and 40s. towards a distribution of eighteen
pennyworth of bread three Sundays in every month, the residue
being paid from the parish rates.&nbsp; The remainder, &pound;23.
1s., with the money collected at the sacrament, and some
voluntary additions thereto, are distributed to the poor at
Easter and on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, in nearly equal
proportions.</p>
<p><i>William Minton</i>, in 1701, left &pound;6, the interest to
be distributed in bread every Christmas day.&nbsp; The amount of
6s. is given away in twopenny and threepenny loaves before
evening service on the aforesaid day.&nbsp; It is stated, on the
table of benefactions, that <i>Thomas Harrison</i>, in 1794, left
&pound;10, the interest to be given to the poor on St.
Thomas&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; <i>Widow Owen</i> left &pound;1 yearly,
payable from certain houses in Mardol, in Shrewsbury, to repair
the west window of Stretton church.&nbsp; At the time the Charity
Commissioners published their report, there was a surplus of
upwards of &pound;9 ready to be applied to the repair of the
aforesaid window.</p>

answered.&nbsp; Arriving at Church Stretton, he made the same
inquiry: &ldquo;Stretton, Sire,&rdquo; was again the reply.&nbsp;

<h3>DIDDLEBURY</h3>
<p>is an extensive parish in the lower division of the Munslow
hundred, which comprises the townships of Corfton, Diddlebury,
Earnstrey Park, Lawton and Little Sutton, Lower Parks and
Broncroft, Middlehope Paston, Peaton, Sutton Great and Westhope,
together containing 9,043 acres of land: population in 1801, 837;
1831, 920; 1841, 896; at the latter period there were 190
houses.&nbsp; The village of Diddlebury is pleasantly situated
seven miles and a half north from Ludlow, and in 1841 had 25
houses and 132 inhabitants.&nbsp; The township contains 1,149
acres of Land; rateable value, &pound;1,191. 16s. 8d.&nbsp; The
principal landowners are the Cornewall family, James Davies,
Esq., Mr. E. Lodge, William A. Roberts, Esq., and George Wood,
Esq.&nbsp; There was formerly an alien priory at Diddlebury,
which was subordinate to the convent of Seez, in Normandy, and
was afterwards appropriated to the abbey of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The
church, dedicated to St. Peter, consists of nave and chancel, and
has a square tower, in which are five bells: there are several
memorials, chiefly to the family of Cornewall.&nbsp; The living
is a vicarage, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;12. 1s.
3d.; now returned at &pound;384; in the patronage of the dean and
chapter of Hereford; incumbent, Rev. Thomas Underwood.&nbsp;
There is a National school in the village, attended by about
forty scholars.&nbsp; The tithes of this township have been
commuted, and &pound;35 apportioned to the vicar, and &pound;45.
10s. to <a name="page533"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
533</span>the dean and chapter of Hereford.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Delbury Hall</span>, in this township, the property
of Herbert Cornewall, Esq., and residence of Henry Wood, Esq., is
said to have formerly belonged to the monks of Wenlock Abbey,
from whom it passed to the family of Baldwin, whose monuments are
in the chancel of Diddlebury church.&nbsp; It was purchased by
Captain Cornewall, father of the late bishop of Worcester, and
grandfather of the present proprietor.&nbsp; There has existed a
school at Diddlebury every since the year 1595.&nbsp; Lord
Herbert, of Chirbury, was partly educated at this school in his
youth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;The parish
officers are in possession of a house which was purchased in 1720
for &pound;150, of which, &pound;128 was money belonging to the
parishioners of Diddlebury; the residue &pound;22 was borrowed of
Philip Luttley.&nbsp; After paying of interest for the said
&pound;22, it was agreed to appropriate the rent in equal
moieties to the support of a school, and to the benefit of the
poor.&nbsp; At a meeting of the parishioners, held May 13th,
1830, it was resolved that the clear rents (then &pound;8 per
annum) should in future be applied to the support of a Sunday
school.&nbsp; There was a sum of &pound;21 in the hands of Mr.
Beddoes when the charity commissioners published their report,
for which he paid &pound;4 a year as the interest; but it is not
known from whose gift this charity was derived.&nbsp; This money
has been improperly, as it seems to us, carried to the
poor&rsquo;s rate; but at the parish meeting above mentioned it
has been determined to apply the interest also for the benefit of
the school.</p>
<p><i>Mary Valentine</i>, by her will, bearing date 23rd May,
1822, bequeathed to the minister, churchwardens, and overseers of
the poor of the parish of Diddlebury, &pound;1,000 four per cent.
consols, to be transferred into their names as trustees, the
dividends to be laid out in bread, and distributed every Sunday
to poor housekeepers of this parish not receiving parochial
relief.&nbsp; The dividends, amounting to &pound;35 per annum,
are received through a bank at London.&nbsp; The income is
applied in a weekly distribution of bread amongst all the poor
belonging the parish, and not receiving parochial relief; some
who are not resident in the parish being included.&nbsp; For the
purpose of regulating the distribution, the parish is divided
into three districts; and about twenty-six persons from each
district in rotation receive a sixpenny loaf each every third
Sunday.</p>
<p>The principal residents are John Child, farmer; Mrs. Mary
Downes, Melford Lodge; Henry Wood, Esq., Delbury hall; John
Morris, farmer; Frederick North, schoolmaster.</p>
<h3>CORFTON</h3>
<p>is a township and village in the parish of Diddlebury,
containing 1,205 acres of land, and in 1841 had 48 houses and 232
inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;1,453. 3s. 4d.&nbsp;
The tithes of Corfton and Sparchford are commuted for &pound;116.
17s.&nbsp; The church of Culmington, with the manors of Corfeham,
Culmington, Erneston, and Les Clyves, were held by Walter de
Clifford of King Henry II., by the service of one knight&rsquo;s
fee, paying &pound;31 rent.&nbsp; &ldquo;This Walter was the
father of Fair Rosamond, the mistress of Henry II., and mother of
the noted William, Earl of Salisbury, whom she bore to the
king.&nbsp; Walter de Clifford, grandson of the first Walter,
espousing the cause of Richard Mareschal, Earl of Pembroke, then
in rebellion, was outlawed 17th of Henry III., and his castle and
manor of Corfeham seized by the sheriff of Shropshire for the
king&rsquo;s use; but restored to him shortly after upon his
submission.&nbsp; He married the daughter of Lewelin, Prince of
Wales, relict of John de Braose, and left issue by her one
daughter, first married to William Longspe, Earl of Sarum, who
had with her in frank marriage Culmington, in the county of
Salop, valued at &pound;28. 8s. 2d. per annum, with this proviso,
that in case it did not yield the sum aforesaid, the deficiency
was to be made up out of the manor of Corfeham: the whole estate
given to her in frank marriage being &pound;200 per annum.&nbsp;
After the decease of the Earl of Sarum, her second husband was
John Giffard, of Brimsfield, Knt., of whom she complained to the
king, that he had taken her by force out of her own castle and
carried her to his at Brimsfield, where she was kept in
duress.&nbsp; <a name="page534"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
534</span>To this accusation Sir John Gifford made answer that he
had the free consent of the countess, as the sequel would prove,
and so tendered the king a fine of three hundred marks for
marrying the lady without licence, which was accepted in
satisfaction of the contempt, if the countess made no further
application upon that score.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would appear,
therefore, that the ancient owners of the manor were the
daughters of the Fair Rosamond.</p>
<p>The principal residents in Corfton are Richard Bowen, farmer,
Hill house; Edward Bowen, farmer, Lower house; James Beddoes,
farmer, Sparchford; Mary Dyer, vict., Sun Inn; Edward Pearce,

<h3>EASTHOPE</h3>
<p>is a parish and small rural village, situated in Hopedale, in
the lower division of the Munslow hundred, five miles south-west
from the ancient town of Much Wenlock, eight miles east from
Church Stretton, and ten miles west from Bridgnorth.&nbsp; The
parish contains 815 acres of land, the rateable value of which is
&pound;803.&nbsp; At the census in 1801 there were 85
inhabitants; 1831, 103; and in 1841, 21 houses and a population
of 103 souls.&nbsp; In the 34th Edward I. John de Easthope died
seized of the manor of Easthope, 18th of Edward II. a fine was
levied between Thomas de Easthope and John de Hopton defendant,
of the manor and of the advowson of the church, to the use of
Thomas and Joanna his wife in fee tail.&nbsp; The 21st of Richard
II. Richard Earl of Arundel was found to have a knight&rsquo;s
fee in Easthope, holden then by Thomas de Hynkeley.&nbsp; In the
12th of Henry VII. a fine was levied between Henry Warley and
Nicholas Warley complainants, John Haltman and his wife
defendants, of both the manor and advowson of the church <i>et de
terris</i> in Easthope, Presthope, Astwale, Louthwyche, Willey,
Bratton, Henley, and Bould.&nbsp; Moses George Benson, Esq. is
the principal landowner and lord of the manor; the soil is mostly
upon the limestone, and there is a good deal of limestone rock in
the parish and neighbourhood.&nbsp; The water is very good and
some of the springs are accounted efficacious in scorbutic
complaints, and are also of a petrifying quality.&nbsp; The
scenery is beautifully diversified and romantic, and some of the
high grounds command fine views of the celebrated Wrekin, the
Clee hill, and Caradoc, so named after Caractacus, who had a camp
on the summit.&nbsp; The Wenlock edge is a great feature in this
part of the country; it is a steep wooded acclivity which runs
nearly through the centre of the parish, and is of an interesting
nature to the geologist.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a small structure
unpretending in its architecture, and dedicated to St.
Peter.&nbsp; It has a short tower, and there is a
well-proportioned window in the east end in the early English
style: the font is very ancient.&nbsp; On the north side of the
church, between two venerable yews, are two tombs without date or
inscription but simply a cross upon each.&nbsp; It is supposed
that two monks are interred there, who might be connected with
the Abbey of Wenlock.&nbsp; The stones have given rise to some
curious legends among the people.&nbsp; The living is a rectory
valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;3. 3s. 1&frac12;d., now
returned at &pound;133, in the patronage of M. G. Benson, Esq.;
incumbent, Rev. Robert Armitage.&nbsp; The rectory is a neat
structure in a sheltered situation, and there are thirty-six
acres of glebe land.</p>
<p>On some rising ground situated about a mile west of the
turnpike road leading from Wenlock to Ludlow, and about half way
between Larden Hall and Lutwyche Hall, is a celebrated British
encampment.&nbsp; It encloses about eight acres, and the form is
nearly a circle, surrounded by inner and outer fosses; the inner
wall falls on the side due east twelve feet, externally
twenty-five feet, across the crest of the parapet, six
feet.&nbsp; The relief of the second <a name="page536"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 536</span>vallum rises ten feet from the foss,
and is at present twelve feet wide across its parapet; externally
it falls eight feet.&nbsp; It is however partially obliterated,
either in consequence of the mounds and ditches being planted
over, or through their being injured by natural causes.&nbsp;
These ditches have formerly been a post of some importance, for
they supply a necessary link in the chain of British
entrenchments which stretch throughout the country.&nbsp; The
present position is in the immediate view of Nordy Bank, and
within observation of both the Caers Bury ditches and the
Wrekin.&nbsp; The entrance appears to have been on the north-east
side.&nbsp; Were there no other reason for the assumption, the
fact of a British urn having been found here would sanction the
idea that these were the works of the ancient Britons.&nbsp; A
little to the north-west is the semblance of a tumulus, which a
few years ago was more prominent than at present; on a recent
occasion after making a cut from west to east, the workmen came
to a black deposit which led to the supposition that the
interment had been simple, and by cremation.&nbsp; On a previous
occasion by mere accident an earthen vessel was found by making a
drain about three hundred yards south-east from the
encampment.&nbsp; It was formed of a sort of red clay so slightly
baked on the outside that it washed away when a brush and water
were applied to it.&nbsp; The inside was black and somewhat
harder as though it had been baked by making the fire
within.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before I saw it,&rdquo; says Mr. Mytton,
&ldquo;the workmen had broken the lower part which was next the
surface of the ground, but by putting the pieces together the
form could be made out.&nbsp; It was found with the mouth
downwards, and contained fragments of bones.&nbsp; At seems most
likely that Astorius made a diversion of part of his forces
against Caer Caradoc and the ditches, and after having driven out
the Britons from those elevated posts he left garrisons in the
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mogg, or Mock Forest, in which the camp
is situated, is reckoned among the ancient forests of this
county.</p>
<p>The principal gentleman&rsquo;s seat in this parish is <span
class="smcap">Lutwyche Hall</span>, built by Judge Lutwyche, in
the time of Queen Elizabeth; a full length portrait of the judge
adorns an apartment inside the mansion.&nbsp; It is supposed that
there has been a mansion at Lutwyche from the time of, or
probably earlier than the Conquest.&nbsp; It was sold in 1786 by
the last of the Lutwyches, and after passing through several
intermediate owners was purchased in 1806 by Moses Benson, Esq.,
whose grandson Moses George Benson, Esq. now resides there.&nbsp;
The derivation of the word Lutwyche is said to be from
<i>lut</i>, the gathering of an army, and <i>wyche</i>, a cleft
or valley.</p>
<p>The chief residents in Easthope are Moses George Benson, Esq.,
Lutwyche Hall; The Rev. Robert Armitage, The Rectory; Edward
Evans, shoemaker; Samuel Evans, farmer; Edward Preece,
wheelwright; Francis Ray, farmer; Easthope Cottage; Margaret
Wadlow, farmer and corn miller.</p>

<h3>HOLDGATE</h3>
<p>is a parish in the lower division of the Munslow Hundred,
which embraces the townships of Holdgate, Bouldon, and
Brookhampton, and contains 1,623 acres of land.&nbsp; Population
in 1801, 197; in 1831, 188; 1841, 224.&nbsp; At the latter period
there were forty houses.&nbsp; The village of Holdgate seems once
to have been a place of some note, and stands on rising ground,
eleven miles north from Ludlow.&nbsp; The township comprises 649
acres of land, the rateable value of which is &pound;854.&nbsp;
At the census of 1841 there were 12 houses and 79
inhabitants.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Mrs. Thursby,
Rev. Joseph Corbett, and George Phillips, Esq.&nbsp; The former
is lady of the manor.&nbsp; There was anciently a castle
here.&nbsp; Thomas Maudit being in arms with the rebellious
barons, his castle was seized by the king and given to Hugh de
Mortimer, but returning to his allegiance he had restitution of
his castle at Holgot.&nbsp; In the 7th of Henry III., he obtained
the charter for a market there every week upon a Thursday.&nbsp;
After him William Maudit had a confirmation of the grant of the
market.&nbsp; In the 19th of Edward <a name="page538"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 538</span>I. Robert Burnel, bishop of Bath and
Wells, procured a charter for changing the market day to Tuesday,
and to keep a fair on the eve, the day, and on the day after the
feast of the Holy Trinity.&nbsp; In the 15th of Richard II., Hugh
Burnel, Knt., held the castle and manor of Holdgate at the yearly
rent of &pound;2. 13s. 3&frac14;d., which was assessed upon
several tenants at Clee St. Margaret.&nbsp; The service for the
manor was to find two horsemen at Montgomery for forty
days.&nbsp; The heiress of Burnel married Lord Lovell in the time
of Edward II., in which family the inheritance rested till
Jasper, of Hatfield, Earl of Pembroke, obtained a grant hereof in
special trial, who, after the battle of Bosworth, was created
duke of Bedford; but dying without issue, in the 24th of Henry
VIII. the king gave the manor to Thomas, duke of Norfolk, and his
heirs, to be held by the fourth part of a knight&rsquo;s
fee.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to
the Holy Trinity, is evidently of Norman architecture, having the
massive and lofty embattled tower peculiar to that style, adorned
with rude figures, which may go far to prove the antiquity of the
edifice.&nbsp; The principal entrance is through a fine stone
doorway, with a cluster of slender pillars on each side,
supporting a beautifully carved arch, the effect of which is
considerably lessened by several coats of whitewash.&nbsp; The
font is of primitive simplicity and curiously sculptured, seems
coeval with the building itself, but is seen under similar
disadvantage.&nbsp; The back of a large pew is ornamented with
the coat of arms, handsomely carved in wood, of the family of
Minton, who formerly resided at the Coates, in this parish.&nbsp;
Near to the church-yard is an artificial mound called &ldquo;The
Mount.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was probably thrown up to its present
height for the purpose of erecting a watch-tower, or post, during
the civil wars, or in the unsettled times when the warlike barons
of the feudal system were perpetually invading each other&rsquo;s

Holdgate.&nbsp; Thomas Maudit released to him the right of
patronage in two parts of the church; yet he reserved the third
part to himself, for which he presented to the bishop his

20th of King Edward I., upon a <i>quo warranto</i> against him,
was adjudged to have free warren in this manor, with the liberty
of a fair and market both granted by the king.&nbsp; The manor
was afterwards carried in marriage by an heiress of the Burnels
to John, Lord Lovel, in whose family it continued till the
attainder of Francis Lord Viscount Lovel, who was slain on the
16th of June, 3rd of Henry VII., at the battle of Stoke, near
Newark-upon-Trent.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>
consists of nave and chancel, with a tower in which are three
bells.&nbsp; In the 40th of Henry III. the parson of Hope Bullers
impleaded the prior of Wenlock for estovers in the prior&rsquo;s
wood of Sutley and Eastwood, and for the common of pasture in the
said woods lying in Eaton, as appendant to the church of Hope
Bullers.&nbsp; The Prior pleaded that Stephen de Hope, patron of
the church about twenty-five years past, dissiezed the prior of
the said woods, and a verdict was accordingly granted to the
prior.&nbsp; The living is a rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;6. 13s. 4d., now &pound;228, in the patronage of
certain trustees: incumbent, Rev. George W. Marsh.</p>

given in money on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day; that, upon the death of
his predecessor about twenty-four years ago, he applied to his
representatives for the principal, and ultimately received from
them &pound;18.&nbsp; This sum Mr. Marsh states he now has in his
hands, that he has added thereto &pound;4, so as to make up
&pound;22, and has signed a memorandum to that effect in one of
the parish books.&nbsp; He pays 22s. yearly as the interest

<p>is a parish and village situated about a mile from Ludlow, and
separated from that town by the river Teme, which is here crossed
by a stone bridge.&nbsp; This parish is partly in the county of
Hereford and partly in Salop.&nbsp; The entire parish at the
census of 1801 had 34 inhabitants; 1831, 528, and in 1841 there
were 46 houses and 294 inhabitants within the bounds of this
county.&nbsp; Acres, 2,920.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;3,290.
10s.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ludford House</span>, the seat and
property of Francis Lechmere Charlton, Esq., is a fine old
mansion, situated on a gentle eminence contiguous to the
village.&nbsp; Though greatly modernized, its interior quadrangle
and the massive style of masonry, are indications of great
antiquity.&nbsp; The proprietor has in his possession a deed in
which mention is made of a house here as early as the eleventh
century.&nbsp; This manor in the time of William the Conqueror
was possessed by Osborne, Lord of Richards Castle.&nbsp; It was
afterwards enjoyed by the Jordens, from whom it passed by an
heiress to Howel Vaughan.&nbsp; The hospital of St. John being
seized by the crown at the time of the dissolution of religious
houses, this manor, as appertaining to that foundation, was also
conveyed to King Henry VIII.&nbsp; In the time of Edward VI. it
was granted to John Earl of Warwick, from whom it passed by sale
to William Foxe, and in the year 1607 came into the possession of
the Charlton family.&nbsp; This family enjoyed extensive
possessions in this county, and were seated at Apleby Castle,
near Wellington.&nbsp; To the south of the house are tasteful
gardens and pleasure grounds, and on the western side is the
park, well stocked with deer, and remarkable for its fine sylvan
beauty and luxuriant woody scenery.&nbsp; Leland, who visited
Ludford between the years 1500 and 1550, observes, &ldquo;The
suburbs over Teme bridge by south is called Ludford, and in it is
a little parish church.&nbsp; There be three fayre arches in this
bridge over Teme, and a pretty chapel upon it of St.
Catherine.&nbsp; It is about 100 years since this stone bridge
was erected.&nbsp; Men passed along by a ford a little below the
bridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>, an
ancient structure, is situated in the county of Hereford,
contiguous to Ludford house, and consists of nave and chancel,
with a square tower.&nbsp; The altar and basons for holy water
indicate that Catholicism had not declined at the time of its
erection.&nbsp; The chancel is evidently a modern appendage to
the church, and was built by William Foxe, who formerly resided
at Ludford house.&nbsp; It is the place of sepulchre for several
members of the Foxe family, and also of the Charltons.&nbsp; In a
recess is the figure of Sir Job Charlton, reclining in his
magisterial habiliments.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy,
returned at &pound;105 in the patronage of F. L. Charlton,
Esq.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ludford Hospital</span> was
founded by Sir Job Charlton in the year 1672 for six poor and
impotent persons, one of whom was to be warden; the incorporation
to be denominated, &ldquo;The warden and poor of the hospital of
Ludford,&rdquo; The said warden and poor in their corporate
capacity to have power to purchase and hold lands, and to sue and
be sued, and to have a common seal.&nbsp; The name and
distinction of warden as head of the corporation has long ceased
to exist.&nbsp; The latest instance of the use of the common seal
is on a lease of Saunder&rsquo;s meadow in 1618.&nbsp; The
subsequent lease bears the seal of Sir Francis Charlton.&nbsp;
The income is about &pound;63 per annum.&nbsp; The &ldquo;pretty
chapel of St. Catherine,&rdquo; noticed by Leland, has long been
forgotten.&nbsp; The celebrated well, however, of St. Julian,
under the garden wall of the hospital, is still remembered by the
inhabitants of the village; but the wonderful cures believed to
have been miraculously performed ceased with the superstition of
the times.</p>

top of a rock facing the hall, a beautiful Cenotaph has been

is guarded by three doors, the centre one being secured by a
massive wooden bar which passed through the wall of the room into
the outer wall on the opposite side of the staircase.&nbsp; The

river is in the respective parishes of Stanton Lacy and
Stokesay.&nbsp; A saw mill has been erected by Lord Craven on the
river Oney.&nbsp; In the time of Edward the Confessor, Oniberie
was in the possession of the bishop of Hereford, and after the
conquest Roger de Lacy held it of him.&nbsp; The manor and
patronage of the church was long possessed by the Burnels, and
eventually passed, in marriage, to the Lovels, in whose family it
remained till the attainder of Lord Lovel, in the time of Henry
VII.&nbsp; It was subsequently held by the Mainwarings and
Barkers, and about the year 1620 came into the hands of Lord
Craven, the ancestor of the present proprietor, by
purchase.&nbsp; There was formerly a park at Onibury, which is
now divided into farms.&nbsp; Wootton, an ancient mansion of

<h3>RICHARDS CASTLE,</h3>
<p>a parish in the lower division of the Munslow hundred,
comprises the townships of Moore and Batchcott, Overton, and
Woofferton, and is partly in this county, and partly in
Herefordshire.&nbsp; The parish contains 4,512 acres of land; and
at the census of 1801, 509 inhabitants; 1831, 586; 1841,
656.&nbsp; The village of Richards Castle is delightfully
situated about three miles from Ludlow, in the county of
Hereford.&nbsp; It was anciently called Gayton, and was a place
of considerable importance until the reign of Henry III.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Richards Castle,&rdquo; says Leland, &ldquo;standeth upon
the top of a very rocky hill, well wooded, and at the west end of
the parish then.&nbsp; The keep, the walls, and towers of it
stand, but going to ruin.&nbsp; There is a poor house of timber
in the castle garth for a farmer.&nbsp; It belongeth now to the
king; it belonged of late to the Lord Vaux; after to Pope.&nbsp;
There is a park impaled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robert de Mortimer, in the
reign of King John, had the grant of a fair and market at this
place, both of which have long been obsolete.&nbsp; The castle
was built before the conquest.&nbsp; At the doomsday survey it
was held by Osborn Fitz-Richard, whose granddaughter married
Robert de Mortimer, from whose family it passed in like manner by
an heiress to the Talbots, who possessed it till the reign of
Richard II.&nbsp; King Edward VI. granted the manor to the Bishop
of Worcester.&nbsp; In the fifteenth century T. Bradshaw obtained
it of the bishop on a long lease, and his grandson sold the lease
to Richard Salwey, Esq., in whose representatives it is now
vested.&nbsp; Some parts of the keep and walls of the castle are
still remaining, but are so embosomed in foliage as scarcely to
be discovered until they are nearly approached.&nbsp; Camden
says, &ldquo;Beneath this castle nature, which nowhere disporteth
itself more in showing wonders <a name="page544"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 544</span>than in waters, hath wrought forth a
pretty well, which is always full of little fish-bones, or, as
some think, of small frog-bones, although they be from time to
time drawn quite out of it, whence it is called Bone
Well.&rdquo;&nbsp; This curious phenomenon is still in existence,
and is the frequent resort of the curious, particularly in the
spring and autumn, when the bones are found in great
abundance.&nbsp; On the declivity of a hill near the castle, the
Royalists, amounting to nearly 2,000, were defeated by an
inferior number of Parliamentary troops, under the command of
Colonel Birch.</p>
<p>The following is a grant to the burgesses made by Lord
Mortimer, in the 29th of the reign of King
Edward:&mdash;&ldquo;Know all men present and to come, that I,
Hugh, the son of Robert Lord Mortimer, lord of Richards Castle, I
have given, granted, and by this my present writing conferred, to
all my burgesses of Richards Castle, and to all my tenants of the
townships of Moor Batchcott and Whitbrook, and to all my tenants
of the township of Overton, for their good services done to me in
the time of the Welsh war, and for twenty pounds sterling to me
in hand paid common of pasture for all manner of their cattle and
beasts in my fields at Bury Hynton, at all times after the grain
is carried thence, and in all my meadow called Shule Meadow,
after the feast of St. John the Baptist, and also common of
pasture for all their beasts in all my woods within the said
lordship of Richards Castle, as well within the county of
Hereford as within the county of Salop, at all times in the year
(except my park called Morbeck, and my Heys, lying between the
ditch called Farthings Lawnde, and one hedge called the Royard,
which are inclosed, and parted in at all times of the
year).&nbsp; I have also given and granted to my said burgesses
and tenants sufficient house-boot, hay-boot, and fire-boot, with
all other necessaries that belong to husbandries, to be yearly
taken at all times of necessaries in the said woods, by the order
and delivery of my bailiff or constable there for the time being;
to have and to hold all the aforesaid common of meadow, pasture,
and wood ground as aforesaid, to my said burgesses and tenants of
the aforesaid village of Richards Castle, Moor Batchcott,
Whitbrook, and Overton, of me and my heirs, the sum of twelve
shillings at the feast of St. Michael the Archangel, viz., the
burgesses of Richards Castle four shillings, the tenants of Moor
Batchcott and Whitbrook four shillings, and the tenants of the
township of Overton four shillings, for all manner of service,
exaction, and demand; and if it shall happen that this my grant
gains aid, withheld, or retained by me, my heirs, or by any
person claiming under us at any time for the future, then I will
and grant that all my said burgesses and tenants thereby, their
own proper wills shall take and hold the aforesaid common in all
the said meadows, pasture, and wood grounds aforegranted, and in
all places thereby strength and virtue of the said deed: and I,
the aforesaid Hugh, and my heirs, all the aforesaid common,

<h3>RUSHBURY</h3>
<p>is a considerable parish in the upper division of the Munslow
hundred, comprising the townships of Rushbury, Stone Acton,
Wall-under-Haywood, and Wilderhope and Stanway, and part of the
townships of East Wall and Getton.&nbsp; The parish comprises
upwards of 5,600 acres of land, and at the census of 1801 had 356
inhabitants; 1831, 507, and in 1841 had 109 houses and a
population of 502 souls.&nbsp; The village of Rushbury is
situated about nine miles S.W. from Much Wenlock, and the
township contained 26 houses and 115 inhabitants.&nbsp; The
principal landowners are Mrs. Lutwyche, Barnard Dickinson, Esq.,
and Mrs. Thursby; the latter is also lady of the manor.&nbsp;
Some authors conjecture this place to be the Roman station
Bravinium, between Magnum and Uriconum; the distance agreeing
better with the Roman itinerary than Bridgnorth.&nbsp; At the
Doomsday survey Roger de Lacy held of Earl Roger Riseberie, and
Odo of him, at which time there was an eyrie of hawks.&nbsp; In
the 11th of Edward I. Hugh Burnel had a charter for a market on a
Thursday, and a fair on the eve, the day, and the day after the
feast of St. Margaret the virgin, which upon a <i>quo
warranto</i> brought against Sir Philip Burnel in the 20th of
Edward I. was ratified and confirmed by the king&rsquo;s
council.&nbsp; In the time of Edward I. Richard de Harley had
free warren here.&nbsp; John de Handelo levied a fine on the
manor of Rushbury in the 14th of Edward III.&nbsp; Among the fees
of Roger Earl of March, Nicholas Burnel held one knight&rsquo;s
fee.&nbsp; In the 3rd of Edward VI. the king gave Rushbury in
exchange to Nicholas Bishop of Worcester and his successors for
lands in Warwickshire.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Church</span> is a small structure, dedicated to St. Peter,
consisting of nave and chancel, with a tower in which are five
bells.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;19. 7s. 8&frac12;d., now returned at &pound;449 in
the gift of the Bishop of Worcester.&nbsp; Incumbent, Rev.
Matthew Y. Starkey.&nbsp; The endowed school, where twelve
children are educated, and the almshouses, will be further
noticed with the various gifts to charitable uses.&nbsp; The
tithes are commuted for &pound;384.</p>
<p><a name="page546"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 546</span><span
class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Benjamin Wainwright</i>,
<i>M.D.</i>, by his will, bearing date 1st December, 1817,
directed certain trustees to raise out of his personal estate the
sum of &pound;1,200, and appropriate &pound;400 in building a
school-room and a small dwelling house for a schoolmaster, and
also two almshouses, all to be erected in the little church-yard
near the Pound, in Rushbury, if the rector would allow it.&nbsp;
And he directed that the following words should be cut upon the
stone in the front part of the dwelling house:&mdash;&ldquo;This
school and almshouse were built and endowed by Benjamin, the
seventh son of the late Richard and Mary Wainwright, of
Stanway.&rdquo;&nbsp; The residue of the said sum of &pound;1,200
he directed to be invested in the funds, and 50s. of the yearly
dividends thereof to be given to each of the poor widows resident
in the said almshouses; the trustees to provide coals for the
almshouses, and also to pay &pound;5 yearly to a schoolmaster for
teaching poor children of Rushbury, Eaton, and the adjacent
parishes every Sunday; &pound;5 to be laid out in warm clothing
on the 1st of December for the poor of Rushbury; &pound;5 per
annum to be paid to a schoolmistress for teaching children to
knit and sew, and to pay the remainder of the dividends to a
schoolmaster to instruct nine poor children of Rushbury and three
of Eaton in reading, writing, and common arithmetic.&nbsp; The
sum of &pound;400 above mentioned was reduced by the payment of
the legacy duty to &pound;360, and a school was erected at a cost
of upwards of &pound;500, part of the surplus having been
advanced by such of the trustees as were of the testator&rsquo;s
family.&nbsp; The remainder of the sum of &pound;1,200 was
invested in the purchase of stock, and there is now standing
&pound;737 new four per cent. stock, producing dividends
amounting to &pound;429. 10s. per annum, of which &pound;20 is
paid to a schoolmaster for teaching a Sunday as well as a week
day school.&nbsp; Two poor women are appointed by the trustees to
reside in the almshouses, each of whom receives &pound;2
annually, including an allowance of coals.</p>
<p>There is a parcel of land in the parish called the
Poor&rsquo;s Land, containing about six acres, and four small
tenements with gardens, and also an allotment set out in respect
of the above mentioned premises containing about an acre and
three quarters, altogether producing a rental of &pound;12 per
annum.&nbsp; The four tenements were long used for the reception
of paupers.&nbsp; A portion of the poor&rsquo;s land was given to
the rector in exchange for a part of the glebe near the
church-yard, on which the school was built.&nbsp; The sum of
&pound;2. 2s. is paid to the rector as his portion of the rent,
and the residue is chiefly expended in coals and distributed to
the poor.</p>
<p><i>Edward Lutwyche</i>, in 1601, granted a rent charge of 40s.
per annum out of his lands in Wall-under-Haywood and East Wall,
and directed six penny worth of bread to be distributed every
Sunday to six poor parishioners, each of the said poor people to
receive 2s. 4d. in money every Good Friday.&nbsp; And he directed
that every poor person appointed should receive the charity for
life.&nbsp; The yearly sum of 30s. is payable out of Day-house
farm in the township of Holt Preen, as the bequest of <i>Anne
Tipton</i>.&nbsp; The amount is distributed in bread to six poor
men and six poor women, alternately, according to the intentions
of the donor.&nbsp; <i>Martha Baker</i>, who died about fifty
years ago, is stated to have left &pound;20 to the poor of
Rushbury, the interest to be given in bread.&nbsp; This money was
applied soon after the death of the testatrix in repairing a
house on the poor&rsquo;s land used as a poor house, and in
respect thereof &pound;1 is paid annually from the poor&rsquo;s
rates, which is expended in bread for the poor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">East Wall</span> is a township and village
seven miles S.W. from Much Wenlock, partly in the parish of

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Trusty and
Well-beloved</span>, we greet you well.&nbsp; Whereas, all our
subjects of the kingdom of England and dominion of Wales, are
both by their allegiance and the act of pacification bound to
resist and suppresse such of our subjects of Scotland as have in
a hostile manner already entered, or shall hereafter enter into
this kingdome.&nbsp; And by law <a name="page548"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 548</span>your personal service, attended in a
warlike manner for the resistance of, may be required by us,
which we desire to spare, chusing rather to invite your
assistance for the maintenance of our army in a free and
voluntary expression of your affections to our service, and the
safety of this kingdom.&nbsp; And whereas the members of both
houses of parliament assembled at Oxford, have taken into their
consideration the necessity of supporting our army for the
defence of us and our people against this invasion, and for the
preservation of the religious lawes and liberties of this
kingdome, and thereupon have agreed upon the speedy raising of
the summe of one hundred thousand pounds by loane from particular
persons, towards the which themselves have advanced a very
considerable portion, and by their example hope that our well
affected subjects throughout the kingdome will in a short time
make up the remainder, whereby we shall not only be enabled to
pay and recruite our army, but likewise be enabled to put our
armies in such a condition as our subjects shall not suffer by
free quarter or the unruliness of our soldiers, which is now in
present agitation, and will (we doubt not, by the advice of the
members of both houses assembled) be spedily effected.&nbsp; We
doe towards so good a work, by the approbation and advice of the
members of both houses assembled, desire you forthwith to lend us
the sum of thirty pounds, or the value thereof in plate, toucht
plate at five shillings, and untoucht plate at four shillings per
ounce, and to pay or deliver the same within seven daies after
the receipt thereof to the hands of our high sheriffe of that our
own county, or to such whome he shall appoint to receive the
same, upon his acquittances for the receipt thereof to the hands
of our high sherriffe of that our county, who is forthwith to
returne and pay the same at Corpus Cristi Colledge in Oxford, to
the hands of the Earle of Bath, the Lord Seymour, Mr. John
Ashburnham, and Mr. John Fettiplace, or any of them who appointed
treasurers for the receiving and issuing thereof by the said
members, (by whose order only the said money is to be disposed),
and to give receipts for the same, the which we promise to repay
as soon as God shall enable us.&nbsp; This sum to be advanced
with speed.&nbsp; We are necessitated to apply ourselves to such
persons as yourself, of whose ability and affection we have
confidence, giving you this assurance&mdash;that in such further
charges that the necessity of our just defence shall inforce us
to require of our good subjects, your forwardnesse and
disbursements shall be considered to your best advantage.&nbsp;
And so presuming you will not fail to expresse your affection
herein, we bid you farewell.&nbsp; Given at our court at Oxford,

<h3>STANTON LACY</h3>
<p>is a considerable parish in the lower division of the Munslow
hundred, comprising the townships of Downton, Hayton Lower,
Hayton Upper, part of Henley, part of Hopton, Rock, Stanton Lacy,
and Wooton, and the hamlets of East and West.&nbsp; In 1801 there
were 905 inhabitants; 1831, 1,467; 1841, 1,540.&nbsp; Acres,
7,765; rateable value, &pound;11,008. 5s.&nbsp; The township of
Stanton Lacy has 2,393 acres of land; at the census of 1841 it
contained 141 houses and 724 inhabitants, of which 146 persons
are returned as in the Ludlow Union Workhouse.&nbsp; The village
is pleasantly situated three and a half miles N.N.W. from Ludlow,
near the eastern bank of the Corve.&nbsp; The Earl of Craven is
the principal landowner and lord of the manor.&nbsp; In the 20th
of Edward I., a <i>quo warranto</i> was brought against the Prior
of Lantone Prune, in Wales, for claiming pleas of the crown and
wayffe, and for holding a fair and a market in the manor of
Stanton Lacy, and in Rokele.&nbsp; The Prior pleads that he is
not lord of the manor, but is only patron of the church, and
holds Rokele that lies in the parish.&nbsp; Hugh de Lowther <a
name="page549"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 549</span>replies
that the bishop cannot prove any of his predecessors to have come
in with the Conqueror, and to have acquired those privileges by
conquest, because being men in holy orders they come to their
freeholds by the grants of others, and therefore he ought to
produce some special grant from the crown to support his
claim.&nbsp; This place was part of the royal demesnes when the
house of York recovered their right to the crown.&nbsp; In the
time of Henry VIII., Sir William Thomas, Knt., held the manor of
Stanton Lacy and a pasture known by the name of Stanton Fryth,
for the term of twenty-one years, at the rent of &pound;7.
10s.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a fine old
structure, some portions of which are unquestionably of great
antiquity; it has recently been beautified, and the interior has
undergone a complete renovation at a cost of about
&pound;1000.&nbsp; The chancel is very beautiful; the altar
exhibits some very elaborate workmanship, and the floor is
covered with tesselated pavement.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage,
rated in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;16, now returned at
&pound;518, in the patronage of the Earl of Craven; incumbent,
Rev. Joseph Bowles, D.D.&nbsp; There is a national school in the

inhabitants.&nbsp; The Earl of Craven is the landowner and lord
of the manor.&nbsp; In this township is the hamlet of <span
class="smcap">Hayton&rsquo;s Bent</span>, where the Wesleyans and
Primitive Methodists have each a small chapel.&nbsp; A small
rivulet which flows from the hilly ground in this township
becomes on its passage through rocks strongly impregnated with
carbonate of lime, and is found to possess the property of
forming petrifactions of such articles as are placed in it.&nbsp;
The township of <i>Henley</i>, partly in this parish and partly
in that of Bitterley, is noticed in the latter parish.&nbsp; The
township of <i>Hopton</i> also partly in this parish, is noticed

<h3>STOKE ST. MILBOROUGH</h3>
<p>is a parish in the lower division of the Munslow hundred,
comprising 4,400 acres of land, and is divided for highway
purposes into the townships of Clee Downton, Clee Stanton, and
Stoke, and the chapelry of Heath.&nbsp; At the census of 1841
there were 110 houses and 553 inhabitants exclusive of the
chapelry of Heath, which contained ten houses and a population of
sixty-three souls.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;4,454. 8s.&nbsp;
The village of Stoke is delightfully situated in a romantic
district, near the <a name="page551"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
551</span>southern side of the Brown Clee Hill, six miles and a
half N.N.E. from Ludlow.&nbsp; From the summit of the Brown Clee
Hill, which is chiefly situated in this parish, a most beautiful
panoramic view is seen of the country, which for extent and
diversity is not surpassed in England.&nbsp; To the north and
south are seen the fruitful plains of Shropshire, pleasingly
varied with woody hills, and lovely vales dotted with the humble
cottage of the labourer and the mansion of the opulent, whilst
the Cambrian hills, which rear their lofty heights in wild
grandeur towards the west, give an additional charm to the
enchanting scene.&nbsp; According to the description given of the
manor of Stoke St. Milborough at the Doomsday survey, it would
seem then to have consisted of seven hides of land, and a large
wood.&nbsp; Earl Roger gave it to the chaplains of the church of
St. Milborough.&nbsp; The principal landowners are the Hon.
Sidney Herbert; Dr. Cavendish Wall; E. H. Owen, Esq.; and Mr.
John Patrick; there are also several other proprietors.&nbsp; The
Hon. Sidney Herbert, lord of the manor, regularly pays a fee farm
rent of &pound;29. 10s. 3d. to the Duke of Cleveland, as the
representative of the grantee of it from the crown; and the Hon.
S. Herbert collects from various freeholders of the manor several
rents amounting in the aggregate to the said sum.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span> is a venerable structure,
dedicated to the saint from whom the name of the parish is
derived.&nbsp; The interior is commodious, and contains an
antique font, and several ancient monuments to the Lee
family.&nbsp; It has a handsome tower and four bells.&nbsp; The
living is a vicarage, with the curacy of Heath annexed, returned
at &pound;474, in the patronage and incumbency of the Rev. George
Morgan, M.A.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Vicarage</span> is a

School</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the afternoon of Monday, July 25,
1768, there happened an extraordinary gust of wind, a few miles
to the north-west of Cleobury, in Shropshire.&nbsp; Its effects
were most remarkable in the parish of Stoke St. Milborough, where
it unroofed the dwelling house, barns, stables, and every other
building belonging to a farmer of the name of Bishop; one of
which buildings was entirely levelled with the ground.&nbsp; In
his orchard it destroyed upwards of sixty apple and pear trees,
which were either broken off in the butt, or forced up by the
roots.&nbsp; Several large elms and poplar trees were likewise
blown down.&nbsp; He computed the damage he had sustained at
&pound;300.&nbsp; His son, a youth sixteen years of age, being in
the fold, was lifted four or five yards above the surface of the
ground, and carried to the distance of eighty yards, part of the
space being over a fish-pond, a hedge, and a stone wall; but at
last, falling gradually in a field of hay, he received but little
hurt.&rdquo;&nbsp; A donation of &pound;400 has been invested by
the present incumbent in the three per cent. consols, in the
names of certain trustees, the dividends of which are laid out in
bread, and distributed among such poor as are most regular in
their attendance at church.</p>

<h3>STOKESAY</h3>
<p>is a parish and village in the lower division of the Munslow
hundred, containing 3,609 acres of land, and comprising the
townships of Aldon, Stoke and Newton, Wettleton, and parts of
Broom and Rowton; the latter however is chiefly in the Hopesay
parish, where it will be found noticed.&nbsp; At the census of
1801, there were 512 inhabitants: 1831, 529: 1841, 556; at the
latter period there were 108 inhabited houses.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;3,939 15s.&nbsp; The township of Stoke and Newton
contains 1,222 acres of land, and in 1841 had 38 houses and 188
inhabitants.&nbsp; The Craven Arms is a handsome and commodious
hotel, not surpassed by any in the county: in the front of which
is a conical column, on which is inscribed the distance of this
place from all the principal towns in England, Scotland, and
Wales.&nbsp; At the Doomsday survey, Roger de Lacy held Stoches
of the King, at which period there were eight plough lands,
twenty villains, belonging to the manor, and a mill.&nbsp; The
Lacy family continued in possession of it till the year 1207,
when it was carried by an heiress to John de Vernon.&nbsp; Soon
after 1240 the manor was sold to William de Ludlowe, whose son
Lawrence de Ludlowe lived at the castle.&nbsp; In 1497 it passed
to Thomas Vernon, and afterwards to Sir George Mainwaring, and he
sold it about the year 1620 to Lord Craven, whose representative
the Earl of Craven is the principal landowner and lord of the
manor.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Stoke Castle</span>, formerly
the seat of the Baldwin family, is a curious specimen of the
castellated mansion of former days.&nbsp; A gate house
constructed of wooden framework, with curious carvings, leads to
a quadrangular court, on one side of which are the remains of the
rampart, and on the other sides the house, offices, and
tower.&nbsp; The hall and tower is opposite the gate house, in
the latter is a winding staircase.&nbsp; The hall is very
spacious, but there is no vestige of a fire-place, the ancient
mode of warming apartments of this description being by a
reredoss, or brazier, filled with burning charcoal, and placed in
the centre; at one end is the gallery for the minstrelsy on days
of festivity; the wainscot is of oak, and the chimney piece is
elaborately carved.&nbsp; The tower which is lofty and in the
form of an irregular polygon, rises from the south-west corner of
the court, and is crowned with an embattled parapet; the ground
floor is a gloomy apartment lighted by four small pointed
windows, and the upper stories are divided into very small
rooms.&nbsp; This stately mansion has suffered a degradation not
uncommon to places of ancient note, part of it having been used
as an out-house to an adjoining farm, and the rest suffered to
fall to decay.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a venerable structure
situated near the castle, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and
consists of nave and chancel, with a tower in which are six
bells.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, valued in the king&rsquo;s

incumbent, Rev. William Williams.&nbsp; The Parochial school was
formerly held in the church belfry, it is now taught in a private
house, but a new school is expected shortly to be built.&nbsp;
<i>Roger Powell</i> who died in 1616, left to this parish
&pound;10. a year, and directed one shilling a week to be
distributed to the poor, and the residue towards the maintenance
of a schoolmaster.&nbsp; Of this annuity, which is paid out of a
farm in Church Stoke and Lydham, &pound;2. 12s; is given away
with the sacrament money on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, and the
remainder is paid to the schoolmaster.&nbsp; <i>Mary Pearce</i>,
in 1769, bequeathed &pound;5 to the poor of this parish, <a
name="page553"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 553</span>and it was
then agreed that the said sum should be laid out in the purchase
of a bier cloth, the cost of which was &pound;4. 5s. 7&frac12;d.,
and the rest in books for the poor children of the parish; it was
further agreed that in lieu of the interest of the said &pound;5,
a bible should be given yearly on Easter Monday to such poor
child as the parishioners should appoint.</p>

<h3>TUGFORD</h3>
<p>is a parish in the upper division of the Munslow hundred, nine
miles N.N.E. from Ludlow, which contains 1,990 acres of land, the
rateable value of which is &pound;1,609. 5s.&nbsp; The soil is
well adapted for the growth of turnips and barley.&nbsp;
Population in 1801, 165; 1831, 188; 1841, 145; at the latter
period there were 31 houses.&nbsp; The village of Tugford is on a
good road leading to Ludlow, the situation is low, but dry,
pleasant, and warm, being sheltered from the east by a tall
plantation rising at the back of it.&nbsp; A small stream called
Tugford Brook turns a corn mill in the village, and shortly after
has its confluence with the river Corfe.&nbsp; In the time of
Henry III. the abbot and convent of Shrewsbury held the ville of
Tugford, which was computed to consist of two hides and a half of
land.&nbsp; At the assizes, in the 20th of Edward I., the abbot
of Salop claimed the liberty of free warren here, of which his
successors had a confirmation in the time of Richard II.&nbsp;
The principal landowners are the Earl of Craven and C. O. Childe
Pemberton, Esq.&nbsp; The parish church, dedicated to St.
Catherine, is a small but handsome structure, probably erected
about the middle of the 16th century.&nbsp; The living is a
rectory annexed to that of Holdgate, in the patronage of the
Bishop of Hereford.&nbsp; Incumbent, Rev. Joseph Corbett.&nbsp;
The rectory house is a good residence adjoining the
church-yard.&nbsp; <i>Thomas Clinton</i>, in 1815, gave
&pound;100, the interest to be given among ten poor widows of
this parish.&nbsp; In 1652, <i>Robert Ellis</i> bequeathed 10s.
each to the several parishes of Tugford, Abdow, Holdgate,
Tregnon, and Llanwithilaw.&nbsp; The tithes were commuted in

<h2><a name="page554"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 554</span>THE
WENLOCK FRANCHISE.</h2>
<p>The Wenlock Franchise is bounded on the east by the Brimstree
Hundred, on the south by the Stottesden Hundred, on the west by
the Condover and Munslow Hundreds, and on the north by that of
South Bradford.&nbsp; The borough and franchise of Wenlock were
formerly co-extensive with the Hundred of Patintern, mentioned in
Doomsday Book, which comprised the following parishes,
viz.:&mdash;Much Wenlock, Little Wenlock, Broseley, Madeley,
Benthall, Barrow, Tinley, Badger, Beckbury, Priors Ditton, Stoke
St. Milborough, Eaton-under-Heywood, Hughley, Shipton, Monk
Hopton, Willey, Deuxhill, and the Extra Parochial Liberty of
Posenhall.&nbsp; By an order of quarter sessions, held at
Shrewsbury, April 4th, 1836, the parishes of Badger, Deuxhill,
and Beckbury, were added to the Brimstree Hundred; and the
parishes of Eaton, Shipton, and Stoke St. Milborough, should
thenceforward be considered as part of the Munslow Hundred.&nbsp;
Ironstone, coal, limestone, and a superior clay, are found in
this division of the county, which is celebrated for extensive
iron-works, the manufacture of porcelain earthenware, tobacco
pipes, bricks, tiles, and draining pipes.&nbsp; The manufacturing
district is chiefly confined to the north and north-east verge of
the franchise.&nbsp; It is intersected by the river Severn at the
northern extremity, and the river afterwards forms the boundary
of the franchise for some distance.&nbsp; At the census of 1841
this division of the county contained 3,703 inhabited houses, 155
uninhabited, and 29 building; and a population of 18,016 souls;
of whom 8,936 were males and 9,080 females.&nbsp; Of the total
population 16,518 persons were born in the county, and 1,498
elsewhere.</p>
<h3>BARROW</h3>
<p>is a small but pleasantly situated village and parish, in the
Wenlock Franchise, two miles east from Much Wenlock, and two

39<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, the rateable value of
which is &pound;3,086. 6s. 1d.&nbsp; At the census in 1801 there
were 479 inhabitants; 1831, 351; and in 1841 there were 85 houses
and a population of 383 souls.&nbsp; Lord Forester and Sir
Richard Acton, Bart., are the landowners.&nbsp; <span

basin.&nbsp; On the south side of the church-yard is buried Tom
Moody, the celebrated whipper-in to George Forester, Esq.&nbsp;
The grave-stone is simply inscribed &ldquo;Tom Moody, died 19th
November, 1796.&rdquo;&nbsp; The church was formerly an appendage
to the Priory of Wenlock.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy
annexed to the rectory of Willey.&nbsp; The Rev. Henry Bridgeman
is the incumbent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The School and
Almshouse</span>.&mdash;<i>John Slaney</i>, merchant tailor of
London, having, in his life-time, built in the parish of Barrow
an almshouse for six poor aged men or women that had been ancient
dwellers thereabout, and appointed six acres of ground to be laid
out for their better relief and to the support of a school.&nbsp;
He also directed an allowance of 1s. 4d. weekly to be made to
each inmate, and every alternate year a good frieze gown to be
given to each person, worth 13s. 4d., and hose and shoes to the
value of 6s. 8d.&nbsp; Mr. Slaney also erected a school for the
free teaching of twenty children, and ordained that a great part
of the six acres of land above mentioned should be for the
maintenance of the school; and he gave towards the maintenance of
the schoolmaster &pound;10 a-year for ever.&nbsp; For the
performance of the said allowance he gave a rent charge of
&pound;30 per annum issuing out of his manor of Willey.&nbsp; And
for the residue of his gift to make up the pensions of the said
schoolhouse and almshouse, he charged his cousin, John Slaney,
that he and his heirs and assignees should for ever pay the same
as a rent <a name="page555"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
555</span>charge out of his lands called the Hem, which lands he
gave to his said cousin on his continuing the charities according
to the conditions of his will.&nbsp; In this will Mr. Slaney is
directed to keep the school and almshouse in continual repair,
and to provide fuel.&nbsp; The premises thus conditionally
devised became the property of John Stephens, Esq., who, in 1816,
exchanged the lands with Cecil Weld Forester, Esq., lord of the
manor of Willey, for lands situated near Barrow church.&nbsp; The
almshouse having become much dilapidated, the said Cecil W.
Forester, Esq., agreed to be at the expense of taking down and
rebuilding the school and almshouse (at his own expense), and
keeping the same in repair during the term of his natural life,
and to find garments and coals, pursuant to the will of the
founder.&nbsp; In pursuance of this arrangement, the almshouse
was taken down, and a new one and a schoolhouse built on the
lands which he had given in exchange.&nbsp; The yearly
expenditure when the Charity Commissioners published their report
was &pound;33. 16s., of which the rent charge on the manor of
Willey provides for &pound;30; so that there remained for the
annual charge upon the lands of Mr. Stephens &pound;3. 16s., but
which was then paid by Mr. Forester, besides the cost of twelve
tons of coals.&nbsp; With respect to the terms of this exchange,
it cannot escape observation that the &pound;3. 16s. and the
twelve tons of coals which are furnished by Mr. Forester, in
pursuance of his agreement, and the expense that he may be at in
repairs, are a part of the consideration that he was to give for
the old schoolhouse and almshouse, and the land belonging to
them; and not the annual supply which Mr. Stephens&rsquo;s
estates were charged by the will of Mr. Slaney to furnish.&nbsp;
When the charity has received Mr. Forester&rsquo;s supply, it has
received nothing more than the stipulated equivalent for the old
schoolhouse and almshouse premises.&nbsp; But before the exchange
it was entitled to something more, namely, to the supply charged
on Mr. Stephens&rsquo;s estates.&nbsp; It must, therefore,
continue still entitled to that supply since the exchange; unless
the effect of the exchange has been to exonerate the estates of
Mr. Stephens during the life of Mr. Forester at the expense of
the charity.&nbsp; We think that such has not been the effect,
but that Mr. Stephens&rsquo;s estates are liable to make good to
the charity the annual supply of &pound;3. 16s. and twelve tons
of coals yearly, and to continue that supply in future.&nbsp; The
school teacher, in addition to the &pound;10 prescribed by the
will of Mr. Slaney, has the use of a schoolhouse, and about five
acres of land attached to it, with the privilege of taking
private scholars.</p>
<p>It appears from the parish books, that a sum of &pound;9
poors&rsquo; stock, which had for many years been in the hands of
successive parish officers, was applied in the year 1788 to the
repairs of the church, as interest of which the sum of 10s. is
distributed by the churchwardens at Christmas in fourpenny loaves
among the poor of the parish.</p>

fit.&nbsp; The dividends are received under the power of
attorney, and are paid to the minister, who regularly distributes
them about Christmas in small sums among the poor.</p>
<p><i>Edward Brown</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, of Broseley, bequeathed

<h3>BROSELEY,</h3>
<p>anciently written <span class="smcap">Burwardsley</span>, is a
parish and considerable market town in the Wenlock franchise,
four miles east from Much Wenlock, 13 miles south-east from
Shrewsbury, and 146 miles north-west from London.&nbsp; The town
is seated on an eminence above the Severn, and consists
principally of one long irregular built street, with minor
streets branching off in different directions.&nbsp; The houses
are mostly of brick, some of them of respectable appearance,
interspersed with others of a more humble description, inhabited
chiefly by miners and the operatives employed in the brick and
iron works.&nbsp; It stands in the middle of an extensive mining
district, in which coal and ironstone are obtained; and there is
an extensive iron foundry here, with others in the immediate
vicinity.&nbsp; The town and neighbourhood are also famous for
the manufacture of fire bricks and tobacco pipes, which are
exported to all parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; Broseley is the only
place in England where the celebrated glazed tobacco pipes are
manufactured, and it is supposed this was the first place where
the manufacture of this article commenced; upwards of two
centuries ago they were made from clay procured in this locality,
now the clay got here is used for the manufacture of bricks,
tiles and earthenware, and the pipeclay is procured from
Devonshire and Cornwall.&nbsp; Messrs. William Southron and Co.
<a name="page557"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 557</span>have an
extensive establishment for the manufacture of the glazed pipes,
employing upwards of forty operatives, and using forty tons of
the Devonshire pipeclay annually.&nbsp; The bricks and tiles made
at Broseley are not surpassed by any in the kingdom; there are
several extensive establishments conducted by the Messrs. Davies
and others.&nbsp; The parish contains 1,970<span

are Lord Forester: Francis Harrison, Esq.; John Onions, Esq.;
John Davenport, Esq.; and William Taylor, Esq.&nbsp; There are
also a number of other freeholders.&nbsp; At the census in 1801,
this parish had a population of 4,832 souls; 1831, 4,299; 1841,
4,829, and in 1851 there were 4,738 inhabitants, of whom 2,229
were males, and 2,509 females: at the latter period there were
1,005 inhabited houses, 43 uninhabited, and two building;
rateable value of the parish, &pound;7,891. 8s. 6d.&nbsp; The
market held on a Wednesday is not very numerously attended.&nbsp;
Fairs are held on the last Tuesday in April, and October
28th.&nbsp; The Market Hall is a brick structure, situated in
High street, built about the year 1779.&nbsp; The Court Room,
over the market hall, contains a fine oak chair beautifully
carved, and dated 1626; in this room the petty sessions are held
every six weeks.&nbsp; Here also was formerly held the court of
requests, which had jurisdiction in eight of the neighbouring
parishes; this, however, has been superseded by the new County
Court Act.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to All
Saints, is a free-stone structure, consisting of nave, chancel
and side aisles, with a square tower in which are six bells; the
nave is separated from the side aisles by five pointed arches on
each side; over the side aisles and at the west end are
galleries; upon the latter is placed an organ.&nbsp; The church
was rebuilt in 1845, and in consequence of a grant of &pound;400
from the Incorporated Society, 694 of the sittings are free and
unappropriated for ever; there is now accommodation for 1,200
hearers; it is neatly fitted up with oak sittings, and the roof
is of groined timber.&nbsp; The old church was a brick structure,
with a low tower of free stone, and had sittings for 782
persons.&nbsp; The living is a rectory, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;7. 18s. 6d., in the patronage of Lord
Forester: incumbent, the Hon. and Rev. Orlando Watkin Weld
Forester, M.A.; curate, Rev. Andrew Burn, B.A.&nbsp; The tithes
are commuted for &pound;453.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Baptists</span> have small chapels in Duke street and on
Harris&rsquo;s Green.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The

<span class="smcap">The National School</span> is held in a
spacious room over the Market Hall, which measures sixty-one feet
long and twenty-one feet broad.&nbsp; The average attendance of
scholars at the present time is one hundred and ninety-five.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jackfield</span> is a populous hamlet, in
the parish of Broseley, stretching along the banks of the Severn,
and situated near a mile north of the parish church.&nbsp; Here
the inhabitants are busily engaged in extensive works for the
manufacture of bricks and tiles.&nbsp; At this place is also
situated the <span class="smcap">Ivanhoe Pottery</span>, an
establishment conducted by Mr. George Proudman, where all kinds
of earthenware are manufactured.&nbsp; The clay used in the
manufacture is got from mines on the premises, and is found in
regular layers above the coal and limestone; some of the mines
extend to the depth of one hundred yards.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span> (or Chapel of Ease) at Jackfield
is a handsome brick structure, with stone finishings, consisting
of nave and chancel, with a square tower.&nbsp; It is situated on
an eminence overlooking Ironbridge and a part of Coalbrook
Dale.&nbsp; It is dedicated to St. Mary, and was built in 1759,
by Francis Turner Blythe, Esq.&nbsp; The interior has a neat
appearance, and on the south side there is a neat marble tablet
to the memory of Alexander Brodie, Esq., ironmaster, of Calcutt,
who died June 5th, 1830.&nbsp; Another neat tablet remembers the
founder of the church, Francis T. Blythe, Esq., who died
September 22nd, 1770, aged 61 years.&nbsp; There is also a tablet
to Thomas Carter Phillips, Esq., who died in 1783.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The National School</span> is a commodious brick
structure, erected in the year 1844.&nbsp; The school-room is
used as a place of worship on Sunday and Wednesday
evenings.&nbsp; The rector and curate of Broseley officiate
alternately.</p>
<p><a name="page558"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 558</span>Not
far from Jackfield formerly stood the ancient mansion of the
Tuckies.&nbsp; About sixty years ago this house was repaired for
Lord Dundonald, father of Lord Cochrane, who resided here a
considerable time, making chemical experiments, among the
principal of which was that of extracting tar from coals.&nbsp;
For this purpose many kilns or ovens were erected on the banks of
the Severn, and the process was conducted in the following
manner:&mdash;&ldquo;A range of stoves was supplied with coal
kept burning at the bottom; the smoke was conveyed by horizontal
tunnels into a capacious funnel built of brick, supported by
arches, and covered on the top by a shallow pond of water.&nbsp;
The smoke, condensed by the chill of the water, fell on the
bottom of the funnel in the form of tar, and was conveyed by
pipes into a receiver, whence it was pumped into a large boiler,
and boiled to a proper consistence, or otherwise inspissated into
pitch; the volatile parts which arose during this inspissation
were again condensed into oil used for varnish.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Great quantities of this useful article were sent for the use of
the navy, and much of it was used in japanning.&nbsp; Lord
Dundonald expended large sums of money in these undertakings,
which were unsuccessful as to profitable remuneration.&nbsp; On
the site of these operations was afterwards erected the great
iron foundry where so many cannon were cast by Mr. Brodie during
the late war.</p>
<p>A most melancholy accident occurred near Broseley on October
23rd, 1799.&nbsp; The passage boat in crossing the Severn, which
at this place is very rapid, was overturned.&nbsp; There were
forty-one persons in the boat who were employed in the china
works of Messrs. Rose and Co., of these thirteen only escaped,
the remaining twenty-eight were all drowned.&nbsp; Tradition
states that a large house in Broseley was formerly in possession
of some Dutchmen, who had a mint for coining money secreted in
cellars under the house.&nbsp; They lived in a very expensive
style, and kept race horses.&nbsp; There is a curious fossil
found here in the stratum of coal resembling a fish with the head
and tail cut off.&nbsp; It is covered with scales, and measures
about eight inches long.&nbsp; Its solidity is much greater than
the substance in which it is infolded, and when broken appears
like limestone; if thrown into the fire it explodes with
considerable violence.</p>
<p>In the year 1711 a very remarkable inflammable spring was
discovered at Broseley, of which the Rev. Mr. Mason, professor at
Cambridge, gives the following account:&mdash;&ldquo;The well for
four or five feet deep is six or seven feet wide, within that is
another hole of like depth, dug in clay; in the bottom whereof is
placed a cylindric earthern vessel, of about four or five inches
diameter at the mouth, having the bottom taken off, and the sides
well fixed in, the clay rammed close about it.&nbsp; Within the
pot is a brown water as thick as puddle continually forced up
with a violent motion, beyond that of boiling water, and a
rumbling hollow noise rising and falling by fits; but there was
no appearance of any vapour arising, which perhaps might have
been visible had not the sun shone so bright.&nbsp; Upon putting
the candle down at the end of a stick, at a quarter of a yard
distance, it took fire, darting and flashing after a very violent
manner, for about half a yard high, much in the manner of spirits
in a lamp, but with great agitation.&nbsp; It was said that a tea
kettle had been made to boil in about nine minutes time, and that
it had been left burning for forty-eight hours without any
sensible diminution.&nbsp; It was extinguished by putting a wet
mop upon it, which it was necessary to keep there for a
considerable time, otherwise it would not go out.&nbsp; Upon the
removal of the mop there arises a sulphurous smoke, lasting about
a minute, and yet the water is cold to the touch.&nbsp; The cause
of this inflammable property is most probably the mixture of the
waters with petroleum, which is one of the most inflammable
substances in nature, and has the property of burning on the
surface of water.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the year 1755 this well
entirely disappeared by the sinking of a coal pit in its
neighbourhood.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>John
Barrett</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, of the Madeiras, bequeathed the sum of
&pound;200 to the poor of Broseley.&nbsp; <i>Frances Morgan</i>
left &pound;50, the interest to be divided among twelve poor
widows on Christmas-day annually.&nbsp; <i>Richard Edwards</i>,
of Rowton, left &pound;110 to be <a name="page559"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 559</span>laid out in land, and the profits
thereof to be distributed on Christmas-day and Easter-day, in
equal proportions, among such poor widows of the parish as his
heirs and the minister of the parish should judge proper objects
of charity.&nbsp; <i>Esther Hollyman</i> left &pound;20 to be
added to the poor&rsquo;s stock in 1730.&nbsp; It appears from
entries in a modern parish book and from a memorandum in the
handwriting of a late curate of the parish, that the several
legacies above specified, amounting together to the sum of
&pound;380, were lent to the parish about the year 1777, and
employed (with other monies borrowed and raised by subscriptions)
in building a market house and shops, from the rents of which it
was agreed that a sum not exceeding &pound;18 should be annually
distributed among the poor.&nbsp; By a more recent resolution,
which purports to have been made at a parish meeting held on the
31st May, 1802, it was resolved&mdash;&ldquo;That there should be
paid to the poor, from the revenues of the market hall, in half
yearly payments, the annual sum of &pound;18 until the &pound;3
above &pound;15 should liquidate a debt which appeared due to the
said poor of &pound;43; and that then &pound;15 per annum should
be paid only as the permanent interest of &pound;380 borrowed of
the trustees of the said poor, and for the purpose of building
the said market hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; How the debt of &pound;43
originated we are not able to state, the old parish books, which
would probably have thrown some light upon the subject, having
been lost.&nbsp; It appears to us, however, not improbable that
this sum may be the remains of the poor&rsquo;s stock arising
from the benefactions which are recorded on the tables in the
church, left by ten several donors, and amounting to &pound;51.
10s.&nbsp; If the debt of &pound;43, stated to be due from the
parish to the poor, was part of the stock arising from the above
benefactions, the resolution by which it was determined to
distribute it by instalments among the poor seems to be at
variance with the intentions of the respective donors, whose
object clearly was the establishment of a fund that should
continue permanently productive.&nbsp; It may be necessary to
observe that although by the payment of &pound;3 per annum,
according to the terms of the resolution above mentioned, the
debt of &pound;43 would be wholly liquidated in the year 1816,
yet the annual payment of &pound;18 has been since continued
without any abatement.&nbsp; This sum is distributed by the
minister in equal moieties at Christmas and Easter, among the
poor inhabitants of Broseley, in sums proportioned to their
necessities.</p>
<p><i>William Lewis</i>, by indenture, dated January 2nd, 1740,
granted a yearly rent charge of 20s., issuing out of a messuage
and two acres of land, situate near the church, in Broseley, with
the penalty of 6s. for every day that the payment should be in
arrear, and directed the same to be distributed among twenty poor
widows.&nbsp; It further appears from the benefaction table that
<i>Andrew Langley</i>, of the Woodhouse, left 12s. yearly to be
distributed by the minister and churchwardens on St.
Andrew&rsquo;s-day yearly, and to be paid for ever by the owner
of the Woodhouse estate.</p>
<p><i>Mary Cotton</i>, who died in 1838, bequeathed to the
minister and churchwardens for the time being of this parish the
sum of &pound;300, three per cent consolidated bank annuities,
upon trust, to receive the interest and divide it among forty
poor widows of this parish on the 29th of December, yearly.&nbsp;
<i>Fanny Pritchard</i> left &pound;100 in trust to the same
parties, to be invested in government securities, and directed
the interest to be divided among ten poor widows on St.
Thomas&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>At a place called the Birches, between Buildwas and
Ironbridge, and not far from Broseley, an extraordinary
phenomenon occurred in May, 1775, of which the following account
has been given by the Rev. John Fletcher, of Madeley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I went to the spot,&rdquo; says Mr. Fletcher,
&ldquo;the first thing that struck me was the destruction of the
little bridge that separated the parish of Madeley from that of
Buildwas, and the total disappearing of the turnpike road to
Buildwas bridge, instead of which nothing presented itself to my
view but a confused heap of bushes, and huge clods of earth
tumbled one over another.&nbsp; The river also wore a different
aspect; it was shallow, turbid, noisy, boisterous, and came down
from a different point.&nbsp; Whether I considered the water or
the land the scene appeared to me entirely new, and as I could
not fancy myself in another part of the country, I concluded <a
name="page560"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 560</span>that the
God of nature had shaken his providential iron rod over the
subverted spot before me.&nbsp; Following the track made by a
great number of spectators, who came already from the
neighbouring parishes, I climbed over the ruins and came to a
field well grown with rye-grass, where the ground was greatly
cracked in several places, and where large turfs, some entirely,
others half turned up exhibited the appearance of straight or
crooked furrows, imperfectly formed by a plough drawn at a
venture.&nbsp; Getting from that field over the hedge, into a
part of the road which was yet visible, I found it raised in one
place, sunk in another, concave in a third, hanging on one side
in a fourth, and contracted as if some uncommon force had pressed
the two hedges together.&nbsp; But the higher part of it
surprised me most, and brought directly to my remembrance those
places of mount Vesuvius where the solid stony lava has been
strongly worked by repeated earthquakes, for the hard beaten
gravel that formed the surface of the road was broken every way
into huge masses, partly detached from each other, with deep
apertures between them exactly like the shattered lava.&nbsp;
This striking likeness of circumstances made me conclude that the
similar effect might proceed from the same cause, namely, a
strong convulsion on the surface if not in the bowels of the
earth.&nbsp; Going a little farther towards Buildwas I found that
the road was again totally lost for a considerable space, having
been overturned, absorbed, or tumbled with the hedges that
bounded it to a considerable distance towards the river; this
part of the desolation appeared then to me inexpressibly
dreadful.&nbsp; Between a shattered field and the river there was
that morning a bank on which besides a great deal of underwood
grew twenty fine large oaks, this wood shot with such violence
into the Severn before it that it forced the water in great
columns a considerable height like mighty fountains, and gave the
overflowing river a retrograde motion.&nbsp; This is not the only
accident that happened to the Severn; for near the Grove, the
channel which was chiefly of a soft blue rock burst in ten
thousand pieces, and rose perpendicularly about ten yards,
heaving up the immense quantity of water and the shoals of fishes
that were therein.&nbsp; Among the rubbish at the bottom of the
river, which was very deep in that place, there were one or two
huge stones and a large piece of timber, or an oak tree, which
from time immemorial had lain partly buried in the mud I suppose
in consequence of some flood; the stones and tree were thrown up
as if they had been only a pebble and a stick, and are now at
some distance from the river, many feet higher than the surface
of it.&nbsp; Ascending from the ruins of the road I came to those
of a barn, which after travelling many yards towards the river
had been absorbed in a chasm where the shattered roof was yet
visible.&nbsp; Next to those remains of the barn, and partly
parallel with the river, was a long edge which had been torn from
a part of it yet adjoining to the garden hedge, and had been
removed above forty yards downward together with some large trees
that were in it and the land that it enclosed.&nbsp; The tossing,
tearing, and shifting of so many acres of land below, was
attended with the formation of stupendous chasms above.&nbsp; At
some distance above, near the wood which crowns the desolated
spot, another chasm, or rather a complication of chasms excited
my admiration; it is an assemblage of chasms, one of which that
seems to terminate the desolation to the north-east, runs some
hundred yards towards the river and Madeley wood; it looked like
the deep channel of some great serpentine river dried up, whose
little islands, fords, and hollows appear without a watery
veil.&nbsp; This long chasm at the top seems to be made up of two
or three that run into each other, and their conjunction when it
is viewed from a particular point exhibits the appearance of a
ruined fortress whose ramparts have been blown up by mines that
have done dreadful execution, and yet have spared here and there
a pyramid of earth, or a shattered tower by which the spectators
can judge of the nature and solidity of the demolished
bulwark.&nbsp; Fortunately there was on the devoted spot but one
house, inhabited by two poor countrymen and their families; it
stands yet, though it has removed about a yard from its former
situation.&nbsp; The morning in which the desolation happened,
Samuel Wilcocks, one of those countrymen, got up about four
o&rsquo;clock, and opening the window to see if the weather was
fair he took notice of a small crack in the earth about four or
five inches wide, and observed <a name="page561"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 561</span>the above mentioned field of corn
heaving up and rolling about like the waves of the sea; the trees
by the motion of the ground waved also, as if they had been blown
with the wind, though the air was calm and serene; the river
Severn, which for some days had overflowed its banks, was also
very much agitated and seemed to turn back to its source.&nbsp;
The man being astonished at such a sight, rubbed his eyes,
supposing himself not quite awake, and being soon convinced that
destruction stalked about, he alarmed his wife, and taking
children in their arms they went out of the house as fast as they
could, accompanied by the other man and his wife.&nbsp; A kind
Providence directed their flight, for instead of running eastward
across the fields that were just going to be overthrown, they
fled westward into a wood that had little share in the
destruction.&nbsp; When they were about twenty yards from the
house they perceived a great crack run very quick up the ground
from the river; immediately the land behind them with the trees
and hedges moved towards the Severn with great swiftness and an
uncommon noise, which Samuel Wilcocks compared to a large flock
of sheep running swiftly by him.&nbsp; It was then chiefly that
desolation expanded her wings over the devoted spot and the
Birches saw a momentary representation of a partial chaos! then
nature seemed to have forgotten her laws: trees commenced
itinerant!&mdash;those that were at a distance from the river
advanced towards it, while the submerged oak broke out of its
watery confinements and by rising many feet recovered a place on
dry land; the solid road was swept away as its dust had been on a
stormy day;&mdash;then probably the rocky bottom of the Severn
emerged, pushing towards heaven astonished shoals of fishes and
hogsheads of water innumerable;&mdash;the wood like an embattled
body of vegetable combatants stormed the bed of the overflowing
river, and triumphantly waved its green colours over its
recoiling flood;&mdash;fields became moveable,&mdash;nay, they
fled when none pursued, and as they fled they rent the green
carpets that covered them in a thousand pieces;&mdash;in a word,
dry land exhibited the dreadful appearance of a sea-storm.&nbsp;
Solid earth as if it had acquired the fluidity of water tossed
itself into massy waves, which rose or sunk at the beck of him
who raised the tempest; and what is most astonishing, the
stupendous hollow of one of those waves ran for nearly a quarter
of a mile through rooks and a stony soil with as much ease as if
dry earth, stones, and rocks had been a part of the liquid
element.&nbsp; Soon after the river was stopt, Samuel Cookson, a
farmer who lives a quarter of a mile below the Birches, on the
same side of the river, was much terrified by a dust of wind that
beat against his windows as if shot had been thrown against it,
but his fright greatly increased when getting up to see if the
flood that was over his ground had abated he perceived that all
the water was from his fields, and that scarce any remained in
the Severn.&nbsp; He called up his family, ran to the river, and
finding that it was dammed up, he made the best of his way to
alarm the inhabitants of Buildwas, the next village above, which
he supposed would soon be under water.&nbsp; He was happily
mistaken, providence just prepared a way for their escape; the
Severn, notwithstanding a considerable flood which at that time
rendered it doubly rapid and powerful, having met with two
dreadful shocks, the one from her rising bed and the other from
the intruding wood, could do nothing but foam and turn back with
impetuosity.&nbsp; The ascending and descending streams
conflicted about Buildwas bridge; the river sensibly rose for
some miles back, and continued rising till just as it was near
entering into the houses at Buildwas it got a vent through the
fields on the right, and after spreading far and near over them
collected all its might to assault its powerful aggressor, I mean
the grove, that had so unexpectedly turned it out of the bed
which it had enjoyed for countless ages.&nbsp; Sharp was the
attack, but the resistance was yet more vigorous, and the Severn
repelled again and again was obliged to seek its old empty bed,
by going the shortest way to the right, and the moment it found
it again it precipitated therein with a dreadful roar, and for a
time formed a considerable cataract with inconceivable fury, as
if it wanted to be revenged on the first thing that came in its
way, began to tear and wash away a fine rich meadow opposite to
the grove, and there in a few hours worked itself a new channel
about three hundred yards long, through which a barge from
Shrewsbury ventured three or four day <a name="page562"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 562</span>after, all wonder at the strangement
of the overthrow.&nbsp; Some ascribe it to an earthquake, others
to a slip of the ground, and not a few remain neuter, confessing
that providence has conducted this phenomenon in such a manner as
to confound the wisdom of the wise, and force even philosophers
to adore in silence the God of nature whose ways are past finding
out, who giveth not always account of his matters, and who
perhaps strikes an ambiguous blow to convince us that the how of
his vengeance has more than one string, and that, to say nothing
of the other elements, our mother earth may afford us an untimely
grave, either by the slipping of her back or the convulsion of
her bowels.&nbsp; My employment and taste leading me more to
search out the mysteries of heaven than to scrutinize the
phenomena of the earth, and to point at the wonders of grace than
those of nature; I leave the decision of the question about the
slip and the earthquake to some abler philosopher.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>HUGHLEY</h3>
<p>is a parish and village delightfully situated in a lovely vale
four and a half miles S.W. from Much Wenlock; the Wenlock Edge
bounds the parish on the eastern side, and on the west is a small
mountain stream.&nbsp; The parish contains 1,111<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 38<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, the soil of which for the most
part is of an inferior description, but produces tolerable crops
of oats, and wheat is also grown.&nbsp; Rateable value
&pound;817.&nbsp; The land in this parish is the property of the
Earl of Bradford, except about three roods and a small
cottage.&nbsp; A bridge has recently been built over the stream
here, which is a great advantage and convenience to the
inhabitants, as the waters occasionally rush with great
impetuosity from the hilly district, and render the fording of
the stream dangerous.&nbsp; The bridge was built by
subscriptions, under the superintendence and aid of the late
rector.&nbsp; In former times the extensive woods with which
Hughley was surrounded were long the retreat of robbers; a
commission was issued in the reign of Richard II. to inquire into
the best means of securing the banditti, and protecting
travellers from their lawless depredations.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, a small but interesting
specimen of the gothic style of architecture, is dedicated to St.
John the Baptist; it is very ancient, and consists of nave and
chancel, the latter divided from the nave by a beautifully rood
loft elaborately carved; on the roof also is some beautifully
carved work.&nbsp; A recess in the wall containing a number of
human bones is conjectured to have been a shrine; the bones are
probably the remains <a name="page565"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 565</span>of some reputed saint, and were
formerly secured by a door, but this has long been
destroyed.&nbsp; There is a piscina on a pedestal, whereon in
former times would very probably stand the patron saint of the
church.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in the King&rsquo;s
book at &pound;4. 11s. 3d., now returned at &pound;160, in the
patronage of the Earl of Bradford, and enjoyed by the Rev. John
Wakefield, M.A.&nbsp; The parish of Hughley, at the census of
1801, contained 83 inhabitants; 1831, 115; and in 1841 there were
twenty houses and 127 souls.&nbsp; Job Littleford, in 1772, gave
to the parish of Hughley 6s. yearly to maintain a poor child at
school; 4s. to be distributed among the poor by the rector; and
2s. 6d. to the parish clerk yearly.&nbsp; The premises charged
with this payment are situate at Holt Praed, and are the property
of Mrs. Thursby.</p>

<h3>LINLEY</h3>
<p>is a small parish in the Wenlock franchise, situated about
three and a half miles south-east from Much Wenlock.&nbsp; The
parish comprises 636 acres of land, the principal owners of which
are Lord Forester and John Stephens, Esq.&nbsp; At the census in
1801 there were 108 inhabitants; 1831, 111; and in 1851, 105; of
whom 42 were males, and 63 females.&nbsp; At the same period
there were 19 inhabited houses, and one uninhabited.&nbsp; Gross
estimated rental of the parish, &pound;809. 2s.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;729. 18s.&nbsp; Lord Forester is lord of the manor
and impropriator.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>, a
plain, unpresuming structure, has the appearance of great
antiquity: the windows are small and square headed, and there is
a short tower.&nbsp; The church is situated in a field, and near
it stands a venerable yew tree, but there is no inclosed burial
ground.&nbsp; The living is a rectory, annexed to that of
Broseley.&nbsp; The Hon. and Rev. Orlando Forester is the
incumbent.&nbsp; Divine service is only performed once a
month.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Linley Hall</span> was formerly
the seat of the ancient family of Lacon, who possessed the
greater part of the parish.&nbsp; It is a plain brick structure,
now occupied by Miss Martha Onions.</p>

<h3>LITTLE WENLOCK</h3>
<p>is a parish and small rural village, styled in ancient records
&ldquo;Wenlock under the Wrekin,&rdquo; and is situated three
miles south from Wellington, thee miles north-west from
Ironbridge, five miles N.N.E. from Much Wenlock, and eleven miles
south-east from Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The village is pleasantly
situated on a bold acclivity, near the eastern side of the
Wrekin, commanding some fine views over a picturesque and
delightful district.&nbsp; The Wrekin stands partly in this
parish, and also extends into the parishes of Wellington,
Wroxeter, and Uppington.&nbsp; The Willow Moor or Wrekin farm is
situated in a sequestered vale near to the Wrekin.&nbsp; This
valley is supposed to have been the scene of a battle at some
remote period.&nbsp; As a labourer was cutting a drain in the
year 1835, about a hundred yards from the turnpike from Little
Wenlock to Wellington, he suddenly came upon a heap of broken
spears, which had been thrown together, and which it is stated
numbered between two and three hundred.&nbsp; In the immediate
vicinity are five barrows, which were opened about sixteen years
ago, but nothing was discovered in them.&nbsp; The parish
comprises 2,460 acres of land, the soil of which is a mixture of
clay and gravel, producing tolerable crops of wheat, barley, and
turnips.&nbsp; The minerals are ironstone, coal, and limestone,
but none of these valuable minerals are got except on the
northern verge of the parish, probably in consequence of <a
name="page566"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 566</span>their
abundance in the adjacent parishes, where extensive iron works
and collieries have long been established.&nbsp; Lord Forester is
the owner of the land, and lord of the manor.&nbsp; At the census
in 1801 the parish contained a population of 980 souls; 1831,
1,057; and in 1841 there were 202 houses, and 1,091 inhabitants,
of whom 578 were males, and 513 females; in 1851 there were 1,034
inhabitants, and 199 houses.&nbsp; Gross estimated rental of the
parish, &pound;3,760. 10s.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;4,351.
8s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a very ancient
structure, dedicated to St. Lawrence.&nbsp; The body of the
church appears of older date than the tower, which was built in
1667.&nbsp; The fabric was enlarged in 1822 by adding a south
transept of brick; the rest of the structure is of free
stone.&nbsp; The tower contains five bells.&nbsp; The pulpit is
of carved oak, very ancient.&nbsp; There is accommodation for
upwards of 600 persons: 520 of the seats are free and
unappropriated.&nbsp; A neat marble font is placed at the west
end.&nbsp; The living is a rectory, valued in the king&rsquo;s
book at &pound;11. 13s. 4d., in the patronage of Lord Forester:
incumbent, Rev. George Edmonds, M.A.&nbsp; The tithes have been
commuted for &pound;584. 3s. 4d., and there are nine acres of
glebe land.&nbsp; The parish register dates from the year
1689.&nbsp; In the church-yard are several venerable yew
trees.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Rectory</span> is a
commodious brick residence, a short distance from the church,
from which are seen some pleasing and picturesque views of the
country.&nbsp; The house stands 600 feet above the level of the
Severn, whose silvery waters flow in the vale beneath.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Wenlock Hall</span> is now divided into
cottage tenements.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Huntington</span> is
a hamlet about a mile north from the church.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Coalmoor</span> a hamlet a mile south from the
church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Maurice
Haywood</i>, who died in 1760, bequeathed the sum of &pound;10,
the interest thereof to be distributed in bread to the poor of
the parish on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, yearly.&nbsp; This legacy
was paid to the churchwarden, and the parish has ever since made
a distribution of bread to the amount of the interest at five per
cent.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. Alice Green</i> gave an annuity of 11s. 6d.
to the poor of this parish, payable out of an estate called the
Dairy House Farm, at Brierley, in the parish of Sedgley, in
Staffordshire, of which 10s. was to be given to the poor, and 1s.
6d. to the person who fetched it for his trouble.&nbsp; The
estate on which this annuity is charged is the property of Mrs.
Foley.&nbsp; Much irregularity has taken place in the payment of
this little annuity, in consequence apparently of the distance
from which it was to be procured.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Mary Tipton</i>, in the year 1844, bequeathed
&pound;50, and directed so much of the interest as should be
necessary to be applied in painting and keeping in repair her
monument in the church-yard, and the residue to be annually
distributed among the poor.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. Hannah Shepherd</i>
bequeathed the sum of &pound;100, the interest to be applied in
the purchase of suitable clothing for the benefit of the
poor.</p>

567</span>MADELEY</h3>
<p>is a considerable parish and market town in the Wenlock
Franchise, four and a half miles S.W. from Shiffnal, nine miles
N.N. by W. from Bridgnorth, and fifteen miles S.E. from
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; This parish is celebrated for its valuable
mines of coal and ironstone, its extensive and flourishing
ironworks, the Coalport china manufactory, and the manufacture of
superior bricks.&nbsp; The parish comprises 2,810 acres of land;
at the census of 1801 there were 4,758 inhabitants; 1831, 5,822;
1841, 7367; and in 1851, 8,524; of whom 4,163 were males and
4,361 females; at the latter period there were 1,711 inhabited
houses, 47 uninhabited, and four houses building.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;19,900.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Joseph
Reynolds, Esq., James Foster, Esq., Abraham Darby, Esq., Rev.
John Bartlet, Francis and John Yates, Esqrs., and the
representatives of the late Francis Darby, Esq.&nbsp; Joseph
Reynolds, Esq., is lord of the manor.&nbsp; The town of Madeley
so far as regards that portion in the vicinity of the church is
irregularly built, and consists chiefly of detached ranges of
cottages rather than streets; in the immediate vicinity are a
number of handsome villa residences and neat cottages.&nbsp; The
Prior and convent of Wenlock in the 53rd of Henry III. had the
grant of a market on Tuesday, to be held at Madeley, and a fair
on the eve, the day, and the morrow of St. Matthew the apostle
and evangelist.&nbsp; This market subsequently became obsolete,
but was revived in 1763, when a new market house was built in the
Dale at <span class="smcap">Ironbridge</span>; here a flourishing
market is held on Friday, and fairs are held on January 26th, May
29th. and October 12th.&nbsp; The extensive establishment of
Abraham Darby and Company, ironmasters, and the porcelain
manufactory of Messrs. Rose and Co., give employment to a great
number of the labouring population.&nbsp; The Madeley Wood
Company&rsquo;s iron works employ about eight hundred operatives,
and in the establishment of James Foster and Company are employed
upwards of five hundred hands, chiefly in making pig iron.&nbsp;
A house and barn not far from the church at Madeley, afforded
shelter to the unfortunate Charles II., after his defeat at the
battle of Worcester.&nbsp; Madeley Court House, an antique old
mansion in the Elizabethan style of architecture, was formerly
the residence of Sir Basil Brooke, fourth in descent from Sir
Basil Brooke, a zealous royalist in the time of Charles I.&nbsp;
It is now the residence of Mr. George Jones; in the grounds is a
curious old sun-dial.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Madeley
County Court</span>, for the recovery of debts, embraces the
following parishes and places, viz.: Albrighton, Badger, Barrow,
Beckbury, Benthall, Blymhill, Bonninghall, Broseley, Buildwas,

<p><span class="smcap">The Madeley Poor Law Union</span>
comprehends twelve parishes, embracing an area of forty-three
square miles, with a population returned at the census of 1831 of
22,164 souls: in 1841 the inhabitants had increased to 26,172,
and at the last census in 1851 there were 27,626 inhabitants, of
whom 13,668 were males and 13,958 females.&nbsp; The Union House
is a plain brick structure which will accommodate 140 inmates;
the average number of paupers is about 70.&nbsp; The parishes
embraced within the Union are Madeley, Little Wenlock, Buildwas,
Dawley, Stirchley, Broseley, Benthall, Posenhall, Barrow, Linley,

<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a handsome and
spacious octagonal structure, with a finely-proportioned square
tower in which is a peal of bells.&nbsp; This fabric was built in
1795, and subsequently enlarged; it is partly fitted up and
provided with commodious galleries, having accommodation for
upwards of a thousand worshippers; the organ is a handsome
fine-toned instrument.&nbsp; The old church which was taken down
on the erection of the present building exhibited the Norman
style of architecture; a chantry was erected in the ancient
structure and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, in the 11th of
Richard II.&nbsp; Several of the ancient monuments were removed
from the old church when it was taken down and are now placed in
the new <a name="page568"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
568</span>one.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;4. 17s. 10d., now returned at
&pound;305; incumbent, Rev. James H. Gwyther, who is also
chaplain to the Madeley Union, and the Right Hon. Lord
Milford.&nbsp; The tithes have been commuted, and &pound;226
apportioned to the vicar, and &pound;115. 10s. to Sir Joseph
Hawley, Bart., the impropriator.&nbsp; The vicarage, situated
near the church, is a good residence mantled with ivy, and is an
object of attraction to strangers, as being the residence of the
celebrated pious Fletcher, formerly vicar of Madeley, a short
account of whose life will be found on the following page.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Catholic Chapel</span>, a neat structure,
was built about the year 1760, and will hold 300 persons.&nbsp;
The interior has a chaste appearance, and the altar is beautified
with some fine workmanship.&nbsp; The Rev. William Molloy, the
priest, resides in a house adjoining the chapel.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodists</span> have a neat chapel
built in 1841, capable of holding about 600 hearers.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The National School</span> is a handsome structure
of brick with stone finishings, built in the year 1845,
exhibiting the Elizabethan style of architecture.&nbsp; The cost
of the building was &pound;859. 1s. 4d., towards which the sum of
&pound;629. 1s. 4d. was raised by local subscriptions, and a
grant of &pound;230 was obtained from the Committee of Council on
Education.&nbsp; One hundred and thirty boys and one hundred and
twenty-five girls attend the school; it is conducted by Mr. and
Mrs. Johnson and three pupil teachers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ironbridge</span>, a populous and
interesting portion of the parish of Madeley, takes its name from
an iron bridge which has been erected across the Severn at this
place.&nbsp; Here are many handsome residences, good inns, and
shops in all the different branches of the retail trade.&nbsp; A
flourishing market is held on Friday.&nbsp; A market hall has
been built, gas introduced, and the whole has a thriving and
prosperous appearance, and may be considered the focus of
commercial pursuits in the parish.&nbsp; The iron bridge which
spans the Severn is a magnificent structure, and was cast at the
Coalbrook Dale Works, in 1799.&nbsp; The span of the arch is one
hundred feet six inches, height forty feet, and the road way
twenty four feet broad.&nbsp; It was the first iron bridge
erected in England.&nbsp; The total weight of the iron in the
bridge is three hundred and seventy-eight tons, and the whole was
erected in the space of three months.&nbsp; The abutments of the
bridge are of stone, covered with plates of iron, with mortices,
in which stand two upright pillars of the same.&nbsp; Against the
foot of the inner pillar, the bottom of the main rib bears on the
base plate.&nbsp; This rib consists of two pieces connected by a
dove-tail point, in an iron key, and secured by screws.&nbsp; The
cross stays, braces circle in the spandrils, and the brackets
connect the larger pieces, so as to keep the bridge perfectly
steady; while a diagonal and cross stays, and top plates, connect
the pillars and ribs together in opposite directions.&nbsp; The
bridge is covered with iron top plates, projecting over the ribs
on each side, and on this projection stands the balustrade of
cast iron.&nbsp; The bridge being private property a small charge
is made to pass over.&nbsp; Large quantities of iron, all kinds
of castings, coal, and lime are shipped at the wharf to distant
parts of the country.&nbsp; Near to the Lodge Farm are several
beds of fine sand, which is much used by the Coalbrook Dale
Company in their beautiful castings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, a handsome structure of
brick, dedicated to St. Luke, is situated on elevated ground, and
approached by a flight of steps one hundred and nineteen in
number.&nbsp; It was built in the year 1836, and consists of
nave, chancel, and side aisles, with a tower, in which is one
bell.&nbsp; The east window is richly beautified with stained
glass, and has full length figures of St. Peter, St. James, and
St. John, executed by the celebrated Evans, of Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
The church is provided with galleries, and has a small
organ.&nbsp; There are a thousand and sixty-two sittings, of
which six hundred and sixty-two are free and
unappropriated.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy in the
gift of the vicar of Madeley.&nbsp; Incumbent, Rev. John Andrew
Jetter.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodists</span>
have a chapel at Madeley Wood, built in the year 1837, which will
hold about seven hundred persons.&nbsp; They have also a place of
worship near to the wharf, and a spacious Sunday school at
Madeley Wood, where four hundred children are instructed.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Wesleyan New </span><a

Foxholes.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Dispensary</span> and
<span class="smcap">Savings&rsquo; Bank</span> are at Mrs.
Rogers&rsquo;s, Bridge-street; Mr. William Smith is the secretary
of the latter.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Parochial
School</span>, situate on the Madeley road, is numerously
attended, and there is a <span class="smcap">Ragged School</span>
situated in Milner&rsquo;s-lane.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Mechanics&rsquo; Institution</span> was established in the year
1840.&nbsp; The objects of the institution are to afford to
mechanics and others opportunities of acquiring at their leisure
hours the principles of science and the arts, and for the
cultivation of literature.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Gas
Works</span>, situated near the Madeley Wood brick works, were
established in 1839, and the streets in Ironbridge were first
lighted with gas on November 5th, 1839; Mr. Charles W. Smith is
the manager and secretary.&nbsp; An extraordinary phenomenon
occurred at the Birches not far from the iron bridge in 1775, a
particular account of which has been given with Broseley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Coalbrook Dale</span>, a winding glen two
miles from Madeley, hemmed in by lofty hills and hanging woods,
is celebrated for the most considerable iron works in England;
the forges, mills, and steam engines, with all their vast
machinery,&mdash;the flaming furnaces, and smoking chimneys, with
handsome residences nestling under the cliffs of the hills, have
altogether a most romantic and singular appearance, and perhaps
in no part of the globe are features of so diversified and
wonderful a character brought together within so limited a
compass,&mdash;here art has triumphed over nature, and the barren
wilderness has been converted into one of the most animating
abodes of commerce, and being studded with residences of taste
and elegance, it gives the whole a very interesting
appearance.&nbsp; Coalbrook Dale is chiefly the property of the
Darby family, who carry on the extensive iron works here and in
the adjoining parish of Dawley, where they have been already
noticed.&nbsp; The Coalbrook Dale Company is one of the largest
establishments in England, justly celebrated for the superiority
of their castings, and for the manufacture of every description
of iron goods.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Friends&rsquo;
Meeting House</span>, a neat brick structure, was built in 1789,
and has a small burial ground attached.&nbsp; It stands near the
site of a former meeting house.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Wesleyan Chapel</span>, a plain brick structure, was occasionally
the scene of the labours of the eminent Fletcher, the vicar of
Madeley.&nbsp; A spacious school room has been built at the
expense of the Coalbrook Dale Company, where about eighty boys
are instructed.&nbsp; It is chiefly supported by the liberality
of the same company.&nbsp; The room above the school is used as
an episcopal place of worship, and here the curate of Madeley
usually officiates twice on the Sabbath.&nbsp; A commodious
school for girls has been built near the works, which is
supported by Mrs. Abraham Darby; here about one hundred girls and
an equal number of infants are now receiving instruction.&nbsp;
Sunny-side House, a good brick residence on the heights above the
dale, was unoccupied when our agent visited Coalbrook Dale.&nbsp;
The residences of Abraham Darby, Esq., Richard Darby, Esq., and
the Mrs. Darby, are handsome mansions, situated near the works in
the dale.&nbsp; East Field is a good residence at the bottom of
the dale, the seat of Barnard Dickinson, Esq., near to which is
Severn House, the residence of Henry Dickinson, Esq., besides
which there are several other handsome residences.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Coalport</span>, celebrated for its rich
and extensive china works, is situated about two miles from
Ironbridge.&nbsp; The eminent firm of Rose and Company has been
established here upwards of half a century; and the articles
produced at this manufactory, for superior taste and elegant
workmanship, are nowhere excelled.&nbsp; The establishment is
known as the Coalbrook Dale China Manufactory, and is the most
extensive in the kingdom.&nbsp; The firm employs 537
operatives.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;By an Indenture
dated 29th May, 1706, we find that <i>Basil Brook</i>, by his
will bequeathed to the poor of the parish of Madeley the sum of
&pound;40, which the churchwardens and parishioners desired might
be laid out in the purchase of lands and tenements for the use of
the poor of the parish.&nbsp; It was witnessed that Comerford
Brook, in consideration of the said &pound;40, and also of a
further sum of &pound;30 paid to him by Audley Bowdler and eight
others, parties to the said indenture, granted to Audley Bowdler
and <a name="page570"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
570</span>others three cottages with gardens thereto, on trust,
to employ the rents and profits thereof for the use of the
poor.&nbsp; By another indenture, dated 26th December, 1713,
William Johnson, in consideration of &pound;30, conveyed a
tenement in Madeley Wood to the trustees mentioned in the former
deed, upon similar trusts.&nbsp; No further account can be
obtained of the source from whence the two sums of &pound;30
consideration money were derived.&nbsp; In course of time, the
cottages having become out of repair, and there being no fund for
repairing them, it was thought advisable to sell them for long
terms at nominal rents, and apply the money received for the
leases towards the building of a house of industry.&nbsp;
Accordingly, on the 2nd January, 1797, the vicar, parish
officers, and trustees granted six leases of the trust property
for terms of 999 years, in consideration of a sum of &pound;235.
15s. and a nominal rent of 4s. 6d. per annum.&nbsp; The sum thus
received was added to a subscription raised in the parish to the
further amount of &pound;806. 13s. 6d., making together
&pound;1,042. 8s. 6d., and applied in the erection on a part of
the charity land of a house of industry, the cost of which was
&pound;1,086. 14s. 7&frac12;d.; and a lease of that piece of
land, with the house so erected upon it, containing 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 12<span class="smcap">p</span>., was
granted to certain trustees for the use of the parish for a term
of 999 years, at the yearly rent of &pound;18.&nbsp; The income
of these premises, amounting to &pound;18. 14s. 6d., together
with 5s. a year derived from another fund, has been for many
years applied in providing clothing for the poor.</p>
<p>The annuity of 5s. above mentioned was formerly paid out of
premises belonging to Mr. Beddoes, but by whom given is not
known.&nbsp; In the returns made under the Act of the 26th George
III., it is attributed to a person of the name of Johnson, and
there was formerly such a person who had property in this
parish.&nbsp; A person of the name of Bowdler, who held the
premises after Beddoes, became bankrupt, when the premises were
sold, and there being no means of establishing a claim to this
annuity against the purchase, it was agreed that the trustees of
the other charity should receive from the assignees the sum of
&pound;5, in lieu and in discharge of this annuity.&nbsp; This
sum, and 20s. for four years arrears, was accordingly paid to the
trustees, and by them placed in the savings bank.&nbsp; <i>Mr.
William Yate</i>, in 1810, bequeathed four kneelings in his pew
in the gallery of the church for the benefit of the Sunday
school.</p>
<p>The following biographical sketch of the Rev. John Fletcher,
formerly vicar of Madeley, is taken from the account of that
celebrated individual published by the Rev. Robert Cox, curate of
St. Leonard&rsquo;s, Bridgnorth, and other
authorities:&mdash;&ldquo;John Guillaume de la Flechere, or as he
was generally designated in this his adopted country, John
William Fletcher, was born in Switzerland, at Nijon, in the Pays
de Vaud.&nbsp; His father, in the early part of his life, had
been an officer in the French service, but on his marriage
retired from the army, and afterwards became a colonel in the
militia of his own country.&nbsp; Young Fletcher having passed
the early part of his boyhood at Nion, was sent to the University
of Geneva, where he was soon distinguished by the superiority of
his talents, and the intensity of his application.&nbsp; About
this period Fletcher met with a providential escape, which he
never afterwards mentioned without the strongest expressions of
gratitude.&nbsp; He lived for some time at a place very near the
Rhine, where he frequently bathed, being careful to keep near the
shore that the stream might not carry him away.&nbsp; Once,
however, being less careful than usual, he was drawn into
mid-channel, where the course of the water was very swift.&nbsp;
He endeavoured to swim against it, but in vain, till he was
hurried a distance of five miles from home.&nbsp; At last,
despairing of life, he was cheered by the sight of a fine smooth
creek, into which he was swiftly carried by a violent
stream.&nbsp; A powder mill stood directly across it, and the
last thing he could remember was the striking of his breast
against one of the piles on which it stood.&nbsp; He then lost
his senses, and knew nothing more till he rose on the other side
of the mill, in a calm safe place, perfectly well.&nbsp; Many
persons gladly welcomed him on shore; and one gentleman in
particular said, &lsquo;I looked when you went under the mill,
and again when you rose on the other side.&nbsp; The time of your
being immerged among the piles was exactly twenty
minutes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page571"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 571</span>After
Fletcher had gone through the usual course of study at the
university, he was sent to Leutzbourg, a small town in the Swiss
cantons, when, in addition to his other literary pursuits, he
studied Hebrew and German.&nbsp; Hitherto it had been the
intention of Fletcher to enter into the church; but, contrary to
all expectation, before he had arrived at the age of twenty, he
manifested views of a very different nature.&nbsp; Disgusted by
the necessity of subscribing to the high Calvinism of the Geneva
articles, and disinclined to enter upon so sacred an office from
any secular motives, he yielded to the desire of some of his
friends, and entered the army.&nbsp; Soon after he obtained a
commission in the Portuguese service, and was ordered to hold
himself in readiness to sail to Brazil; but an accident,
occasioned by a servant overturning a kettle of boiling water on
his leg, confined him to his bed until the ship had sailed.&nbsp;
Being disappointed in a subsequent attempt to enter into the
Dutch service, he resolved to visit England, partly from a desire
for further improvement, and partly from a hope of obtaining some
situation for his future support.</p>
<p>After the arrival of Mr. Fletcher in this country, he resided
about eighteen months in the house of a Mr. Burchell, in
Herefordshire, under whose directions he studied the English and
various branches of polite literature.&nbsp; At length he was
engaged as a tutor in the family of Mr. Hill, M.P. for
Shrewsbury, who resided at Tern Hall, in this county.&nbsp; Mr.
Fletcher generally accompanied the family to London, when Mr.
Hill went to attend his parliamentary duties; and on one of these
journeys he accidentally met with a poor woman who, he said,
talked to him so delightfully of Jesus Christ, that he knew not
how the time passed away.&nbsp; This little circumstance was
attended with the most important results; and although at first
he felt somewhat indignant at the idea of not being perfectly
acquainted with the nature of religion, yet at length he obtained
that lively faith which, through the grace of God, will incite
men to do all they can do, whilst it teaches them to rely upon
nothing which they have done.</p>
<p>Not long after this period, Mr. Fletcher&rsquo;s attention was
again directed to the work of the ministry; but being diffident
of his qualifications for so weighty an office, two years elapsed
before his ordination.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I was afraid; but now I tremble to meddle with holy
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length his reluctance being overcome, he
solemnly determined to offer himself as a candidate for holy
orders in the English Church, and was accordingly ordained deacon
at the Chapel Royal of St. James&rsquo;s, on the 6th of March,
1757, and preached on the following day.&nbsp; After having
preached to some French refugees in his own language, and also in
several chapels belonging to Mr. Wesley, with whom he was now
acquainted, he determined to return to the charge of his pupils
at Tern Hall.&nbsp; The churches of Atcham, Wroxeter, St.
Alkmunds, and the Abbey Church in Shrewsbury, were now the
occasional scenes of his gratuitous services.&nbsp; In the summer
of 1779 he was frequently engaged in performing the duty of
Madeley, and during the following year was presented to the
vicarage of that place.&nbsp; This living he accepted in
preference to another of above double the value, which was
offered to him about the same time; his affection for the people
to whom he had ministered would not allow him to be separated
from them.&nbsp; The circumstance of his appointment to Madeley
is worthy of notice.&nbsp; One day, Mr. Hill informed him that
the living of Dunham, in Cheshire, then vacant, was at his
service: &ldquo;The parish,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is small,
the duty light, the income good (&pound;400 per annum), and it is
situated in a fine healthy sporting country.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
thanking Mr. Hill most cordially for his kindness, Mr. Fletcher
added, &ldquo;Alas, sir!&nbsp; Dunham will not suit me; there is
too much money, and too little labour.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Few
clergymen make such objections,&rdquo; said Mr. Hill, &ldquo;it
is a pity to decline such a living, as I do not know that I can
find you another: What shall we do?&nbsp; Would you like to go to
Madeley?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That, sir, would be the very place
for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My object, Mr. Fletcher, is to make
you comfortable in your own way; if you prefer Madeley, I shall
find no difficulty in persuading Chambray, the present vicar, to
exchange it for Dunham, which is worth more than twice as
much!&rdquo;&nbsp; In this way he became vicar of Madeley, with
which <a name="page572"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 572</span>he
was so perfectly satisfied that he never after sought any other
honour or preferment.&nbsp; The inhabitants of Madeley, at this
period, were notorious for ignorance and impiety; and in this
benighted village Fletcher stood forth as a preacher of
righteousness for the space of twenty-five years.</p>
<p>There was an energy in his preaching, observes Mr. Gilpin,
that was irresistible; his subjects, his language, his gestures,
the tone of his voice, and the turn of his countenance, all
conspired to fix the attention and affect the heart.&nbsp;
Without aiming at sublimity, he was truly sublime, and uncommonly
eloquent without affecting the orator.&nbsp; He was wonderously
skilled in adapting himself to the different capacities and
conditions of his hearers.&nbsp; He could stoop to the illiterate
and rise with the learned; he had incontrovertible arguments for
the sceptic, and powerful persuasions for the listless believer;
he had sharp remonstrance for the obstinate, and strong
consolation for the mourner.&nbsp; Mr. Wesley describes him as
superior to Whitfield in his qualifications as a public
preacher.&nbsp; Instead of being confined, says he, to a country
village, he ought to have shone in every corner of our
land.&nbsp; He was full as much called to sound an alarm through
all the nation as Mr. Whitfield himself; nay, abundantly more so,
seeing he was much better qualified for that important
work.&nbsp; He had a more striking person, an equally winning
address, together with a richer flow of fancy, a stronger
understanding, a far greater treasure of learning, both in
languages, philosophy, philology, and divinity; and above all,
which I can speak with full assurance, a more deep and constant
communion with the Father and with the Son Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It
is not to be supposed that so zealous a minister of the gospel
would meet with no opposition.&nbsp; The drunken colliers and
self-interested publicans were his special enemies.&nbsp; The
voluptuary detested his temperance; the licentious were offended
at his gravity and strictness; and the formal were roused to
indignation by that spirit of zeal and devotion which influenced
his whole conduct.&nbsp; And to these opponents must be added
some of the neighbouring clergy and magistrates, who objected to
his well-intended but unauthorised interference in their
parishes.&nbsp; In spite, however, of these oppositions, his
piety and benevolence won upon the people, and the church, which
at first was so thinly attended that he was discouraged by the
smallness of the congregation, began to overflow, and he saw an
effectual change take place in many of his flock.&nbsp; Madeley
abounded with persons in extreme indigence, and over this
destitute part of his flock Mr. Fletcher watched with peculiar
concern.&nbsp; The whole rents of his small patrimonial estate
were set apart for charitable uses, and he drew so liberally from
his other funds as at times almost to deprive himself of the
necessaries of life.&nbsp; In order to feed the hungry, he led a
life of self-denial and abstinence; and to cover the naked he
clothed himself in the most homely attire.</p>
<p>The incessant labours of Mr. Fletcher, both in public and in
private, with intense application to his studies, at length
impaired his health, and in 1777 he was induced to visit
Switzerland for the benefit of his native air.&nbsp; He continued
at Nijon, the place of his nativity, and its vicinity for nearly
three years; during which period, though his health was gradually
improving, he was still too weak to undertake much public duty,
but he employed his time in writing, giving private exhortations,
and in instructing the children who assembled, in the first
principles of religion.&nbsp; The fearless intrepidity of Mr.
Fletcher&rsquo;s Christian character was strikingly exemplified
in his conduct towards one of his nephews during his residence in
Switzerland.&nbsp; This young man had been in the Sardinian
service, where his profligate ungentlemanly conduct had given
such general offence to his brother officers that they were
determined to compel him to leave their corps or fight them all
in succession.&nbsp; After engaging in several duels he was
obliged to quit the service, and return to his native
country.&nbsp; As a desperate man he resorted to desperate
measures.&nbsp; He waited on his uncle, General de Gons; and
having obtained a private audience, he presented a pistol, and
said, &ldquo;Uncle de Gons, if you do not give me a draft on your
banker for five hundred crowns, I will shoot you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The general, though a brave man, yet <a name="page573"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 573</span>seeing himself in the hands of a
desperado capable of any mischief, promised to give him the draft
if he withdrew the pistol.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there is another
thing, uncle, you must do; you must promise me, on your honour as
a gentleman and a soldier, to use no means to recover the draft
or bring me to justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The general pledged his
honour, gave him the draft for the money, and at the same time
expostulated freely with him on his infamous conduct.&nbsp; In
the evening, passing the door of his uncle, Fletcher, the fancy
took him to call and pay a visit.&nbsp; As soon as he was
introduced he began to tell him, with exultation, that he had
just called upon his uncle, General de Gons, who had treated him
with unexpected kindness, and generously given him five hundred
crowns.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall have some difficulty,&rdquo; said
Mr. Fletcher, &ldquo;to believe the last part of your
intelligence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you will not believe me, see
the proof under his own hand,&rdquo; holding out the draft.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Mr. Fletcher, taking the draft and
looking at it with astonishment; &ldquo;It is indeed my
brother&rsquo;s writing, and it astonishes me to see it, because
he is not in affluent circumstances; and I am the more astonished
because I know how much and how justly he disapproves your
conduct, and you are last of his family to whom he would make
such a present.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then folding the draft, and putting
it into his pocket: &ldquo;It strikes me, young man, that you
have possessed yourself of this note by some indirect method, and
in honesty I cannot return it, but with my brother&rsquo;s
knowledge and approbation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pistol was
immediately at his breast; and he was told as he valued life
instantly to return the draft.&nbsp; &lsquo;My life,&rsquo;
replied Mr. Fletcher, &lsquo;is secure in the protection of
Almighty power who guards it, nor will he suffer it to be the
forfeit of my integrity and your rashness.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
firmness drew from the other the observation that his Uncle de
Gons, though an old soldier, was more afraid of death than he
was.&nbsp; &lsquo;Afraid of death,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Fletcher,
&lsquo;do you think that I have been twenty-five years the
minister of the Lord of life to be afraid of death now?&nbsp; No,
sir; thanks be to God who giveth me the victory!&nbsp; It is for
you to fear death who have reason to fear it.&nbsp; You are a
gamester&mdash;a cheat.&nbsp; You call yourself a
gentleman.&nbsp; You are a duellist, and your hand is red with
your brother&rsquo;s blood; and for this you style yourself a man
of honour.&nbsp; Look there, sir; look there.&nbsp; See, the
broad eye of heaven is fixed upon us.&nbsp; Tremble in the
presence of your Maker, who can in a moment kill your body, and
for ever punish your soul in hell!&rsquo;&nbsp; By this time the
unhappy man was pale: he trembled alternately with fear and
passion: he threatened, he argued, he entreated.&nbsp; Sometimes
he withdrew the pistol, and fixing his back against the door,
stood as a sentinel to prevent all egress; and at other times he
closed on his uncle, threatening instant death.&nbsp; Under these
perilous circumstances Mr. Fletcher gave no alarm to the family,
sought for no weapon, and attempted neither escape nor manual
opposition.&nbsp; He conversed with him calmly; and at length
perceiving that the young man was affected, addressed him in
language truly paternal until he had fairly disarmed and subdued
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;return my
brother&rsquo;s draft; yet I feel for the distress in which you
have so thoughtlessly involved yourself, and will endeavour to
relieve it.&nbsp; My brother de Gons, at my request will, I am
sure, voluntarily give you a hundred crowns.&nbsp; I will do the
same.&nbsp; Perhaps my brother Henry will do as much.&nbsp; And I
hope your other family will make out the sum among them.&nbsp; He
then prayed with him and for him.&nbsp; By Mr. Fletcher&rsquo;s
mediation, the family made up the sum he had promised; and with
much good advice on one side, and fair promises on the other,
they parted.</p>
<p>In March, 1781, Mr. Fletcher took a final leave of Switzerland
and returned to England, and in the autumn of the same year was
married to Miss Bosanquet, a lady of respectable family and
eminent piety.&nbsp; From the time of his marriage Mr. Fletcher
experienced no return of his consumptive symptoms, and his
general health materially improved.&nbsp; In compliance with the
solicitation of Mr. Wesley, Mr. Fletcher was sometimes present at
the annual conference, when his sermons and pious conversation
became the theme of every tongue.&nbsp; No employment of Mr.
Fletcher&rsquo;s seemed more pleasing to him than that of being
engaged in preparing food or medicines for the poor.&nbsp; On
Sundays <a name="page574"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
574</span>he provided for numbers of poor people who came to the
church from a distance.&nbsp; Indeed he scarcely seemed to enjoy
his meals unless he knew that some sick or indigent neighbours
should partake of them.&nbsp; But with all his generosity he was
still careful to live within his income.&nbsp; If he overtook a
poor person on the road with a burden too heavy for him, he did
not fail to offer his assistance to bear part of it; and under
such circumstances he would not easily take a denial.&nbsp; As he
approached the end of his course the graces he had kept in
continual exercise for so long a season became more illustrious
and powerful, his faith was more assured, his hope more lively,
his charity more abundant, his humility more profound, and his
resignation more complete.&nbsp; After lingering some time under
the pressure of an exhausted constitution, but supported by the
hopes and consolations of Christianity, Mr. Fletcher calmly
expired on the 14th August, 1785, in the fifty-sixth year of his
age.</p>
<p>As a clergyman he was never exceeded in zeal,
disinterestedness, affection for his flock, or anxiety for their
spiritual welfare.&nbsp; As a writer Mr. Fletcher was
considerably above mediocrity, and had he been a candidate for
literary distinction he had talents to have occupied no
inconsiderable rank.&nbsp; His deportment and manners were of the
most engaging and courteous kind, presenting such a combination
of gravity, condescension, and gentleness as few have ever
witnessed.&nbsp; Of his appearance in the pulpit the liveliest
fancy could not frame from any of the ancient saints an aspect
more venerable or more apostolic.&nbsp; The abundant current of
his charity flowed in affection towards all, and his liberal
heart rejoiced in the spiritual welfare of other
denominations.</p>
<p>In the church-yard is a plain and simple tomb to his endeared
memory, covered with a cast iron plate, on which in raised
letters is the following memorial:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;He lies the body
of<br />
The Rev. <span class="smcap">John William De La

where his unexampled labours will be long remembered.<br />
He exercised his ministry for the space of<br />
twenty-five years in this parish,<br />
with uncommon zeal and ability.<br />
Many believed his report and became his joy<br />
and crown of rejoicing,<br />
while others constrained him to take up the<br />
lamentation of the prophet:&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;All day long I have stretched out my hands<br />
unto a disobedient and gainsaying people,<br />
yet surely my judgment is with the Lord<br />

<p>The following is a copy of the entry in the parish
register:&mdash;&ldquo;John Fletcher, clerk, died on Sunday
evening, August 14th, 1785.&nbsp; He was one of the most
apostolic men of the age in which he lived.&nbsp; His abilities
were extraordinary, and his labours unparalleled.&nbsp; He was a
burning and shining light, and as his life had been a common
blessing to the inhabitants of this parish, so the death of this
great man was lamented by them as a common and irreparable
loss.&nbsp; This little testimony was inserted by one who
sincerely loved and honoured him.&nbsp; Joshua Gilpin, vicar of

<h3>MUCH WENLOCK</h3>
<p>is a parish, market town, and borough, having separate and
independent jurisdiction, twelve miles south east from
Shrewsbury, and 148 miles from London.&nbsp; The town consists
principally of two streets, at right angles to one another.&nbsp;
The houses in general have an ancient appearance, and are ill
built; there are, however, several houses and shops of modern
appearance of a more respectable character.&nbsp; The parish
contains 8,821 acres of land; and at the census of 1841 had 2,487
inhabitants.&nbsp; In 1851 there were 2,398 souls, of whom 1,179
were males, and 1,219 females; and at <a name="page580"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 580</span>the same period there were 487
inhabited houses and 17 uninhabited.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;14,006. 11s.&nbsp; The townships comprised in this parish
are Much Wenlock, Atterley, Bourton, Callaughton, Farley, Wyke,
and Bradley, Harley Wigwig and Homer, Presthope, and
Walton.&nbsp; The township of Much Wenlock contains 2,492 acres
of land, the principal owners of which are W. W. Wynne, Esq., and
Lord Forester.&nbsp; At the census of 1841 there were 373 houses
and 1,627 inhabitants in the township.&nbsp; Gross, estimated
rental, &pound;7,440. 6s. 2d.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;6,549.
5s.&nbsp; The tithes have been commuted, and &pound;341
apportioned to the vicar, and &pound;387. 14s. to the
impropriators.&nbsp; Monday is market day, for which the town is
indebted to the Prior and other religious brethren.&nbsp; Fairs
are held second Tuesday in March, May 12th, October 17th, and
December 4th.&nbsp; The fair held on July 5th has been
discontinued within the last few years.</p>
<p>A charter of incorporation was granted to Wenlock in the 8th
of Edward IV.&nbsp; The second and last charter, which is a
confirmation and extension of the former, was granted in the 7th
of the reign of Charles I.&nbsp; Under this charter the
government was invested in a bailiff, a recorder, bailiff&rsquo;s
peers, a treasurer, a coroner, a town clerk, a serjeant-at-mace,
and other officers.&nbsp; The bailiff, recorder, and
bailiff&rsquo;s peers, were justices of the peace; the recorder
held his office for life, and the others were elected annually on
Michaelmas day by a jury of the burgesses.&nbsp; The jurisdiction
of these magistrates was co-extensive with the borough.&nbsp; By
the charter they were allowed a court of common pleas every
second Tuesday, and also an assize court for the trial of
criminals, not even excepting those suspected of capital crimes;
and from the early registers of the parish of Wenlock many
executions seem to have taken place.&nbsp; A court of record was
also held by the mayor every alternate Tuesday, and considerable
business was done in this court.&nbsp; Under the municipal reform
act the government of the borough is vested in a mayor, six
aldermen, and eighteen councillors.&nbsp; Quarter sessions are
held before the recorder.&nbsp; The mayor is elected annually on
the 9th of November by the council.&nbsp; His duties are to
preside at all meetings of the council, and to sign notices
thereof, and with the assessors to revise the burgess list.&nbsp;
He is a justice of the peace ex-officio for the year of his
mayoralty and the year following, and has precedence within the
borough, and is returning officer at elections for members of
parliament.&nbsp; In the absence of the recorder he is empowered
to open and adjourn the court of quarter sessions.&nbsp; Any
councillor elected mayor, but refusing to serve, is liable to a
fine not exceeding &pound;100.&nbsp; The aldermen are one-third
of the number of councillors, and are elected triennially by the
council on the 9th of November.&nbsp; Half of their number go out
of office every three years, but are eligible to be
re-elected.&nbsp; An alderman is to preside at elections in case
of death or inability of the mayor, and refusing office is to pay
a fine not exceeding &pound;50.&nbsp; The councillors are chosen
in the different wards on the 1st of November, by persons whose
names are on the burgess roll; one-third of the councillors go
out of office annually, but are capable of re-election.&nbsp; All
such elections are held before an alderman, and two assessors
appointed for each ward.&nbsp; The recorder is appointed by the
crown, has precedence after the mayor, and is sole judge at
quarter sessions and in the court of record, and ex-officio
justice of the peace.&nbsp; He must be a barrister of at least
five years standing.&nbsp; He cannot be a member of parliament,
alderman, or councillor, of the borough.&nbsp; The town-clerk is
appointed by the council, and must be an attorney.&nbsp; The
freemen&rsquo;s roll is made out by him.&nbsp; He receives from
the overseers, on the 5th of September, the list of burgesses,
which he has to get printed, and expose copies on the Town Hall
door.&nbsp; He receives claims of persons omitted in the burgess
list and of persons objected to.&nbsp; He issues instructions to
overseers to make out lists of electors, and publishes the same
when revised; attends and takes minutes of all proceedings at
council meetings, and makes out warrants for borough-rates, and
has charge of all borough registers and other documents.&nbsp;
The clerk of the peace is appointed by the council.&nbsp; His
duties are to give ten days&rsquo; notice of time and place of
holding quarter sessions; to summon, at least seven days <a
name="page581"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 581</span>before, a
sufficient number of jurors, and to make out a list of names and
descriptions of jurors summoned.&nbsp; The fees paid to this
officer are fixed by the town council, and confirmed by the
secretary of state.&nbsp; The coroner is appointed by the
council, and makes an annual return of the inquests held by him
to the secretary of state, as well as a quarterly return to the
council.&nbsp; The following is a list of the members of
Parliament, the corporate body, and the municipal officers of the
borough and franchise of Wenlock for the year 1851:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Members of Parliament</i>:&mdash;The Hon. George Cecil Weld
Forester, Esq., and James M. Gaskell, Esq.</p>
<p><i>Justices of the Peace</i>:&mdash;Moses George Benson, Esq.;

<p>Wenlock is remarkable as being the first borough that acquired
the right of representation by charter in parliament.&nbsp; The
boundary of the present parliamentary borough is the same as
prior to the passing of the Reform and Corporation Act, but the
municipal boundary is not so extensive.&nbsp; The revising
barristers divided Wenlock into the three wards of Wenlock,
Broseley, and Madeley; Wenlock ward to consist of the several
parishes of Much Wenlock, Ditton Priors, Hughley, Monk Hopton,
and such part of the parish of Shipton as lies on the left side
of the streams called Brockton brook and the river Cowe in
descending the same.&nbsp; The Madeley ward to consist of the
parishes of Madeley and Little Wenlock; and Brosley Ward to
consist of the parishes of Broseley, Barrow, Benthall, Linley,
and Willey, and the Extra Parochial Liberty of Posenhall.&nbsp;
And having regard as well to the number of persons rated to the
relief of the poor in each ward, as to the aggregate amount of
the sums at which all the said persons are so rated, they
apportioned and assigned six councillors and two aldermen to each
of the said wards.&nbsp; The town returned one member to
parliament in 1478.&nbsp; It afterwards acquired the privilege of
sending two, who were elected by the burgesses (in number about
five hundred), the writ being returned by the bailiff.&nbsp; The
greatest number of electors polled previous to the Reform Act was
258.&nbsp; The freedom was acquired by inheritance, and
occasionally by election from a common hall.&nbsp; The whole
precinct now called the franchise appears to have been included
in the original charter.&nbsp; The number of electors is now
upwards of nine hundred.&nbsp; The lord of the manor holds annual
courts at Michaelmas and Easter, at the former of which
constables are appointed.</p>
<p>The town of Wenlock gives name to a deanery, and the Borough
and Franchise were formerly co-extensive with the hundred of
<i>Patintern</i>, mentioned in Doomsday book, which comprised the
following parishes&mdash;viz., Much Wenlock, Little Wenlock,
Broseley, Madeley, Benthall, Barrow, Linley, Badger, Beckbury,
Priors Ditton, Stoke St. Milborough, Eaton-under-Heywood,
Hughley, Shipton, Monk Hopton, Willey, Deuxhill, and the Extra
Parochial Liberty of Posenhall.&nbsp; By an order of Quarter
Sessions, held at Shrewsbury, April <a name="page582"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 582</span>4, 1836, the parishes of Beckbury
and Badger, were henceforward to be taken as part of the Shiffnal
division of the hundred of Brimstree; and the parish of Deuxhill
was henceforward to be taken as part of the Bridgnorth division
of the hundred of Brimstree: the parishes of Eaton and Shipton
were henceforward to be taken as part of the upper division of
the hundred of Munslow; and that the parishes of Culmington and
Stoke St. Milborough shall henceforward be taken to be part of
the lower division of the hundred of Munslow; and it was further
ordered that the day from which this should take effect, should
be the 11th day of April, 1836.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Parish Church</span>, which stands
near the ruins of the priory, is a venerable structure,
consisting of nave, chancel, and side aisles, with a square
tower, surmounted by a neat spire of timber, covered with
lead.&nbsp; The structure bears many evidences of great
antiquity, and the architecture of the Saxon and Norman ages is
discoverable.&nbsp; The interior, during the present year, has
been restored and re-pewed at a cost of &pound;1,350.&nbsp; The
arches, which separate the nave from the side aisles, rise from
clustered pillars, and are very beautiful, having been cleared of
the plaster and mortar which had accumulated for ages.&nbsp; A
lofty round arch separates the nave from the chancel, which
contains the remains of a very elegant sedilia, together with a
piscina and aumbrey, and several old brass memorials.&nbsp; The
Church is dedicated to the Holy Trinity; and from the parish
register, it appears that service was first celebrated in the
English tongue in this church on the 26th of June, 1559.&nbsp;
The church-yard has just been enlarged by the addition of three
quarters of an acre, and contains several tombs, but none of them
sufficiently remarkable as to deserve special notice.&nbsp; The
living is a vicarage, rated at &pound;12. 9s. 6d., in the
patronage of Sir W. W. Wynn: incumbent, Rev. William Henry
Wayne.&nbsp; The Methodists have a small chapel in the
town.&nbsp; The National School was built in 1847, at a cost of
about &pound;1,000, of which &pound;500 was obtained of the
National Society and the Committee of Council on Education.&nbsp;
150 children attend.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Town Hall</span> or<span
class="smcap"> Guild Hall</span> is an antique structure, chiefly
composed of timber and plaster, resting on piazzas.&nbsp; It is
evidently of great antiquity, but there is no record to show the
date of its erection.&nbsp; In the parish register of Wenlock,
however, which seems to have been also a chronicle of remarkable
events of the parish, it is stated that the house over the
prisons, which is clearly an addition to the original building,
was put up in 1577.&nbsp; The interior consists of two commodious
rooms, the first is the sessions room, and over the
Recorder&rsquo;s seat are the arms of Charles II.&nbsp; The inner
room is the Municipal Court House, which has recently been
panelled and furnished with carved oak of the most elaborate and
costly workmanship, principally at the expense of W. P. Brookes,
Esq., one of the borough magistrates.&nbsp; The chairs (two of
which were presented to the corporation by the Rev. R. H. G.
More), as well as the table, chimney piece, and seats, are
remarkably handsome, the cost is stated to have been not far
short of &pound;1000.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Savings Bank</span> is a plain brick
building situated near the church.&nbsp; The total number of
depositors on November 20th, 1850, were 1,909, including
thirty-six charitable societies and thirty-four friendly
societies.&nbsp; The capital stock of the bank at the same period
amounted to &pound;62,650. 12s.; of the total number of
depositors there were 1,061 whose respective balances did not
exceed &pound;20., 451 were above &pound;20 and not exceeding
&pound;50., 210 not exceeding &pound;100., 66 above &pound;100
and not exceeding &pound;150., 42 not exceeding &pound;200., and
nine were above the latter sum.&nbsp; The deposits of the
charitable societies at the same period amounted to &pound;2,608.
11s. 8d., and of the friendly societies to &pound;3,248. 17s.
6d.&nbsp; <i>Treasurer</i>, George Pritchard, Esq.:
<i>Secretary</i>, Mr. William Smith.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Public Library</span> is situated near
the ruins of the abbey, and contains about 1,500 volumes, mostly
valuable works, chiefly presented by gentlemen in the
neighbourhood, and the Duke of Wellington, the Marquis of
Anglesey, and Major Herbert Edwards.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Wenlock Edge</span> is a precipitous ridge about
two miles from Wenlock, formerly densely covered with wood.&nbsp;
King Henry I. on his March to Shrewsbury to besiege that town was
under <a name="page583"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
583</span>the necessity of employing detachments from his
numerous army to cut down the wood and make a road ere he could
proceed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wenlock Monastery</span>, Bishop Tanner
says, that a nunnery was erected at Wenlock about the year 680,
by Milburga, daughter to King Merwald, and niece to Walphere king
of Mercia, of which she became abbess; she was renowned for
sanctity, and it is recorded by William of Malmesbury, who wrote
early in the 12th century, that for some &ldquo;time after the
arrival of the Normans, through ignorance of the place of her
burial she was neglected; lately however, while a new church was
erecting, a boy running violently along the pavement, brake into
the hollow of a vault and discovered the body of the virgin, when
a balsamic odour pervading the whole church she was taken up, and
performed so many miracles, that the people flocked thither in
great multitudes; large spreading plains could hardly contain the
troops of pilgrims, a common faith impelling all, nor did the
saint deceive their expectations, for no one departed without
either a perfect cure or a considerable abatement of his malady,
and some were even cured of the king&rsquo;s evil where medical
advice had been unavailing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Traditions of miracles
worked by Milburga are still preserved in the neighbourhood, and
her shrine is said at length to have been burnt in the market
place.&nbsp; The blind devotion which led crowds of people of all
ranks with their hands filled with rich oblations to offer at
this shrine produced a large income to the monastery, and for
some time kept in the shade the wondrous doings of canonized
saints of the rival establishments in this neighbourhood.&nbsp;
The canonization of saints was for centuries a source of great
wealth to the Roman Catholic Church, and much of their success no
doubt depended on a wily priesthood trumpeting forth their
miraculous powers among the ignorant multitude.&nbsp; To show the
craftiness of the priesthood in this respect we may observe that
St. Dunstan after his death in 988 was canonized, and his relics
were held in such esteem that they shortly after produced an
immense revenue to the cathedral of Canterbury.&nbsp; About the
time of Henry VII. however, the monks of Glastonbury anxious to
bring a portion of grist to their own mill, began to boast of
having the relics of St. Dunstan in their possession, which soon
turned the tide of affairs and caused the rich offerings and
oblations to flow to Glastonbury.&nbsp; This sorely troubled the
archbishop of Canterbury, who had the tomb of Dunstan opened,
when the body was found in a lead coffin in his pontifical habit;
the archbishop therefore immediately issued his mandate charging
the monks of Glastonbury to desist from all further boasting of
their possession of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s relics.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the objectionable mode the priesthood had of
obtaining riches, it is but justice to observe that their
revenues and gains were all expended either in alms or
hospitality, or in building and adorning their magnificent
churches and abbeys; and although learning was then at a low ebb,
it being generally styled the dark or illiterate age, yet what
learning there was then was mostly to be found in the cloister of
the monks, where some attained to great reputation for their
proficiency in knowledge.</p>
<p>The house founded by Milburga was destroyed by the Danes, but
was restored by Leofric Earl of Chester, at the request of his
wife, the lady Godiva.&nbsp; Before the Norman conquest it had
again fallen into decay, and in the 14th of William the Conqueror
was rebuilt and endowed by Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Arundel,
Chichester, and Shrewsbury, a person of vast possessions in these
parts, who placed therein a prior and convent of monks of the
Cluniac order, and made it a cell to the house of De Charitate,
in France; this house suffered the same fate with other alien
priories till it was naturalized in the 16th year of Richard
II.&nbsp; It was dedicated to St. Milburga, and according to
Dugdale, in the 26th of Henry VIII. had revenues to the yearly
value of &pound;431. 1s. 2d.</p>
<p>In the Monastican is the patent of King Edward III. reciting
and confirming the charter of Isabel de Say, lady of Clun,
whereby she granted to these monks the church of St. George, at
Clun, with seven chapels depending on it, namely, the chapel of
St. Thomas, in Clun, of St. Mary&rsquo;s, at Waterdune, of St.
Swithin, at Clumbierie, St. Mary, at Cluntune, St. Mary, at
Appitune, with those of Eggedune, and Subbledune.&nbsp; There is
likewise an inquisition <a name="page584"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 584</span>taken the 29th of Edward I.
determining the right of presentation to the cell of Ferne to be
in the monks of Wenlock.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Stevens&rsquo;
Supplement,&rdquo; seven deeds are translated into English from
the Latin originals in the hands of Francis Canning, Esq., of
Foxcote, in the county of Warwick, viz., the deed of Geoffrey de
Say, for the manor of Dointon; a confirmation of that deed by
Henry II.; another deed by the same king, granting that these
monks might always enjoy the said manor, unless he and his heirs
gave them eleven pounds per annum in churches and other things in
lieu of it; the charter of Henry III. to them for the same manor;
the deeds of William Mitleton and Adam Fitzwilliam about a yard
of land in Mitleton; a composition between Simon, Dean of Brug,
and the prior and convent of Wenlock, about the chapel at
Duddington.&nbsp; The prior of Wenlock, John Cressage, on
surrendering the monastery to King Henry VIII. had a pension of
&pound;80 per annum assigned him, together with the manor house
of Madeley; twelve monks had also pensions assigned to them
amounting in the aggregate to &pound;100 per annum.&nbsp; Besides
the churches already mentioned, the following advowsons belonged
to the monastery at the time it was surrendered, viz., Wenlock
Magna, Wenlock Parva, Clun, Burton, Shipton, and Eaton.&nbsp; It
had also at an earlier period Sutton, near Shrewsbury, Stoke St.
Milborough, and Church Preen.&nbsp; During the wars between Henry
III. and his barons he was often called into the Marches of
Wales, and several documents were signed at Wenlock by the king,
which would lead to the supposition that he was frequently lodged
and entertained by the Prior.&nbsp; The monastery is situated
near the east end of the churchyard, and the entrance from the
town was through a massive gateway; very considerable remains of
this magnificent and spacious fabric are still to be seen, and
fragments are scattered to a great distance from the site.&nbsp;
The great centre tower has long since disappeared, but the four
massive piers the bases of which are still in existence, show
that it must have been built on a scale of no ordinary splendour,
and the size must have been equal to many of our
cathedrals.&nbsp; The Chapter House is probably a part of the
building erected by Roger de Montgomery, and is a singularly
beautiful example of interesting Norman arches, supported on
columns of which the capitals are all of different designs.&nbsp;
It was entered from the cloisters by three richly ornamented
circular porches.&nbsp; Of the Priory church only the south
transept and a part of the south aisle of the nave remain, they
present an elegant example of the early English style of
architecture, but no record has been discovered of the date of
their erection.&nbsp; The fragments of the south side of the nave
consist of pointed arches which have never been open, but within
them there are inserted lower arches of a similar form rising
from octagonal pillars.&nbsp; Over the higher arches are the
remains of a beautiful gallery which ran along the whole of the
second story of the church, and consisted of a series of pointed
arches, divided by slender clustered pillars; above these are
single lancet windows forming a clerestory; between every arch
runs a slender clustered pilaster, and where they break off at
the top are remains of the ramifications of a groined
ceiling.&nbsp; The room adjoining the dormitory was probably
occupied by those monks whose task it was to perform the midnight
office of the choir.&nbsp; From the bases of the columns which
are all that remain of the choir it appears to have been in the
same style of architecture as the Chapter house.&nbsp; The Lady
Chapel was east of the choir and may still be traced by its
foundations.&nbsp; The length of this stately structure from east
to west was 401 feet, the nave being 156 feet, space under the
middle tower 39 feet, choir 156 feet, Lady Chapel 48 by 40, and
the breadth of the nave and aisles 66 feet.</p>
<p>Adjoining the south side of the nave was the great cloister,
which was encompassed by the refectory, dormitory and chapter
house.&nbsp; Two arched doors which open in the cloisters still
remain, but not a fragment of the cloister itself.&nbsp; The
chapter house is an oblong square, 66 feet by 31 feet.&nbsp; It
communicates by a small door with the house of the Prior, the
exterior of which, and some of the apartments, retain their
original character.&nbsp; The whole of the eastern side of the
building has a singular cloister or ambulatory, consisting of
upper and lower story, each of which is formed by a continued
line of arches, that have originally been glazed.&nbsp; Opening
into the upper gallery are two apartments, one <a
name="page585"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 585</span>of which is
supposed to have been the dining hall, which was lighted by a
line of windows somewhat resembling those of the ambulatory, but
having in the angles curious little pedestals, of the height of a
table.&nbsp; In some parts of these apartments are traces of
fresco painting.&nbsp; A narrow stone staircase in one corner
communicates with the kitchen underneath.&nbsp; In another part
is the private chapel, now divided into several rooms, in one of
which is the stone altar, and a beautifully carved dish was dug
up some years ago.&nbsp; The architecture of the Prior&rsquo;s
house would lead to the conclusion that it had not been built
long at the time of the dissolution of the priory.&nbsp;
Fragments of this opulent monastery are scattered to a great
distance, and the precinct included full thirty acres.&nbsp;
About a century ago a considerable part of the ruins was taken
down by an agent of the manor to rebuild some houses which he had
on lease, but Sir W. Wynne put a stop to any further
demolition.</p>
<p>The site of this monastery and manor was granted soon after
the dissolution to Augustine de Augustine, and was sold in 1545
to Thomas Lawley, Esq., who made it his residence, and it
continued in the Lawley family till it was sold by Robert Bertie
(who was the son of Ursula, the great granddaughter of the said
Thomas Lawley,) to the family of Gage.&nbsp; Viscount Gage sold
it about the year 1632 to Sir John Wynne, of Wynnstay, in whose
family it continues in the person of Sir W. W. Wynne, whose
father was happily called (by George IV., when Regent) &ldquo;the
real prince of Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most memorable prior was one Joybert, a Norman, who held
the monasteries of Coventry, Daventry, Wenlock and Bermondsey,
all at the same time.&nbsp; The annals of Worcester state that a
confederacy was entered into in the year 1253, between that house
and this, for the mutual support of both; and the same annals
take notice of one William, a monk of Wenlock, who put himself at
the head of a gang of robbers, but was afterwards taken and
executed.&nbsp; John Cressage, who surrendered this monastery
January 26th, 1539, had a pension assigned him of &pound;80 per
annum.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;The <i>Rev.
Francis Southern</i> by his will, proved on the 19th December,
1778, left to the minister and churchwardens of Great Wenlock,
and their successors, the sum of &pound;300, to be disposed of as
follows.&nbsp; The interest of &pound;200 to be paid to a
school-master for teaching ten poor boys to read and write, to be
continued till they can read the Bible and write a plain legible
hand, and repeat the catechism with Lewis&rsquo;s expositions
readily and distinctly, and understand the first five rules of
arithmetic.&nbsp; The interest of &pound;65 to be laid out in
bread, to be given every Lord&rsquo;s day to six poor widows, or
old men, who should attend divine service.&nbsp; The interest of
&pound;25 to buy Bibles, Testaments and Expositions, to be
distributed on New Year&rsquo;s day among the poor
schoolboys.&nbsp; And lastly, the interest of the remaining
&pound;10 he gave to the minister for preaching an annual sermon
on New Year&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; This legacy of &pound;300 was
invested in the purchase of &pound;640. 2s. 3d. three per cent
consols, the dividends of which amount to &pound;19. 4s. per
annum, and are disbursed in the following manner. &pound;14. 5s.
10d. paid to a schoolmaster; &pound;1. 5s. expended in books;
12s. 6d. to the minister for a sermon; and &pound;3. 0s. 8d. is
distributed in bread.&nbsp; There have been always ten free boys
in the school, and generally twelve.&nbsp; A charge is made to
each of 2s. 6d. a year for fire money, which is the only expense
incurred by them.</p>
<p>The following benefactions to the poor of this parish are
noticed on a table in the church, the donors of which directed
the interest of the several sums affixed to their names to be
distributed in bread:&mdash;<i>Ralph Pendlebury</i> and
<i>Dorothy</i> his wife, &pound;20; <i>William Churchman</i>,
&pound;5; <i>Thomas Lokier</i>, &pound;4; <i>Henry Sprott</i>,
&pound;5; <i>Edmund King</i>, &pound;5; <i>Joan Patten</i>,
&pound;8; <i>William Parsons</i>, &pound;111; <i>Richard
Cleveley</i>, &pound;10; <i>John Clark</i>, &pound;5; <i>Richard
Littlehales</i>, &pound;10; <i>Edmund Hancocks</i>, &pound;10;
<i>Joseph Read</i>, &pound;10; <i>Mrs. Jane Litllehales</i>,
&pound;5; and <i>Thomas Patten</i>, &pound;10.&nbsp; Of these
specific benefactions, the total amount of which is &pound;213,
no further trace remains in any parish book or document; but
there is a sum of &pound;240. 19s. 4d. stock, in the three per
cent. consols, now standing in the name of trustees, <a
name="page586"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 586</span>supposed to
have resulted from a part of these benefactions.&nbsp; The money
with which a part of this stock was purchased was &pound;150,
which had formerly been placed on the security of the Wenlock
turnpike trust.&nbsp; With the dividends of this stock, amounting
to &pound;7. 4s. per annum, 420 fourpenny loaves are annually
distributed to the poor.</p>
<p><i>John Murrall</i>, dyer, by will, dated in 1796, bequeathed
to such poor people as frequent divine service in the parish
church of Much Wenlock, the yearly sum of &pound;7. 4s. to be
distributed in bread; twelve twopenny loaves on every Sunday in
the year, and ten twelvepenny loaves on each of the following
days, namely, St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, Old Christmas day, Good
Friday, and Easter day.&nbsp; Mr. Murrall died in 1769, and his
will having been contested, his executors were not able to
establish any fund for securing the payment of this charity till
1781, when a sum of &pound;250 stock in the three per cent.
consols was purchased for that purpose.&nbsp; The dividends,
amounting to &pound;7. 10s. a year, are now received by Dr.
Rowley and Geo. Pritchard, Esq., and a distribution of bread
takes place on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day and Good Friday.</p>
<p><i>John Skett</i>, by will, dated 13th March, 1727, left 10s.
per annum to be given to the poor of this parish in bread,
chargeable on a certain house in Shineton street, the property of
Mr. France.</p>
<p><i>John Littlehales</i>, by will, 1760, devised to Richard
Woof a messuage in Shineton street, in Much Wenlock, in trust,
that he and his heirs should pay yearly out of the profits
thereof, to the minister and churchwardens, the sum of 30s., on
the 25th of December, to be given in wheaten bread, as
follows:&mdash;Twelve twopenny loaves to be placed near a
tombstone erected by him, before the service begins, on the first
Sunday of every month, and to be given when the communion is
ended by his heirs, the vicar and churchwardens, to twelve
ancient people of the parish, regard being had to those who
frequent the church service; and so to continue the first Sunday
of each calendar month, Christmas day, Good Friday, and Easter
day, yearly.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Mary Smyth</i>, by will, dated 23rd November, 1773,
gave the interest of ten guineas to be distributed yearly in
sixpenny loaves on the feast of St. Thomas, amongst poor widows
and housekeepers of the parish of Wenlock.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Almshouses</span>.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Ann
Sprott</i> bequeathed &pound;10, the interest to be applied in
the repairs of the almshouses.&nbsp; In the parliamentary reports
of 1786 it is stated that a person of the name of <i>Price</i>
left, for clothing the poor in the almshouse, land then vested in
Harry Yate, and producing &pound;4 a-year.&nbsp; With respect of
the first mentioned sum of &pound;10, it is conjectured that it
formed part of a sum of &pound;150 poor&rsquo;s stock, previously
noticed, as an entry found in the churchwardens&rsquo; book, in
1773, states that 10s. was then received, to be laid out in the
repairs of the almshouse, being part of the money due to the poor
of the parish from the turnpike security; but nothing has been
paid for this purpose from the produce of the poors&rsquo; stock
for many years.&nbsp; With respect to Price&rsquo;s benefaction,
it appears that clothing was formerly provided for the poor in
the almshouse by Harry Yate, formerly a draper at Ludlow, in
respect of a small estate in Herefordshire, but this was
discontinued upwards of seventy years ago by the above mentioned
Harry Yate, on the ground that the gift was void under the
statute of George II., c. 36.</p>
<p>At the time the Charity Commissioners published their report,
William Moseley, Esq., the representative of the Sprott family,
appointed the almspeople, and stated that when he succeeded to
the estate he found the almshouses consisting of four tenements,
in miserable condition, and was requested to repair them; and
that he rebuilt three brick tenements, with tiled roofs,
adjoining another tenement in a different part of the town, with
the approbation of the inhabitants.&nbsp; This he did chiefly
from charitable considerations; but he was unable to give any
information respecting the almshouses from any documents in his
possession.&nbsp; He always understood that they were for the
benefit of decayed widows of the parish of Wenlock, to be
nominated by or with the approbation of the representative of the
Sprott family.&nbsp; After referring to the legacy as stated to
have <a name="page587"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
587</span>been left by Mrs. Ann Sprott, he stated he should
decline paying anything in future for the repairs of the
almshouses, unless the interest of that money was brought in aid;
but that if the churchwardens were willing to advance any money
for this purpose he should always be ready to join them.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Ann Minshull</i> left &pound;20, the interest to be
applied in teaching poor children to read.&nbsp; Nothing has been
paid in respect of this legacy for upwards of fifty years.&nbsp;
A legacy of &pound;10, left by the <i>Rev. George Carver</i>, and
&pound;5 left by the <i>Rev. Mr. Baker</i>, noticed on a tablet
in the church, have long been lost.</p>

<h3>MUCH WENLOCK TOWNSHIPS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Atterley</span> is a small township in the
parish of Much Wenlock, two miles S.E. from the parish church,
and at the census of 1841 contained eight houses and 52
inhabitants.&nbsp; This township and that of Walton conjointly
contain 903<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 11<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
the principal owner of which is Sir John Acton.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Watton</span> is situate about a mile S.E. from
Much Wenlock, and in 1841 had four houses and a population of 23
souls.&nbsp; Gross estimated rental, &pound;1,115. 15s. 4d.&nbsp;
Rateable value, &pound;1,016. 18s.&nbsp; The tithes of both
townships are commuted for &pound;54. 13s.</p>
<p>The principal residents in Atterley and Walton are Thomas
Bayer, farmer, Atterley; Ann Howells, farmer, Walton; John

of Much Wenlock, containing together 3,163<span

8s.&nbsp; Burton is situated two and a half miles S.W. from Much
Wenlock, and at the census in 1841 is returned as having 33
houses and 181 inhabitants; Calloughton at the same period had 23
houses and 149 inhabitants.&nbsp; Lord Wenlock, the principal
landowner, occasionally resides at Burton Cottage&mdash;an
elegant and ornamental structure of only one story in height, the
interior of which is very beautifully furnished.&nbsp; The farm
houses have most of them been rebuilt by the late proprietor, Sir
Francis Lawley, Bart.&nbsp; They are good residences, with
commodious and convenient out premises.&nbsp; The church is a
small but interesting structure in the gothic style of
architecture, consisting of nave, chancel, and side aisle, the
latter added at the expense of Lady Lawley; it has a tower
containing four bells.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy in
the gift of the vicar of Much Wenlock, and enjoyed by the Rev.
Samuel Minton.&nbsp; The income of the living is derived from a
farm in Radnorshire of the annual value of &pound;50, and a sum
of &pound;200 given by Sir Robert Lawley to augment the
living.&nbsp; The village of Calloughton is situated about a mile
and a half south from Much Wenlock, and is chiefly composed of
cottage residences.&nbsp; The farms are scattered and mostly
modern erections; there is also a corn mill which can either be
worked by steam or water power, in the occupancy of Mr. W. B.
Childs.&nbsp; The tithes of Burton and Calloughton are commuted
for &pound;74. 18s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farley Wyke and Bradley</span>, a township
in the parish of Much Wenlock, situated three miles N.E. from the
parish church, comprises 960<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span

are Sir W. W. Wynn, Abraham Darby, Esq., and Lord Forester.&nbsp;
At the census in 1841 this <a name="page589"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 589</span>township had 34 houses and 166
inhabitants.&nbsp; Farley is situated in a romantic dale, watered
by a small brook.&nbsp; In the dingle there is a corn mill in the
occupation of Mr. Thomas Harper and Son, which is worked both by
steam and water power.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for
&pound;18. 19s. 5d.</p>
<p>The principal residents in this township are Ann Cadwallader,

scattered houses and a population of 218 souls.&nbsp; Gross
estimated rental, &pound;861. 11s. 6d.; rateable value,
&pound;765. 6s.&nbsp; The principle landowners are the Duke of
Cleveland, Lord Forester, Samuel Meire, Esq., Sir George Harnage,
and the Rev. Samuel Minton.&nbsp; The land is chiefly farmed by
the owners except at Harley.&nbsp; The residents in this township
are chiefly cottagers, and the houses are for the most part
scattered.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for &pound;48. 15s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Presthope</span> is a township with a few
scattered houses in the parish of Much Wenlock, situated on the
Wenlock Edge, upwards of three miles from the parish church; at
the census of 1841 there were fourteen houses and 71 inhabitants
in the township, which comprises 742<span class="smcap">a</span>.
2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 8<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land, the principal owners of which are Lord Bradford, and M. G.
Benson, Esq.&nbsp; Gross estimated rental, &pound;807. 6s. 8d.;
rateable value, &pound;727. 6s.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Wenlock
Edge</span> is a precipitous ridge running about eleven miles in
a south-westerly direction.&nbsp; King Henry I. after the capture
of Bridgnorth commanded his army to pass through Hunel Hege and
lay siege to Shrewsbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hunel hedge is the English
name for a passage through a wood; in Latin it may be called
<i>malus callis</i> or <i>vicus</i>; for it was a hollow way of a
mile in length, full of great sharp stones, and so narrow as
scarcely to admit two horsemen abreast.&nbsp; It was overshadowed
on each side by a dark wood wherein were stationed archers in
ambuscade who greatly annoyed the army with arrows and other
missile weapons; but as the king had more than 60,000 men in his
army he detached large parties to cut down the wood and make a
wide road which should endure for the use of
posterity.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this period we may probably date the
existence of a road over this steep ridge which has since been
rendered more commodious.&nbsp; Many of the passes however down
this rugged steep retain much of their wild and romantic
character.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for &pound;80. 6s.</p>
<p>The chief residents at Presthope are Richard Child Milner,
farmer; Rev. Robert H. G. More, and John Shirley, farmer.</p>
<h3>PRIORS DITTON,</h3>
<p>or <span class="smcap">Ditton Priors</span> is a parish and
village pleasantly situated on the northern verge of the Brown
Clee Hill, eight miles south-west from Bridgnorth.&nbsp; The
parish contains the townships of Priors Ditton, Ashfield and
Ruthall, and Middleton Priors, and has 5,284 acres of land,
mostly of an inferior quality, the rateable value of which is
&pound;3,451. 4s. 8d.&nbsp; At the census of 1801 the parish had
a population of 620 souls; 1831, 620; and in 1841 there were 137
houses and 660 inhabitants.&nbsp; The township of Priors Ditton
contains 2,154<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 34<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
and in 1841 had 81 houses and 359 inhabitants.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;1,597. 1s. 8d.&nbsp; The principal landowners in
this township are Philip Henry Howard, Esq., William Millward,
Esq., and Mrs. Ann Howells; the former is lord of the manor, and
impropriator.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Church</span>
dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is an ancient structure
consisting of nave, chancel, and south aisle, with a short tower
upon which was erected a spire in the year 1831, at a cost of
&pound;231; the roof is of groined timber finely wrought, which
gives the interior a very beautiful appearance.&nbsp; The living
is a vicarage, valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;5. 15s.
8d., now returned at &pound;147, in the patronage of Philip Henry
Howard, Esq.; incumbent, Rev. Edward Ridsdale.&nbsp; This church
was formerly an appendage to the abbey of Wenlock.&nbsp; In the
reign of Henry VIII., <a name="page590"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 590</span>Humphrey Pakington, citizen and
mercer of London, purchased of the king the farm of the manor of
Dutton, alias Dytton, in Shropshire, with the rectory there, late
the property of the Priory of Wenlock, The <span
class="smcap">Methodists</span> have small chapel built in
1816.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Mrs. Catherine
Barker</i>, by her will dated the 24th of January, 1699, devised
to trustees certain freehold estates in Priors Ditton, on trust,
(after certain other purposes specified by her) that they should
out of the residue assure to the use of the poor of the said
parish the yearly sum of &pound;5, to continue for ever, and to
be paid to the parson and churchwardens at the feast of Christmas
and St. John the Baptist in equal portions.&nbsp; This annuity is
paid by Francis Canning, Esq., of Foxcote, in the county of
Warwick, who is the proprietor of the premises charged.&nbsp; The
amount is distributed in small sums among the poor.&nbsp; <i>Mrs.
Dorothy Holland</i>, by her will dated November 15th, 1723,
bequeathed to the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the
parish, the sum of &pound;20 in trust, to be invested in lands,
and the rents of such lands she directed to be laid out in bread
and distributed by the minister and churchwardens among twelve
poor people of the parish, one half on Easter-day and the other
half on Christmas-day.&nbsp; We do not find any account of the
disposal of the money prior to the 2nd June, 1783, when it
appears to have been placed in the hands of Francis Canning,
Esq., at five per cent interest, upon the security of his
bond.&nbsp; The interest is distributed by the churchwardens in
the same manner as Barker&rsquo;s charity, a course of
distribution which is somewhat at variance with the directions of
the donor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ashfield and Ruthall</span> is a small
township in the parish of Priors Ditton, on the north-west side

<h3>WILLEY</h3>
<p>is a small parish comprising 1353<span class="smcap">a</span>.
2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 6<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land, situated in a pleasant part of the county, four miles east
from Much Wenlock, and four and a half miles north-west from
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; At the census in 1801 there were 163
inhabitants; 1831, 159; and in 1851, 144; of whom 75 were males,
and 69 females.&nbsp; Inhabited houses, 30.&nbsp; Rateable value,
&pound;1,888. 8s. 5d.&nbsp; Lord Forester is the principal
landowner, and lord of the manor.&nbsp; Henry Cartwright, Esq.,
is also a proprietor.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Willey
Park</span>, the magnificent seat of Lord Forester, is a spacious
and elegant mansion of freestone, delightfully situated in an
extensive and richly wooded park.&nbsp; The principal front, with
the offices, extends upwards of three hundred feet, and is
approached by a portico of the Corinthian order, greatly admired
for superb workmanship and architectural effect.&nbsp; The
interior of the mansion is splendidly furnished, and contains
many fine paintings, many of which are the exquisite productions
of some of the most celebrated masters.&nbsp; The library is
extensive, and contains a valuable and choice collection of
standard works.&nbsp; The gardens and pleasure grounds are laid
out with great taste, and the park is beautifully adorned with
sylvan beauty, a fine lake adding much to the interest of the
scene.&nbsp; The family of Weld had anciently a seat at
Willey.&nbsp; &ldquo;William Weld was sheriff of London in 1352:
his descendant, Sir John Weld, purchased Willey from Sir Thomas
Lacon, of Kinlet, between 1612 and 1623.&nbsp; His descendant in
the fourth degree, Elizabeth Weld, married Brooke Forester, of
Dothill Park, near Wellington; whose son George, dying unmarried,
bequeathed Willey and his other great estates, with an injunction
to adopt the name of Weld, to his cousin, Cecil Weld Forester,
created Lord Forester, of Willey Park, in 1821.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Moule, author of a work on Heraldry, says, &ldquo;Lord Forester
is lineally descended from John Forester, Esq., of Watling
street, who held a singularly curious grant from King Henry VIII.
to wear his hat in the royal presence; which identical document
is preserved in the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a small venerable
fabric, consisting of nave and chancel, with a short tower, which
contains three bells.&nbsp; There are several memorials to the
various members of the ancient family of Weld.&nbsp; The living
is a rectory, with the perpetual curacy of Barrow annexed, valued
in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;5. 6s. 3d., now returned at
&pound;329, in the patronage of Lord Forester: incumbent, the
Hon. and Rev. George O. Bridgeman.&nbsp; The tithes of Willey
have been commuted for &pound;233. 18s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Robert
Evans</i>, of the Dean, bequeathed 10s. per annum to be expended
in bread for the poor.&nbsp; The payment of this gift commenced
in 1709, and the legacy is now considered to be secured by a bond
in the possession of the parish, given by the late Mr. John
Perry, of Willey, whose executors pay the money to the parish
officers.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Francis Wheeler</i>, rector of Willey, bequeathed
10s. yearly, to be paid at Christmas by the ministers of the two
churches in Bridgnorth; 5s. each to be given to the poor of
Willey in money or bread.&nbsp; This gift is distributed at
Christmas, together with the sacrament money and Evan&rsquo;s
gift.</p>
<p>The following benefactions, also given to the poor of Willey,
are involved in much obscurity.&nbsp; <i>Elizabeth Weld</i> in
1688 gave &pound;10.&nbsp; <i>Dorothy Weld</i> in 1674 gave
&pound;10, the interest to be distributed on St. Thomas&rsquo;s
day.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. Mary Saltalston</i> &pound;20, to be added to
the poor&rsquo;s stock, and the interest of &pound;10 to be
distributed to the poor yearly.&nbsp; <i>Mary Ogden</i> gave 40s.
to the poor in 1680.&nbsp; <i>Judith Corbett</i> &pound;5 in
1691.&nbsp; <i>Mary Evans</i> &pound;5 in 1729.&nbsp; <a
name="page592"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 592</span><i>Mrs.
Catherine Strange</i> &pound;20.&nbsp; From the parish books it
appears that &pound;10 of Mrs. Saltalston&rsquo;s benefaction,
and &pound;10 of Mrs. Weld&rsquo;s, were applied in 1712 towards
building a new tower to the church.&nbsp; It further appears that
at a vestry meeting held 7th October, 1777, it was agreed that
&pound;40, part of a stock of &pound;60, left for the benefit of
the poor of Willey, and then in the hands of Mr. Thomas Perry, of
the Dean, should be laid out in the necessary repairs of the
church, and that the parish should pay reasonable interest for
the same, to be distributed one half on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day,
and the other half on Good Friday.&nbsp; Another agreement, not
entered in the parish books, dated 15th August, 1802, and signed
by Morgan Jones, minister, and two respectable farmers of the
parish, stating that the interest of the &pound;40 mentioned in
the former agreement, which had never been paid, then amounted to
&pound;50, and agreeing to consolidate the principal and
interest, making together &pound;90, and to pay interest on the
whole.&nbsp; From the entries in the parish books above stated,
it clearly appears that &pound;60 of these benefactions were
applied to the repairs of the church, but what became of the rest
we have in vain endeavoured to discover.&nbsp; No interest
appears to have been paid by the parish, but there has been for
many years an annual distribution of corn made by the farmers to
the poor on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, to the value of &pound;5 and
upwards.</p>
<p>The principal residents in Willey are the Right Hon. Lord
Forester, Willey Park; the Hon. and Rev. George O. Bridgeman;
Henry Cartwright, Esq., The Dean; George Goodfellow, bailiff to
George Pritchard, Esq.; Edmund Raby, farmer; and John Stobbs,
farmer.</p>
<h3>LUDLOW</h3>
<p>is a borough and market town, on the southern border of the
county, 143 miles N.W. by W. from London, and twenty-five south
from Shrewsbury, situated on an eminence, at the junction of the
Corve with the Teme, and surrounded by a country varied with
delightful prospects in every direction.&nbsp; This ancient and
populous town is upwards of a mile in length and half a mile in
breadth, having a number of regular and wide well paved streets,
lying in diverging and inclined directions from the highest and
most central part of the town; a circumstance which greatly
promotes its cleanliness and salubrity.&nbsp; The houses in
general are neat, well built, and better arranged than those of
most inland towns of the same antiquity.&nbsp; The town is
skirted by the rivers Corve and Teme, and abundantly supplied
with water by pipes from springs in the vicinity to the public
pumps, as well as from the river Corve by machinery and pipes to
the different houses.&nbsp; The glove trade formerly employed
upwards of one thousand hands here, but owing, it is thought, to
the introduction of French gloves, and the establishment of marts
for articles of a cheaper fabrication in Leicestershire and
Nottinghamshire, the trade declined some years ago, and has now
become almost extinct.&nbsp; Malt is made to a considerable
extent, and there is a paper mill, and an establishment for the
manufacture of blankets and a coarse kind of woollen cloth
chiefly used for horse collars.&nbsp; The town has, however, been
kept in a flourishing state by the numerous respectable residents
which the extreme beauty of its situation has attracted to
it.&nbsp; There is a market here on a Monday for grain,
provisions, and poultry, which is usually well attended.&nbsp;
Markets are also held on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, for
provisions.&nbsp; Fairs for horned cattle, horses, pigs, and
general merchandise, are held on the Monday before February 13th,
Tuesday before Easter, May 1st (for hiring servants), Wednesday
in Whitsun-week, August 21st, September 28th, and the first
Mondays in November and December.&nbsp; Population in 1801,
3,897; 1831, 5,253.&nbsp; In 1841 the parish of St. Lawrence
contained 1,086 houses and 5,064 inhabitants; of whom 3,041 were
males and 3,157 females.&nbsp; Rateable value of the borough,
&pound;12,812. 4s. 9d.&nbsp; An act of parliament was obtained in
1794 for lighting and paving the town.&nbsp; The annual races are
held in July, and continue for two days.</p>
<p>Ludlow was no doubt a town of note in the time of the Britons
from the British name it bears (<i>Dinan</i>), though we have no
historical record left of it.&nbsp; How it came to be <a
name="page593"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 593</span>called
Dinan, a word of no affinity with Ludlow, we have not
found.&nbsp; After the conquest, a noble knight assumed the name
of Dinan in honour of the place.&nbsp; It may be observed that
<i>Dinas</i> and <i>Dinan</i> are words of frequent occurrence in
the account of British antiquities; and upon a careful
investigation, it will generally appear that places so
denominated have been formerly occupied by some chief or prince
of the country.&nbsp; Ludlow seems to have been incorporated from
time immemorial.&nbsp; The earliest charter extant is one of
confirmation from Richard Duke of York, father of Edward
IV.&nbsp; This charter, styling the corporation as &ldquo;the
bailiff&rsquo;s, burgesses, and commonality, of the town and
borough of Ludlow,&rdquo; and conferring important privileges,
has ever since, till the date of the recent municipal act, been
deemed, in effect, the governing charter of the borough, though
numerous charters were hereafter granted by succeeding
sovereigns.&nbsp; The following corporate officers were appointed
by charter, viz.:&mdash;Two bailiffs, two capital masters and
justices, a recorder, twelve aldermen, twenty five
common-council, a town clerk, coroner, three serjeants-at-mace,
four beadles, and a town crier.&nbsp; No small display of civic
pomp and splendour has been here exhibited in the annual election
of the corporate officers.&nbsp; The high bailiff was appointed
by charter to be elected by the aldermen, and the low bailiff
from among the common councilmen; indeed the system of
self-election was strictly established, and so were its usual
consequences.&nbsp; The bailiffs, and recorder, or steward and
capital masters, were all appointed to act as justices of the
peace, ex-officio, within the liberties.&nbsp; General sessions
of the peace were appointed by Charles I. to be held quarterly,
in the same week as the county sessions.&nbsp; Capital
convictions, it is said, with executions on the Gallows-hill,
anciently took place.&nbsp; Prisoners on higher offences were
latterly, however, sent to Shrewsbury gaol for trial at the
assizes.&nbsp; The privilege of burgess-ship was inherited by the
sons of burgesses; and those who marry their daughters were
entitled also to be admitted into this body; for which purpose
they were required to petition, according to a prescribed form
given in a by-law made in the year 1663.&nbsp; A court of record
was instituted by Edward IV. for the trial of debts of 1s. and
upwards, and the trial of issues in all personal actions within
the municipality.&nbsp; Ludlow first returned members to
parliament in the 12th of Edward IV.&nbsp; The boundaries of the
borough were little more than co-extensive with those of the old
municipal borough; but they have been much extended.&nbsp;
Previous to the passing of the Reform Act the borough returned
two members, as it still does, and is one of the polling places
for the southern division of the county.</p>
<p>Under the Municipal Reform Act, a commission of the peace has
been granted anew, and the court of quarter sessions
re-appointed.&nbsp; Petty sessions are held weekly, and a court
leet annually for swearing in constables.&nbsp; The borough is
now governed by four aldermen and twelve councillors, under the
usual corporate style.&nbsp; The persons qualified to vote for
the town council, after the passing of the act, amounted to 307
in the parish of St. Lawrence, and seven in the township of
Ludford, of which latter district the boundary commissioners
proposed the exclusion, it being practically beyond the corporate
limits.&nbsp; In other respects, the boundaries laid down in
their report are extended on the west and east; particularly the
latter, which stretches into the parishes of Stanton Lacy, on
building ground as far as the parliamentary borough.&nbsp; The
following is a list of the members of parliament, borough
magistrates, and corporate officers for the year 1851:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Members of Parliament</i>: Colonel Salwey and Henry B.
Clive, Esq.</p>
<p><i>Magistrates</i>: Francis Massey, Esq.; Humphrey Smith,
Esq.; John Thomas, Esq.; Robert Thomas, Esq.; and Benjamin
Urwick, Esq.</p>
<p><i>Mayor</i>: Richard Marston, Esquire.&nbsp; <i>Aldermen</i>:
Francis Massey; Benjamin Urwick; Samuel Valentine, and Henry
Whittall.&nbsp; <i>Councillors</i>: Francis Boulton, Joshua
Cooper, George Griffiths, Ambrose Grounds, James Hand, Charles
Harper, James Jones, Horatio Russell, Edward B. Smith, Richard
Valentine, Philip Wayn.&nbsp; <i>Town Clerk and Coroner</i>: John
Williams, jun.&nbsp; <i>Treasurer</i>: Thomas Childe.&nbsp;
<i>Assessors</i>: George Cocking <a name="page594"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 594</span>and Richard Jones.&nbsp;
<i>Auditors</i>: Thomas Jones and Samuel Oliver.&nbsp; The
corporate property chiefly consists of that anciently belonging
to Palmer&rsquo;s Guild, which in 1833 produced a yearly income
of &pound;2,120. 8s. 8&frac12;d.&nbsp; In 1840 it was reduced to
&pound;968. 13s.&nbsp; This great reduction was caused by the
corporation having to pay several expensive law suits.</p>
<p>It is well known that the aboriginal inhabitants of this
island made a last and determined stand against their invading
enemies in that district which had its boundary in what in later
times was called the Marches of Wales, in which Ludlow seems to
have been anciently included.&nbsp; This tract, however, might be
extended from time to time, one way or the other, as either party
occasionally gained ground; it is certainly known that Ludlow was
early occupied as a military station to withstand the incursions
of the Britons, who manfully disputed every inch of ground as
they slowly retreated before their powerful enemies.&nbsp; The
Romans are said to have been engaged nearly two hundred years in
subduing Britain, and of the active operations of the contending
parties interesting traces yet remain.&nbsp; Upon the remarkable
hill called Caer Caradoc, historical accounts agree in stating it
to have been occupied by the brave Caractacus, and many fierce
battles to have been fought in its vicinity.&nbsp; An ancient
writer describes this place as &ldquo;exceedingly well fortified,
both by nature and art, upon the toppe of an high hill, environed
with a tripple ditche of greate depth.&nbsp; There were iij
gates, and on three sides steepe headlong places, and compassed
on the lifte hande with the river Colun, on the right with
Themis.&rdquo;&nbsp; Different situations have been ascribed to
the scene of the last decisive action between Ostorius and
Caractacus, but none rest upon such strong grounds of probability
as the stations of Brandon Camp and Coxwall Knoll.&nbsp; The
first of these is situated a little west of the Roman road
leading from Magna to Ariconium or Wroxeter.&nbsp; The second is
within sight, and distant from the Roman Camp about three miles,
near the village of Brampton Brian.&nbsp; It crowns the summit of
a lofty hill, and is of irregular shape, strong by nature, but
made stronger by art.&nbsp; A survey of these two camps by the
antiquarian must be peculiarly interesting, when he recollects
that an Ostorius stood on one camp and a Caractacus on the other;
and that their heroic deeds were recorded by the pen of a
Tacitus.&nbsp; Each particular related by the historian
concerning their respective situations coincides with the natural
position of the river Teme and the camps of Brandon and Coxwall
hills.&nbsp; From the departure of the Romans to the Norman
conquest history supplies no certain information concerning
Ludlow; yet it is probable that there existed here a town or
fortress previous to the recorded erection of the castle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ludlow Castle</span>.&nbsp; It is recorded
in old chronicles that &ldquo;Roger de Montgomery erected the
greatest part of the castle, and fortified the town with
walls,&rdquo; from which it may be inferred, that in the times
and place alluded to a town and fortress must have been
co-incident with each other.&nbsp; This Roger came over with the
conqueror, to whom he was related, and led the centre division of
his army in the memorable battle which secured the conquest of
England, and was afterwards advanced to the Earldoms of Arundel
and Shrewsbury.&nbsp; He was the liberal founder of several rich
monasteries and churches, particularly the monastery of Wenlock,
and the abbey of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Having completed his favourite
structure, &ldquo;Ludlow Castle,&rdquo; he enjoyed it until his
death in 1094.&nbsp; It was forfeited to the crown by the
attainder of his son Robert, who being banished the realm, King
Henry I. gave Dinan or Ludlow, with the territory of Corvedale,
to a Norman Knight, known by the name of Fulke Fitzwarine,
surnamed de Dinan; between whom and Walter de Lacy, Lord of Ewias
by right of conquest, there arose several contests, whether out
of emulation, or about fixing the boundaries of their royalties,
is not known.&nbsp; In one of these skirmishes the said Sir
Walter de Lacy, and his trusty knight, Sir Ernauld de Lis, were
taken prisoners of war and carried to Dinan, where being in
custody, by intriguing with a fair damsel they found a way to
make their escape.&nbsp; Gervas Pagnel, governor of the castle,
having betrayed his trust in joining the Empress Matilda, King
Stephen besieged it, and in conducting the operations of the
siege the king gave a signal <a name="page595"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 595</span>proof of his courage and
humanity.&nbsp; The young Prince Henry, son of King David, who
was actively engaged in this enterprise, having approached too
near the walls of the castle, was caught from his horse by means
of an iron hook fastened to the end of a rope.&nbsp; Stephen,
observing the perilous situation of the young prince, boldly
advanced and rescued him at the risk of his own life.&nbsp; What
right or title the several governors had in the reign of Henry
II. is uncertain; though it is most probable that they were only
governors, without any fixed interest, till the 16th of King
John, when Walter de Lacy had a grant of Ludlow, from whom the
title of the place is clearly derived to the house of York,
whereby it became vested in the crown.&nbsp; Between the
governors of this castle and Hugh de Mortimer terrible
dissensions arose.&nbsp; At length it happened that Mortimer was
surprised and seized.&nbsp; He was conveyed to Ludlow Castle, and
confined in one of the towers, which to this day bears his
name.</p>
<p>In the 47th of Henry III., Roger Mortimer, James de
Alditheley, and Hamo L&rsquo;Estrange had a general rendezvous
with the barons of the Marches at Ludlow, to concert proper
measures for suppressing the insolence of Simon de Montford, Earl
of Leicester, and the other barons who had taken up arms against
the king.&nbsp; The Earl of Leicester, to oppose the powers of
the Marches, made a league with Leoline Prince of Wales, who with
united forces attacked the castles of Hay and Ludlow, which were
both burnt and demolished.&nbsp; Roger Mortimer, governor of the
castle in the time of Edward II., was committed to the tower for
a riot that he promoted on account of his dissatisfaction with
the ministry of the Spencers: being jealous of a design against
his life, he made an entertainment for Sir Stephen de Segrave,
the constable of the tower, and in the midst of their cups and
jollity, he privately gave him a soporiferous medicine, which,
with the contrivance of his keeper, gave him an opportunity of
sliding down a rope, and so flying into France.&nbsp; Upon his
return, out of a grateful acknowledgment of divine providence for
his deliverance out of the tower, he built a chapel in Ludlow
castle, dedicated it to St. Peter, and appointed a priest to
celebrate divine service for ever.&nbsp; In the second of Edward
III. he was made chief justice of Wales, and created Earl of
March; and the same year he celebrated with great magnificence
the feast of the round table at Bedford.&nbsp; Soon after, the
king making a progress into Wales, he was entertained at
Ludlow.&nbsp; The promotion of this lord to exalted stations made
him excessively proud, and he eventually fell into disgrace at
court.&nbsp; He was apprehended at Nottingham, and carried under
arrest to London; all his land being seized, and his chattles
secured at the same time to the king&rsquo;s use.&nbsp; The two
main articles against him were, his having a hand in conspiring
the murder of King Edward II., and his lewd familiarity with the
queen, for which he was executed near Smithfield, where his
corpse hung two days, and was exposed to greater indignities than
usual.&nbsp; The castle, on his insurrection, having come into
the possession of Richard Duke of York, was subjected to a siege
by the forces of Henry VI.&nbsp; As he advanced towards Ludlow,
the army of the Yorkists was drawn out into an intrenched camp in
the fields of Ludford.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Trollop, who had been
made marshal of the Yorkist army, deserted to the royalists,
carrying with him the veteran troops under his particular
command, and betrayed all their councils to the king.&nbsp;
Dismayed by this defection, the Yorkists broke up their camp and
fled, and the Lancasterians entered Ludlow, and wreaked their
vengeance on the town and castle, which are said by old
historians to have been plundered to &ldquo;the bare
walls.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Duchess of York, with her two sons, were
taken and placed in safe ward, and many of the rich partisans of
the duke were executed, and their estates confiscated.</p>
<p>Edward Earl of March was on the Welch border when he received
the first intelligence of the disastrous battle of Wakefield, and
of the death of his father.&nbsp; He had collected an army in the
north and was already marching against the Queen when he was
called to oppose a large force of Welsh and Irish, which, under
the Earl of Pembroke were advancing in the hope of making
themselves master of his person.&nbsp; The two armies met at
Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross, near Ludlow, and it is said that before
the battle commenced three suns appeared in the sky <a
name="page596"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 596</span>over the
field, which approached each other till they joined in one, and
that Edward taking this as a favourable omen subsequently adopted
a sun as his badge in remembrance of this circumstance.&nbsp; The
Yorkists obtained a decisive victory and nearly four thousand of
the enemy were slain.&nbsp; All the persons of rank were beheaded
at Hereford in retaliation for the Queen&rsquo;s cruelties at the
battle of Wakefield.&nbsp; Edward immediately proceeded to London
and was proclaimed king under the title of Edward IV.&nbsp; Among
the towns which had supported the house of York, none had been
more staunch than that of Ludlow.&nbsp; On the 7th of December,
in the first year of his reign, he rewarded the townsmen with a
charter which extended the privileges of the inhabitants.&nbsp;
He created his eldest son Edward, then a mere infant, Prince of
Wales, and sent him and his younger brother to the Castle of
Ludlow.&nbsp; Hall, in his Chronicles, tells us that he was sent
to Ludlow &ldquo;for justice to be doen in the Marches of Wales,
to the end that by the authoritie of hys presence the wild
Welshemenne, and evill-disposed personnes should repair from
their accustomed murthers and outrages.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
King&rsquo;s death, in 1483, the two princes were immediately
recalled to London, and perished there within a few weeks, amid
the mysterious events which attended the accession of Richard
III. to the throne.&nbsp; In 1631, Sir John Egerton was appointed
Lord President of Wales and the Marches.&nbsp; At this period
Charles I. visited Ludlow, and was welcomed with much ceremony
and rejoicing, at which time the exquisite effusion, the
&ldquo;Mask of Comas,&rdquo; was performed before his
Majesty.&nbsp; It is said to have been founded on an incident
which occurred in the Lord President&rsquo;s own family, and
which is thus related by Nightingale:&mdash;&ldquo;When the Earl
had entered on his official residence he was visited by a large
assembly of the neighbouring nobility and gentry.&nbsp; His sons,
the Lord Brackley and Sir Thomas Egerton, and his daughter, the
Lady Alice, being on their journey, were benighted in Haywood
Forest, in Herefordshire, and the lady, for a short time, was
lost.&nbsp; Their adventure being related to their father on
their arrival at the Castle, Milton, at the request of his friend
Henry Lawes, wrote the Mask.&nbsp; Lawes set it to music, and it
was acted on Michaelmas night, the two brothers, the young lady,
and Lawes himself, each bearing a part in the
representation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poem, familiar to every English
reader, has been allowed by the most competent judges to be one
of the finest compositions in the English language, and will ever
be held in peculiar estimation, as exhibiting the fair dawn of
that genius which burst forth in full splendour in the poem of
Paradise Lost.</p>
<p>In the civil wars between Charles I. and the Parliament,
Ludlow was occupied by the royal party.&nbsp; In the summer of
1645, a force of nearly two thousand horse and foot, drawn
together out of the garrisons of Ludlow, Hereford, and Worcester,
were, by a less number of the Parliamentary forces, defeated at
Stokesay, near Ludlow.&nbsp; It was not, however, till the
following year that Ludlow Castle fell into the hands of General
Sir Wm. Brereton, to whom it was given up by Sir Michael
Woodhouse.&nbsp; The Earl of Bridgwater, governor of the castle,
died in 1648, and was succeeded by Richard Lord Vaughen, Earl
Carbery.&nbsp; Samuel Butler, the satirical author of
&ldquo;Hudibras,&rdquo; was appointed his secretary and
steward.&nbsp; A tower is still shown as the place where Butler
wrote a part of his incomparable work, the first part of which
was published in 1663.&nbsp; This poem was universally admired;
the King quoted, the courtiers studied, and the royalists
applauded it, but the author was the dupe of promises which were
never fulfilled.&nbsp; In the midst of disappointment and neglect
he published the third part in an unfinished state, and in 1080
he died in indigence.</p>
<p>The ruins of this ancient baronial fortress are strikingly
fine; the sullen stillness that now reigns throughout these
forlorn and deserted towers, once the scene of royal splendour
and feudal revelry, present a spectacle of the fallen
magnificence of past ages, rarely to be equalled.&nbsp; The
structure stands at the extremity of a bold headland, and its
foundations are laid upon a bare grey rock.&nbsp; The part
towards the north consists of square towers, with high connecting
walls which are embattled; the old foss and part of the rock have
been formed into walks and planted with beech, elm, and lime
trees.&nbsp; These trees having now arrived at maturity, form an
agreeable shade, and add much to the <a name="page597"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 597</span>picturesque ruins of the
castle.&nbsp; The principal entrance is by a gateway under a low
pointed arch, on the height of which are the ruins of the
barracks, which were in constant use when the castle was the
residence of the lords presidents of the Marches of Wales.&nbsp;
A portion of the barracks has lately been converted into a
dwelling house.&nbsp; Further on is a square tower, the embattled
rampart pierced with loops here and there, remain in picturesque
masses.&nbsp; On the left is a range of stone buildings supposed
to have been the stables; contiguous are the ruins of the court
house, and beyond it rises a lofty tower called Mortimer&rsquo;s
Tower.&nbsp; The lowest apartment of this tower appears to have
been a prison, the original entrance being through a circular
aperture in the ponderous keystone of its vaulted roof.&nbsp; On
the north and west sides a deep foss cut in the solid rock
guarded the body of the castle.&nbsp; The place of the ancient
draw-bridge is supplied by a stone bridge of two arches.&nbsp;
The portal was built during the presidency of Sir Henry Sidney;
over it are the arms of England and France, and the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Anno Domini Millessimo Quinquitesimo Octagesimo
completo</i>, <i>Anno regni illustrissim&aelig; ac
serenissim&aelig; regina Elizabeth&aelig; vicesima iertio
currente</i>, 1581.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The court is an irregular square, and not very spacious, but
the lofty embattled walls by which it is enclosed, though in
ruins, still preserve their original outlines, and the frowning
towers and bold masses, luxuriously mantled with ivy, present a
rare specimen of the fallen magnificence of the feudal
ages.&nbsp; The keep is a large square embattled tower, divided
into four stories, and rises to the height of 110 feet.&nbsp; It
is probably the only part of the castle which dates from the time
of Roger de Montgomery.&nbsp; Most of the windows and doorways
are distinguished by their round Norman arches.&nbsp; The ground
floor is the dungeon half under ground.&nbsp; The arched roof is
twenty feet in height.&nbsp; In the arch are three square
apertures, which communicating with the chamber above, served for
the purpose of admitting and inspecting the prisoners, and were
probably intended also for raising supplies of ammunition and
provisions, during a time of siege.&nbsp; On the second floor is
a room measuring 30 feet by 18, with a fire place.&nbsp; The room
communicates on the left with a square arched chamber, and on the
right with a narrow oblong room.&nbsp; This tower measures 46
feet by 34, and the walls are from 9 to 12 feet thick.&nbsp;
Facing the gate is the hall, measuring 60 feet by 30, and was
originally approached by a flight of steps.&nbsp; There remains
now neither roof nor floor to this once elegant apartment where
the splendid scene of Comus was first exhibited, and where
hospitality and magnificence blazed for ages in succession
without diminution or decay.&nbsp; Two pointed arches lead to a
spacious tower attached to the west end of the hall, in which are
several apartments, one of which is still called Prince
Arthur&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; On the opposite end of the hall is
another square tower, one of the rooms of which is pointed out as
the banqueting hall.&nbsp; A spacious chamber above has been
adorned with an unusual degree of rude magnificence.</p>
<p>The chapel was built in the reign of Henry I. by Joce de
Dinan; all that now remains of it is the nave&mdash;a circular
building, one of the earliest of this description in
England.&nbsp; The approach is by a remarkably elegant Norman
doorway, richly adorned with ornaments peculiar to the style of
the period in which it was built.&nbsp; In the interior rising
from the floor are fourteen recesses in the wall formed by small
pillars, with indented capitals supporting round arches, which
have alternately plain and zigzag mouldings.&nbsp; A filleted
ornament runs round the exterior of the wall.&nbsp; A covered way
led from the state apartments to the chapel.&nbsp; In the time of
Queen Elizabeth the interior was covered with panels exhibiting
the armorial bearings which church-yard describes as &ldquo;armes
in colours sitch as few can shewe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From an inventory of goods found in Ludlow Castle bearing date
1708, the eleventh year of the reign of Queen Anne, we learn that
about forty rooms were found entire at that period.&nbsp; Among
these were the hall, council chamber, lord president&rsquo;s and
my lady&rsquo;s, with drawing rooms, the steward&rsquo;s room,
great dining room, chief justice&rsquo;s room, second
judge&rsquo;s room, Prince Arthur&rsquo;s room, captains&rsquo;
apartments, kitchen, &amp;c.; and as in this <a
name="page598"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 598</span>inventory a
table and altar are stated to have been found in the chapel, we
may presume the choir was at that time remaining.&nbsp; In the
account prefixed to Buck&rsquo;s antiquity published in 1774, it
is observed that many of the apartments were then entire, and
that the sword of state and the velvet hangings were
preserved.&nbsp; Dr. Todd in his learned edition of Comus says,
&ldquo;A gentleman who visited the castle in 1768 has acquainted
me that the floor of the great council chamber was then pretty
entire, as was the staircase.&nbsp; The covered steps leading to
the chapel were remaining, but the covering of the chapel was
fallen, yet the arms of the lord presidents were visible.&nbsp;
In the great council chamber was inscribed on a wall a sentence
from I. Samuel, chapter 12, verse 3; all which are now wholly
gone.&nbsp; On the accession of George I. an order is said to
have come down for unroofing the buildings, and stripping them of
their lead.&nbsp; The decay of this magnificent structure soon
ensued.&nbsp; Many of the panels bearing the arms of the lord
presidents were converted into wainscotting for a public house in
the town, a former owner of which enriched himself by materials
clandestinely taken away.&nbsp; The Earl of Powis, who previously
held the castle by virtue of a long lease, acquired the reversion
in fee by purchase from the crown in the year 1811.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, which stands in the
highest part of the town, is a very beautiful cruciform edifice
in the decorated gothic style of the latter part of the fifteenth
century, forming undoubtedly the finest ecclesiastical fabric in
the county, and perhaps the most stately parochial church in
England.&nbsp; The structure is dedicated to St. Lawrence, and
has a lofty and noble appearance; it consists of nave, chancel,
choir, side aisles, transepts, and two chantry chapels, with a
handsome tower rising from the centre, having at each angle an
octangular turret, surmounted by a pinnacle.&nbsp; The tower
contains eight musical bells, and a set of chimes was put up at
the expense of the parish in the year 1795.&nbsp; The principal
entrance is by a large hexagonal porch.&nbsp; The nave is divided
from the aisles by six lofty pointed arches on each side,
springing from light clustered pillars.&nbsp; Above them is a
clerestory with a range of heavy windows.&nbsp; The four great
arches under the tower are remarkably bold, beneath the eastern
arch is the choral rood loft, embellished with open carved work,
but upon it is erected a modern gallery, above which stands a
powerful and fine toned organ, the gift of Henry Arthur Earl of
Powis, in the year 1764; it cost &pound;1,000.&nbsp; The choir is
lighted by five lofty pointed windows on each side, and one of
much larger dimensions at the west end.&nbsp; This window is
richly adorned with stained glass, chiefly representing the
legend of St. Lawrence, the patron saint of the church.&nbsp; The
other windows in this venerable edifice bear evidence of having
once been enriched with a profusion of stained glass of the most
exquisite workmanship.&nbsp; The large eastern window containing
the legendary history of St. Lawrence having been so defaced and
wantonly broken that the various subjects could with difficulty
be traced.&nbsp; It remained in this state till the year 1828,
when the corporation of Ludlow directed Mr. David Evans, of
Shrewsbury, to restore the window according to its original
design.&nbsp; It was completed in a masterly manner in 1832, and
the skill displayed by the artist in overcoming the difficulties
he had to encounter has excited the admiration of every one who
has seen it.&nbsp; The window is justly considered the most
magnificent specimen of the art of glass staining in the county,
and for general effect is surpassed by few in England.&nbsp; The
window is divided into sixty-five compartments, and contains five
hundred and forty feet of glass.&nbsp; The whole of the subjects
depicted in the window are under elegant canopies of delicate
tabernacle work, differing in design; and the costume of the
figures throughout the various scenes are particularly curious,
and well deserve attention, as the richness of colour and general
effect is not inferior to some of the finest specimens of the
ancient stained glass.&nbsp; The window is supposed originally to
have been setup during the episcopacy of Thomas Spoford, who was
promoted to the see of Hereford in 1421.&nbsp; The three large
windows on the south side of the chancel display full length
figures of bishops, apostles, and Romish saints, the apex of each
containing twelve small curious <a name="page599"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 599</span>figures.&nbsp; The glass in the
windows on the north side has been greatly mutilated, but
sufficient remains to show the splendour and magnificence of the
colouring.</p>
<p>The north and south chapels of the choir are separated from
the transepts by remarkably handsome carved screens; in the
windows are paintings representing the history of the apostles,
and also very splendid remnants of stained glass, portraying the
story of the ring presented by some pilgrims to Edward the
Confessor, who, as &ldquo;The Chronicles&rdquo; relate,
&ldquo;was warned of his death certain days before he died by a
ring that was brought him by certain pilgrims, which ring he had
secretly given to a poor man that asked his charity in the name
of God and St. John the Evangelist.&nbsp; These pilgrims, as the
legend recites, were men of Ludlow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ceiling is
of oak resting on corbels, which spring from highly decorated
figures of angels bearing shields.&nbsp; The extreme length from
east to west is 203 feet, and the breadth across the transepts
measures 130 feet.&nbsp; The tower rises 131 feet in height,
forming a prominent object, and gives considerable beauty to many
prospects from the neighbouring country.&nbsp; In the church
there are two highly finished effigies of Judge Bridgeman and his
lady, but much mutilated.&nbsp; The head of the tomb was opened
in 1805 (on sinking a grave for the body of Mrs. Turner) when the
hair of both Sir John and his lady was found perfectly entire;
the coffins mouldered on exposure to the air.&nbsp; In the high
chancel is a large Grecian monument displaying an elegant
sculptured cherub and emblems of time and eternity, in memory of
Theophilus Salwey, Esq., who died in 1760.&nbsp; A handsome altar
tomb of white marble has recumbent effigies of chief Justice
Waiter and his lady; and on the front are figures representing
their issue.&nbsp; Judge Walter died in 1592.&nbsp; Within the
communion rails is a tomb in memory of Sir Robert Townsend and
his lady, with two full length figures, and surrounding the base
stand their children.&nbsp; Dame Mary Evre, who died in 1612, has
a tomb erected to her memory, at the back of which are the
armorial bearings of the family.&nbsp; Upon the tomb is a
recumbent figure resting on a cushion, habited in the dress of
the times and the head covered with a hood.&nbsp; In various
parts of the building will be found several interesting tablets
and mural monuments.&nbsp; Though not collegiate the church of
St. Lawrence anciently possessed a chantry of ten priests,
maintained by the rich guild of St. John, who gave to its choral
services the splendour of a cathedral.&nbsp; The living is a
rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;19. 12s. 6d.,
now returned at &pound;160 in the patronage of the lord
chancellor.&nbsp; The tithes have been commuted for &pound;23.
13s. 6d.&nbsp; Ecclesiastical courts are held here for granting
probates of wills and letters of administration.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span>, situated in
Old street, is a neat structure capable of accommodating upwards
of three hundred persons, and was erected in 1830.&nbsp; The
congregation formerly assembled for divine worship in a chapel
still standing, situate on the banks of the river, near the
bottom of Corve street.&nbsp; Before the erection of this fabric,
in which they continued to meet for nearly a century, the
dissenters conducted their religious services in a licensed
dwelling house, where, in the early part of 1731, they were
furiously assailed by a mob.&nbsp; This vain attempt to crush
them led to the erection of the first dissenting house in the
borough.&nbsp; The Rev. Theophilus Davies is the pastor of the
congregation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Methodist Chapel</span>, a plain
structure situated in Lower Broad street, was enlarged in 1835,
and is now capable of holding about five hundred hearers.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Primitive Methodist Chapel</span>,

with the general charities of the borough.&nbsp; The gross income
for the year 1850 was &pound;155. 16s. 3d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Savings&rsquo; Bank</span>, held in

volumes.&nbsp; Mr. George Cocking is the secretary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Public Rooms</span>, situated in
Castle street, were erected in 1840 by a company of
shareholders.&nbsp; One portion is set apart for the <i>Ludlow
Natural History Society</i>, where there is deposited a choice

animals, &amp;c.&nbsp; This institution was established in
1834.&nbsp; There is also a spacious and elegant <i>Assembly

<p><a name="page601"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 601</span><span
class="smcap">Gaolford Tower</span>, a small structure, situated
in Tower street, has four cells for the confinement of prisoners,
and a day room and airing yard.&nbsp; It was built by the
corporation in the 4th of George III.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dinham House</span>, an elegant and
spacious mansion, situated near the Castle (now the residence of
John Thomas, Esq.), towards the close of the late war was
occupied by Lucien Bonaparte, being then detained a prisoner in
England.&nbsp; He left Ludlow on Sunday, June 30th, 1811.</p>
<p>Among the customs peculiar to this town that of rope pulling
is not the least extraordinary.&nbsp; On Shrove-Tuesday the
corporation provides a rope, three inches in thickness and
thirty-six yards in length, which is given out at one of the
windows of the Market House, when a large body of the
inhabitants, divided into two parties (one contending for Castle
street and Broad street wards, and the other for Old street and
Corve street wards), commence an arduous struggle; and as soon as
either party has gained a victory, by pulling the rope beyond the
prescribed limits, the pulling ceases.&nbsp; The rope is usually
purchased from the victorious party, and then given out
again.&nbsp; Ludlow preserves the custom of walking over the
limits of the township once a-year.&nbsp; This procession takes
place on the Wednesday before Holy Thursday, on which occasion
the boys of the different schools, attended by one of the clergy,
proceed from the church to a place near Corve Bridge, where a
cross formerly stood.&nbsp; Here the Epistle for the preceding
Sunday is read; from whence passing to Weeping Cross, the boys
again kneel down, and the Gospel for the same day is read by the
clergyman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Broad Gate</span>, the only one now
remaining entire, receives its name from an ancient religious
foundation called Barnaby House, famous in past ages as the
temporary resting place of the numerous devotees passing through
Ludlow on their way to the Holy Well of St. Winefrede, in North
Wales.&nbsp; Adjoining formerly stood a chapel, dedicated to St.
Mary of the Vale.&nbsp; The Gateway of Millgate is at the end of
Barnaby lane.&nbsp; In Lower Millgate traces of the town wall are
still to be seen.&nbsp; In 1786 Dinham gate remained entire,
adjoining which anciently stood a chapel, approached by a flight
of steps.&nbsp; The land leading from the bottom of Mill street
to Dinham bears the name of Camp, from the frequent encampment of
soldiers there.&nbsp; Old Gate stood at the bottom of Old
street.</p>
<p>A religious house of <span class="smcap">White Friars</span>
was founded at Ludlow, in 1349, by Sir Laurence de Ludlowe, Knt.,
which we are informed by Leland &ldquo;was a fayre and costlie
thinge, and stoode without Corve Gate by north, almost at the end
of that suburb.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stukeley, who wrote about the year
1720, says, &ldquo;There was a rich priory out of the town, on
the north side.&nbsp; Little remains now to be seen, excepting a
small adjoining church once belonging to it.&nbsp; About the same
place an arched gateway went across the street, but now
demolished.&rdquo;&nbsp; The church above mentioned was the
chapel of St. Leonard, founded in 1590, and intended for a
charitable and religious establishment, the almshouse having
survived its chapel, and, according to the will of the founder,
contributes to the maintenance of four poor persons.&nbsp; Near
to Friars&rsquo; lane was situated the establishment of <span
class="smcap">Augustine Friars</span>, to which Edmund de
Pontibus was a benefactor.&nbsp; There was an <span
class="smcap">Hospital</span>, dedicated to St. John the Baptist,
situated near the bridge, founded by Peter Undergod, and endowed
with certain lands for the maintenance of certain religious
brethren, and sustentation of poor and infirm people.&nbsp; The
annual value at the dissolution was &pound;17. 13s. 3d.</p>
<p>Thomas Johnes, Esq., was born at Ludlow, in the year
1783.&nbsp; He received his early education at Shrewsbury school,
and took his degree of M.A. at Oxford.&nbsp; In 1783 Mr. Johnes
erected an elegant mansion at Hafod, which in 1807 was consumed
by a destructive fire, with much of its valuable contents, the
loss amounting to &pound;70,000.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this
disaster, he rebuilt and adorned his mansion anew.&nbsp; Here he
indulged his taste for literature, employed a printing press on
his own premises, and produced some elegant historical
works.&nbsp; He died in 1814, and was buried in the church which
he had built at Hafod.</p>
<p><a name="page602"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
602</span>Richard P. Knight, Esq., an elegant scholar and
distinguished in the literary circles of Europe, represented
Ludlow in parliament for many years.&nbsp; Mr. Knight bequeathed
his fine collection of medals, drawings, and bronzes (worth at
least &pound;30,000), to the British Museum.&nbsp; They include a
single volume of drawings by the inimitable Claude, which was
purchased for &pound;1,600 from a private individual, who a short
time previously had given &pound;3 for the same volume.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>The Grammar
School</i>.&mdash;It appears that all the premises specified in a
certain grant, and constituting the possessions of the Guild or
Fraternity of Palmers, had been unconditionally surrendered by
them to King Edward VI. by deed under their common seal, dated
1st June, in the fifth of his reign.&nbsp; The property thus
unconditionally surrendered to the king was granted by him to the
corporation for the relief and better sustaining of the town and
borough of Ludlow, and for the corporation, &ldquo;<i>at their
own costs and charges</i>,&rdquo; to maintain a free grammar
school, and other charitable institutions mentioned in the
charter.&nbsp; It appears the legal import of the charter was not
to grant the property upon trust to employ the whole of the rents
and profits to the maintenance of the charities, but to make a
beneficial grant of it to the corporation, coupled with a
condition that they should, out of the income they thus acquired,
sufficiently maintain the charitable institutions therein
specified.&nbsp; The school premises comprise two houses, in
which the master resides.&nbsp; About fifty years ago, the
premises were nearly rebuilt, at a cost of &pound;700.&nbsp; The
school is open to the whole town, without any limitation of
number, on payment of &pound;3 annually.&nbsp; Four of the boys,
nominated by the bailiffs, receive a benefaction of &pound;2.
13s. 4d. per annum, under the will of <i>Dr. Langford</i>.&nbsp;
The school is also entitled to two exhibitions of &pound;45 to
Baliol College, Oxford, for 11 years, founded by the <i>Rev.
Richard Greaves</i> in the year 1704.&nbsp; There are also three
exhibitions of &pound;50 for three years to any college in
Oxford, Cambridge, or Durham.&nbsp; It is stated in the
particular of the Guild estate, that &ldquo;there is an almshouse
to the Guild appertaining, with thirty-three chambers therein
inhabited by poor people, according to the foundation and
ordinance of <i>John Hoyser</i>, to every of which poor people is
weekly allowed 4d.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Palmers
Guild</span> was a religious fraternity, established about the
year 1248, for the relief of the poor, and for the administration
of charitable bequests.&nbsp; Before the period of the
Reformation, their funds had increased so considerably that they
formed a college, with a warden for three priests, and maintained
the above almshouse for thirty-three poor people, and the grammar
school.&nbsp; On the passing of the Municipal Act, in 1835, it
became necessary to separate the charity from the municipal
property; and, after much litigation, lands yielding a clear
rental of &pound;1,800 a-year were secured to the charity for the
purpose of maintaining the above-named objects.&nbsp; The
preacher, now called the lecturer (and who, as well as the
assistant, is appointed by the corporation), received from them a
salary of &pound;26. 13s. 4d. per annum, when the Charity
Commissioners published their report.&nbsp; It appears that the
Palmers Guild had been used to pay yearly to a schoolmaster, for
keeping a free grammar school, &pound;10; to one priest,
&pound;6; and to two others, &pound;5. 6s. 8d. each.&nbsp; The
particular duties of these priests are not specified; but it
seems probable that the usher, preacher, and assistant, were
intended to be substituted by the charter in their stead.</p>
<p>From an old book belonging to the corporation, containing
copies of wills and other documents relating to the charities of
the town, it appears that <i>James Walters</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, in
1624, devised an annuity of &pound;20 to be paid out of his lands
in Stanton Lacy and Richards Castle; &pound;10 thereof to be
distributed among the inmates of the almshouse, and &pound;10 to
be bestowed on the preacher.&nbsp; It appears that a fee farm
rent of &pound;24. 13s. 4d., reserved by a charter of King Edward
IV., out of certain lands granted to the corporation of Ludlow,
and also the rent of &pound;8. 13s. 4d., reserved by charter of
King Edward VI., eventually became vested in the corporation; and
&pound;20 is now paid to the treasurer of the national school,
and the remainder, &pound;13. 6s. 8d., is considered as forming a
part of the weekly payments to the almspeople.</p>
<p><a name="page603"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
603</span><i>Thomas Candland</i>, by will dated 1617, gave a
house and shop in Ludlow to William Bevan and Alice his wife, and
their heirs, in trust, that they should pay annually the sum of
20s. out of the profits thereof to the bailiffs of the town, to
be disposed of by them; to every chamber in the almshouse, 4d.;
and the residue of the said 20s. to such other poor of Ludlow as
they should think fit.&nbsp; <i>William Archer</i>, by deed dated
1677, charged his close, called Sutton&rsquo;s close, with a
yearly rent of 20s., to be divided among the poor in the
almshouse near the parish of St. Lawrence.&nbsp; <i>Susan
Gay</i>, by indenture dated 1724, conveyed to Richard Plummer and
his heirs, a piece of land called Old Hill, in Kingsland parish,
in Herefordshire, in trust, that after her death the bailiffs,
rector, lecturer and reader of Ludlow for the time being, should
receive from the rents and profits thereof an annuity of &pound;7
for ever; &pound;6 thereof to be yearly distributed among the
poor of the almshouses in the upper room and in Corve street, and
20s. to the person who received the rent and looked after the
estate.&nbsp; An annual sum of 13s. 4d, from one of the Earl of
Powis&rsquo;s stewards, which is distributed among the 33
almspeople in the upper almshouse.&nbsp; The origin of this
payment is not known.&nbsp; <i>Mary Beetenson</i>, who died about
the year 1806, bequeathed to the bailiffs of the town of Ludlow,
and their successors, the sum of &pound;100, to be placed out at
interest, and distributed to the poor people inhabiting the
almshouse opposite the church of St. Lawrence.&nbsp; <i>Ann
Smith</i> in 1809 gave &pound;50 to the corporation of Ludlow, in
trust, to be placed out at interest, and distributed in coals to
the poor inhabiting the upper almshouse.&nbsp; <i>Susannah
Smith</i>, by will in 1801, gave to the rector of the parish of
St. Lawrence, in Ludlow, the sum of &pound;100 to be placed out
at interest, and distributed among the inhabitants of the
almshouses near the church.&nbsp; These small payments amount
annually to the sum of 12s. 5&frac34;d, for each of the
almspeople.</p>
<p><i>Charles Foxe</i>, by his will dated 1590, after reciting
that he had lately purchased the chapel of St. Leonard, in Corve
street, Ludlow, and a parcel of ground near thereto, whereon he
had begun to erect four almshouses, for four poor and impotent
persons, gave and bequeathed to certain trustees, in trust, four
messuages, and all lands, tenements and hereditaments, with their
appurtenances, situated in the city of Worcester, of the annual
value of &pound;8; to be by them so settled that out of the rents
&pound;4 should be paid to the four poor persons in the
almshouse, and divided amongst them quarterly.&nbsp; To the
curate of Ludford, or some other sufficient minister, for reading
divine service to the poor there, the sum of 40s. yearly.&nbsp;
To some learned preacher for a sermon in the said chapel at
Christmas, 6s. 8d.; and the like sum for a sermon there in
Lent.&nbsp; And the residue of the rents (being &pound;1. 6s.
8d.) he directed to be employed for the necessary repairing the
said almshouses and chapel, and other necessary charges.&nbsp; He
gave two bells to be hung up in the steeple of the chapel.&nbsp;
About the year 1751 the chapel had gone greatly to decay, and the
houses in Worcester become so ruinous and incapable of repair,
that in 1758 the ground on which the tenements stood was let on
building leases, at an annual rent of &pound;11. 9s. 6d., for 99
years.&nbsp; James Foxe the trustee, by deed in 1769, conveyed to
the bailiffs, burgesses and commonalty of Ludlow, the aforesaid
premises, in trust, for the support of the almshouse, in
consequence of his residing so remote from Ludlow.&nbsp; The
present income of the charity is &pound;14. 13s. 10d.&nbsp; The
almshouse consists of four dwellings, with a garden to each, and
is inhabited by two poor persons from the parish of Bromfield,
and two from Ludlow; who also receive from the corporation 1s.
6d. per week each, and 3s. 2d. yearly from Mrs. Susan Gay&rsquo;s
benefaction.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Lane</i>, by will in 1674, after giving certain
legacies, bequeathed all the rest of his estate to Sir Job
Charlton and two others, to be disposed of by them as he should
appoint; and in default of such appointment, to some charitable
use according to their best discretion.&nbsp; From the will of
Sir Job Charlton, bearing date 1691, it appears that the money
derived from this bequest had been employed in repairing and
furnishing an old house which had been granted to the trustees by
the town of Ludlow, and in purchasing certain lands in Middleton
of the annual value of &pound;30.&nbsp; Under the residuary
clause of <a name="page604"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
604</span>Thomas Lane&rsquo;s will, a reversion passed to the use
of this charity of a dwelling house, a garden, and two meadows,
containing 5<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 9<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
which had been granted to his wife by a codicil to his
will.&nbsp; These lands, comprising an area of 74<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 9<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, and let at an annual rent of
&pound;44 per annum, were exchanged in 1790 with C. W. B. Rouse,
Esq. for meadow and pasture lands, situated in Stanton Lacy,
containing 41<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 7<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
let for &pound;56 per annum.&nbsp; At the time the charity
commissioners published their report, the income of the charity
amounted to &pound;120, (exclusive of the interest of &pound;216.
8s. 3d., the amount of a balance due in 1816, arising from
savings of income,) which was applied in paying to the governor
of the workhouse a salary of &pound;20; in disbursements for
taxes and repairs of the building and furniture; and in providing
flax, hemp and yarn for making stockings, and leather for shoes,
for the poor people in the house to work up.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Lane</i>, by a second codicil to his will, in 1676,
devised his closes of meadow and pasture land, lying near the
east side of Broad street, in Ludlow, to be conveyed to feoffees
in trust, that the rents and profits should be weekly disposed of
in bread and money to twelve poor widows of the town of
Ludlow.&nbsp; The land contains 1<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 34<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
which produces an annual income of &pound;23. 10s.</p>
<p>From an entry in an old book belonging to the corporation, it
appears that <i>Evan Phillips</i> gave &pound;22 to remain a
stock for ever for the poor of the town of Ludlow; and directed
certain trustees to dispose of the same in the purchase of lands,
or otherwise, as they should think fit; the profits of the
&pound;20 to be given to twelve poor persons, and the remaining
40s. to be spent by the trustees, for their recreation, at their
meetings on the business of the charity.&nbsp; It appears from
the same book that he also gave a judgment debt of &pound;10, due
to him, for the use of six more poor persons of Ludlow.&nbsp;
There is now a piece of land in Lynney appropriated to this
charity, called the Poor&rsquo;s Close, containing 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 26<span class="smcap">p</span>., which is
let at an annual rent of &pound;13; of which &pound;12. 6s. 8d.
is distributed among eighteen poor persons by the bailiffs of the
town.</p>
<p><i>Richard Davies</i>, by will dated 1699, bequeathed
&pound;100 to be laid out in lands, in trust, to distribute the
rents and profits among eight poor widows of Ludlow, not
partakers of any other charity in the town.&nbsp; In respect of
this sum the corporation make an annual payment of &pound;6,
which is distributed as the donor directed.&nbsp; <i>Eleanor
Handford</i> left &pound;25, the interest thereof to be given to
ten poor persons in Castle street ward on Good Friday,
yearly.&nbsp; <i>John Long</i>, by will, gave to the poor of the
parish of St. Lawrence, in Ludlow, the sum of &pound;20, the
interest thereof to be distributed among the poor.&nbsp; There is
also found copied into the charity book a statement that Mrs.
Robinson left &pound;100 to the poor of Ludlow, the interest to
be applied as follows; viz.: 50s. to the Charity school, and 50s.
to twenty poor housekeepers, to be named by the bailiffs and
rector on St. John the Evangelist&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Meyricke</i>, by will, dated 1724, bequeathed to the
bailiffs, burgesses, and commonalty &pound;40, in trust, to lend
it from time to time to four poor tradesmen, not being ale
sellers for three years, without interest, in sums of &pound;10
each, upon sufficient security.&nbsp; <i>Sir Timothy
Tourueur</i>, <i>Knight</i>, also gave &pound;100, to be lent for
a like time to four young tradesmen upon good security.&nbsp;
Thomas Meyricke also bequeathed &pound;40, the interest to be
paid to the charity schools at Ludlow.</p>
<p><i>Richard Gwilliams</i>, by will, dated 1629, gave to the
parson of Ludlow and vicar of Leominster, and the vicar of Kings
Capel &pound;3 a year, issuing out of all his messuages, lands,
tenements, and hereditaments in the county of Hereford, to the
intent that they should distribute 20s. thereof yearly to the
poor impotent people of each of those places.</p>
<p><i>Charles Sonnibank</i>, <i>D.D.</i>, by deed dated 10th of
October, 10th Charles I., after reciting a grant made by him to
Margaret Postern and her heirs of a messuage and lands containing
about 155 acres, situated at Brome, in the parish of Hopesay, in
Shropshire, reserving to him and his heirs a rent of &pound;13.
6s. 8d., granted the said rent to trustees, in trust, to
distribute it among ten poor widows inhabiting Ludlow, in weekly
payments of 6d. each, and the parson to retain 6s. 8d. for his
care in receiving it.</p>
<p><a name="page605"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
605</span><i>Robert Horne</i>, by will, dated 1640, gave to the
rector and rectors of the parish church of St. Lawrence, in
Ludlow, for the time being for ever, a rent charge of &pound;10
per annum issuing out of lands in the parish of Kingsland, in the
county of Hereford.</p>
<p><i>Jane Higginson</i>, by will, dated 1707&ndash;8, gave
&pound;5 per annum to five decayed tradesmen&rsquo;s widows in
Ludlow, for keeping clean the chancel of the church, to be paid
on the 28th day of February.&nbsp; She likewise gave an annuity
of &pound;5 to the rector of Ludlow and his successors for
ever.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Richard Morgan</i>, in 1766, left &pound;140, in
trust, the interest therefrom to be expended in teaching poor
children.&nbsp; The present fund derived from this bequest is
&pound;120, three per cent. consols, the dividends of which are
&pound;3. 12s. per annum, which is now paid to the national
school.&nbsp; There was an ancient charity school in Ludlow
called the Blue Coat School, which has formed the basis of a
national school now established there.&nbsp; It has been seen in
the report of Tonlyne&rsquo;s charity that in the year 1716 it
was ordered by the corporation that &pound;20 should be secured
to the trustees of this charity school out of the tolls of the
market, as forming part of Mr. Tonlyne&rsquo;s charity.&nbsp;
From an entry in the corporation ledger in 1782 it appears that
this sum of &pound;20 was paid by the chamberlain to the
treasurer of the charity school till the 28th of October, 1761,
from which time it had been in arrear; and that this arrear,
together with the interest of the several sums of &pound;100,
&pound;50, and &pound;40 due to the charity school on several
bonds from the corporation, then amounted to the sum of
&pound;629, which sum was afterwards invested in the purchase of
&pound;1,000, three per cent. consols.&nbsp; It appears from the
ledger that on the 29th of October, 1806, a further arrear of the
annuity and of the interest on the bonds had occurred, which left
a balance due from the corporation of &pound;458.&nbsp; This
balance it was resolved to apply in the purchase of a
schoolhouse, which was effected in 1815.&nbsp; The purchase money
of this house, with the charges of repairing and fitting up,
amounted to &pound;600. 13s., exceeding the amount of the arrears
by &pound;142. 13s., which was paid out of the corporation
funds.&nbsp; From the year 1806 the annuity of &pound;20 was paid
by the charity school till its combination with the national
school.&nbsp; The house is now used for the female department of
the national school.&nbsp; The children of the Blue Coat School
were clothed, and accordingly clothing to the amount of &pound;27
a year is now given to children in the national school, chosen by
the subscribers in rotation.&nbsp; These children are also put
out apprentice with a premium of &pound;3 each.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Hollingworth</i>, by will, dated 1809, gave
&pound;50 four per cent. bank annuities, to be transferred to the
rector and churchwardens of St. Lawrence, Ludlow, the dividends
to be laid out in bread and distributed at Christmas to poor
widows, inhabitants of the said parish.&nbsp; <i>Richard
Nash</i>, by will, dated 1814, gave to the ministers and
churchwardens of the parish of St. Lawrence, Ludlow, &pound;100,
the interest thereof to be distributed among the poor of the
parish.&nbsp; <i>Lost Charities</i>: Among the books of the
corporation are mentioned charities left by six several donors,
amounting in the whole to &pound;200, which have long been lost
to the poor.</p>

acres of land, the rateable value of which is &pound;1,334. 5s.
6d.&nbsp; Abraham Stephen Cresswell, Esq., is lord of the manor
and the principal landowner.&nbsp; Dr. Jenkins is also a
considerable owner; and John M. Wingfield, Esq., the Misses
Cresswell, Mr. Richard Palmer, and Mr. Stephen Cresswell, are
also freeholders.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>John Grove</i>,
by will, dated 10th of December, 1616, bequeathed a yearly
stipend of &pound;10 to the schoolmaster of Alveley, and a like
yearly payment of &pound;10, to have continuance for ever, to be
distributed among five poor aged and impotent men.&nbsp; For the
<a name="page612"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
612</span>establishing of these yearly stipends, the executors
purchased a messuage, with the appurtenances, called Longhurst,
situated in Ledbury and Eastnor, in Herefordshire, which
contained 74<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 4<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
and which was exchanged with Charles Lord Somers in the year 1793
for certain lands in Alveley parish, containing 111<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>. 27<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, which was held at the time the
Charity Commissioners published their report at a rent of
&pound;73 per annum.&nbsp; The schoolmaster&rsquo;s stipend was
increased in 1800 to &pound;20, and has since been augmented to
&pound;25, with a house rent free, and an allowance of two loads
of coal; and five poor men of Alveley receive from this charity a
yearly stipend of &pound;6 each.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Grove</i>, in 1743, left certain lands, comprising
31<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span class="smcap">r</span>.
0<span class="smcap">p</span>., upon trust, that the annual rents
and profits should be divided among the poor of the parish of
Alveley.&nbsp; The land is let to several tenants, at a rent of
&pound;42 per annum.</p>
<p>This parish participates in the charity of <i>Mr. William
Seabright</i>, who, by his will, dated 1620, gave certain
premises, the rents thereof to be employed towards the relief of
the poor of several parishes in Worcester, Stafford, and Salop,
of which Alveley is one.&nbsp; The parish receives from the
charity money wherewith to distribute fourteen pennyworth of
bread every Sunday, which is given among the poor.</p>
<p><i>James Bowen</i>, by will, dated 1st April, 1715, gave to
the poor of Alveley the sum of &pound;6, to be put forth at
interest by the churchwardens, and the proceeds to be applied to
the purchase of good books, to be distributed to the poor
families of the parish.&nbsp; About thirty years ago this charity
was lost, in consequence of the bankruptcy of the person in whose
hands it was placed.</p>
<p><i>George Garbett</i>, by will, dated 19th June, 1758,
bequeathed &pound;100, to be put out at interest, which was to be
disposed of on the 1st of January every year to such poor persons
of the parish of Alveley as should not receive parochial
relief.</p>
<p><i>Humphrey Dovey</i>, in 1700, left &pound;20, the interest
thereof to be distributed among the poor of the parish in
bread.&nbsp; In respect of which forty-three penny loaves are
distributed on Good Friday, and forty on St. Thomas&rsquo;s
day.</p>
<p><i>Arthur Arden</i> left a piece of land, containing two acres
and a half, the profits of which were to be expended in bell
ropes (when required) for the use of the parish church.&nbsp; At
the time the Charity Commissioners published their report the
land was let at a rent of &pound;6 per annum.&nbsp; It is said
the land was given to the parish clerk on condition that he
should find bell ropes, but the original conveyance, which had
been kept in the church chest, was lost about fifty years ago;
and it appears that for more than 100 years the rents of the land
have been received by the parish clerk for his own use, and he
has provided the bell ropes as they were wanted.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Russell</i>, in 1842, gave the sum of &pound;40, and
directed the interest to be appropriated for the benefit of poor
parishioners.</p>

<h3>ASTLEY ABBOTTS,</h3>
<p>a parish and village in the Chelmarsh division of the
Stottesden Hundred, two miles and a half north from Bridgnorth,
contains 3,137 acres of land, intersected by the Broseley
turnpike road and the Tasley and Linley streams, and is bounded
on the eastern side by the river Severn.&nbsp; 193 acres are in
woods, plantations, and water.&nbsp; The soil in some parts is a
mixture of earth and sand, and in other places a strong
loam.&nbsp; Rateable value &pound;4,023. 1s. 2d.&nbsp; At the
census in 1801 there were 740 inhabitants; 1831, 666; and in
1841, 657.&nbsp; At the latter period there were 139 inhabited
houses.&nbsp; The situation of Astley Abbotts is pleasant and
highly salubrious, and there are several handsome
residences.&nbsp; The farms are mostly of considerable extent,
and by a judicious outlay of capital in draining and other
improvements have been brought to a state of great
productiveness.&nbsp; The principal landowners are Thos. Charlton
Whitmore, Esq.; Lady Tyrwhitt Jones; John Stephens, Esq.; Mr.
John Ward; Miss Pilkington; Mr. John Bowen; Rev. C. Whitmore;
Lord Forester; Mr. John Lee; Sir John Acton, Bart.; Mr. Thomas
Yapp; and George Pritchard, Esq.&nbsp; The former is lord of the
manor.&nbsp; There are also several smaller proprietors.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Church</span>, an ancient fabric neatly
pewed with oak sittings, has a groined roof, resting on hammer
head projections, upon which are carved figures of the
apostles.&nbsp; A neat tablet remembers Sir Tyrwhitt Jones,
Bart., F.R.S. and M.P., who died in 1811.&nbsp; The same tablet
also records the deaths of several other members of the
family.&nbsp; An elegant tablet commemorative of <a
name="page614"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 614</span>Sir Thomas
Jones, Knt., is dated 1782.&nbsp; A memorial of elaborate
workmanship to Francis Billingsley, Esq., of Astley, an officer
in the army of King Charles, is dated 1656.&nbsp; It also records
the deaths of various other members of the Billingsley
family.&nbsp; Upon a garland suspended from the sounding board
hangs a pair of white kid gloves, and from an inscription we
learn that Henry Phillips died in 1707 when presenting himself at
the altar to be married.&nbsp; The lady to whom he was about to
be united survived him but a short period.&nbsp; The reading desk
and pulpit exhibit an exquisite specimen of carved
workmanship.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, enjoyed by
the rector of Stockton; officiating minister, Rev. John Wing,
B.A.&nbsp; The lord of the manor is patron of the living.&nbsp;
The tithes are commuted for &pound;220.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Astley Hall</span>, the elegant mansion of Alfred
Darby, Esq., is delightfully situated near the banks of the river
Severn, and presents a beautiful specimen of the decorative style
of the Elizabethan age.&nbsp; The house was originally built in
1642, but has been greatly enlarged and beautified at subsequent
periods.&nbsp; The pleasure grounds are tastefully laid out, and
the park is richly clothed with sylvan beauty.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Astley Abbotts House</span> is an ancient timbered
mansion, the residence and property of George Pritchard,
Esq.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Albynes</span>, a good house of
modern erection, the residence and property of John Stephens,
Esq., is pleasantly situated in a bold undulating district, and
surrounded with park-like grounds.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Dunvall House</span>, the property and residence of
Mr. John Bowen, is a place of great antiquity, and was formerly
the seat of the Acton family.&nbsp; It is chiefly composed of
massive timber and plaster, and is an interesting specimen of the
domestic architecture of by-gone days.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>&mdash;<i>John Huxley</i>,
<i>Esq.</i>, in the year 1714, gave by his will a rent charge of
20s. per annum, to be distributed among twenty poor widows.&nbsp;
A sum of &pound;20, supposed to have been left by one
<i>Litttehales</i>, was lent to a person named Bache, of
Bridgnorth, and afterwards to William Bourne, a baker, of the
same place, who used to send a monthly supply of bread to the
amount of the interest.&nbsp; Shortly before the Charity
Commissioners published their report Mr. Bourne became bankrupt,
and the parish officers had not applied to prove this debt, from
an idea that they had not the means of substantiating the
claim.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. Catherine Phillips</i>, by will, 1815, gave
to the incumbent and churchwardens of Astley Abbotts the sum of
&pound;300 stock in the three per cent. consols, in trust, to pay
out of the yearly dividends the sum of 20s. among twenty poor
widows on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day, and the remainder to some
proper person for teaching poor children to read and write, and
for bringing them to church every Sunday in an orderly
manner.</p>

Population in 1801, 247; 1831, 260, and in 1841 173.&nbsp; The
principal landowner is the Duke of Cleveland.&nbsp; John W.
Sparrow, Esq., John Hincksman, Esq., and Henry George Mytton,
Esq., are also proprietors.&nbsp; The manor of Aston was formerly
held under the Fitzalans Earls of Arundel, by the family of
Botterels, from whom it received the addition of their name to
distinguish it from the other Astons in the county.&nbsp; In the
48th of Henry III. Thomas Botterel had a grant of a market on
Tuesday, and a fair at Michaelmas, and also the privilege of free
warren.&nbsp; At the time of the commonwealth circular letters
were sent to chose one hundred and four godly men to assist
Cromwell in his government, and for this county the choice fell
upon William Botterell, and Thomas Baker.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St.
Michael, is an ancient structure built of stone, having a square
tower, in which are three bells.&nbsp; The interior contains
nave, chancel, and south aisle, in which is a monument to the
memory of John and Mary Botterel, supposed to have been erected
about the year 1585.&nbsp; The side aisle is separated from the
body of the church by three pointed arches.&nbsp; The church was
enlarged and repaired in the year 1830, when one hundred and
eight free sittings were provided, in addition to twenty formerly
free.&nbsp; The registers of the parish commenced in the year
1559.&nbsp; The living is a rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s

<p>a parish in the Chelmarsh division of the hundred of
Stottesden, six miles S. of Bridgnorth, is pleasantly situated on
the Bridgnorth and Cleobury Mortimer turnpike road.&nbsp; It
contains 1,285 acres of land, the rateable value of which is
&pound;900. 10s.&nbsp; In 1841 there were 29 houses and 149
persons; population in 1801, 320; 1831, 161.&nbsp; The Duke of
Cleveland is the principal landowner.&nbsp; William Lacon Childe,
Esq., and the rector are also proprietors.&nbsp; This place it is
said was anciently called Biligesleague, and that an important
congress was held here in 1055 between King Harold and Griffin
Prince of Wales, in which they engaged to maintain peace and
mutual good will.&nbsp; Dr. Thomas Hyde, the great linguist and
librarian, was born at this place in 1638.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span> is a small structure containing
nave, chancel, and has a turret, in which are two bells.&nbsp;
The accommodation of this church was increased in 1836, by which
means twenty additional sittings were obtained, and in
consequence of a grant from the Incorporated Society fourteen of
that number are declared free and unappropriated for ever.&nbsp;
The living is a rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s book at

<h3>BRIDGNORTH</h3>
<p>is a populous and well built market town and borough, both
corporate and parliamentary, having separate jurisdiction, and
locally situated in the Stottesden hundred, 139 miles N.W. from
London, twenty miles S.E. from Shrewsbury, thirteen <a
name="page616"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 616</span>miles S.W.
from Wolverhampton, and eight miles S.E. from Much Wenlock.&nbsp;
The town is situated on the banks of the Severn which divides it
into two portions called the Upper and Lower towns.&nbsp; The
Upper town is on the western bank of the river, on the sides and
summit of a red sandstone rock which rises to the height of near
two hundred feet above the level of the river.&nbsp; The
appearance of this part of the town is remarkably picturesque,
and the view is very fine, especially from that part where the
remains of the castle stand, where a terrace walk has been laid
out, overlooking the Lower town, the river, and a widely
spreading country.&nbsp; This walk extends 622 yards, and was
much admired by King Charles I. who was at Bridgnorth three times
during the civil wars, and preferred it to all other terraces, in
the kingdom.&nbsp; Persons visiting Bridgnorth universally
consider it highly interesting, and are charmed with the
beautiful scenery it opens to view.&nbsp; The town contains many
good houses and handsome shops in the different branches of the
retail trade, there are also some good family mansions and villa
residences, which are ornamented with pleasure grounds tastefully
laid out.&nbsp; Under the brow of the hill are many rude
dwellings cut out of the sandstone rock, with several caves, over
which the inhabitants have gardens, which gives the whole a very
romantic appearance.&nbsp; The road from the Low town to the High
town winds round the rock, but the nearer approaches for foot
passengers are by several flights of steps, one of which called
the Stoneway-steps formed by pebbles secured by a framing of
ironwork, consists of 179 steps.&nbsp; The town comprises the two
parishes of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Leonard, and at the census
of 1801 had 4,408 inhabitants; 1831, 5,065; and 1841,
5,770.&nbsp; Rateable value of St. Mary&rsquo;s parish,
&pound;7,402. 12s. 8d.&nbsp; Rateable value of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s parish, &pound;7,635. 10s. 11d.&nbsp; The
principal trade of Bridgnorth is an extensive establishment for
the manufacture of carpets and rugs, malting, worsted spinning,
and boat building.&nbsp; The town, however, derives its chief
importance from its situation on the river, and is a thriving
inland port.&nbsp; A large portion of the labouring class obtains
employment in the navigation of the Severn, but the market and
retail trade with the neighbourhood afford the principal source
of profit to the inhabitants.</p>
<p>Bridgnorth is a place of great antiquity; it was originally
called Brugia, or Bruges, and derived its name from a bridge
erected over the Severn here.&nbsp; The first memorable
transaction that we find of this town was in King Alfred&rsquo;s
days, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 894, when the Danes
being driven from Norfolk, were forced to leave their ships and
spend the winter at Brug upon Severn, on the borders of Wales,
where they built a strong fort.&nbsp; Whether the fort was
destroyed by the chance of war we are unable to discover, but it
is stated that Elfled, daughter of King Alfred, repaired both the
town and castle, then fallen to decay.&nbsp; It subsequently
underwent the common vicissitudes of the country, being harassed
both by the Saxons and the Danes, till Roger de Montgomery having
obtained a grant of the earldom of Salop, built a new castle
here.&nbsp; Robert de Belesme, eldest son of the said Roger, in
the time of Henry I. declared for Robert Curthose, and fortified
his castle against the king, but after a siege of three weeks it
was surrendered, and with the rest of his possessions annexed to
the crown.&nbsp; In the 16th of Edward III. the out-liberties of
the castle which anciently were held of the Norman earls of
Shrewsbury by the annual service of ten marks, were incorporated
with the town.&nbsp; The fee of the keeper of this castle in the
time of Elizabeth was &pound;9. 2s. 6d.&nbsp; The castle having
not been a sufficient defence of the town without walls about it,
therefore in the 11th of Henry III. an aid was granted for two
years for the walling of the town, and six years after another
aid was granted for the same purpose.&nbsp; The first charter of
which any knowledge exists is of the 16th of King John, which
grants to the burgesses of Bruges and their heirs, certain
liberties and free customs, and freedom from toll throughout the
kingdom, except within the liberties of London.&nbsp; The
burgesses maintained a suit at law against the Salopians, who
hindered them from bringing raw hides and flannel cloth in their
market, both towns depending on the validity of their charters
which were fully enquired into.&nbsp; In the 10th of Henry III.
the grant of a fair was obtained to be held on St. Luke&rsquo;s
day, which subsequently became remarkable for the sale of hops,
cheese, and walnuts.&nbsp; The burgesses had liberty in <a
name="page617"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 617</span>this reign
of holding pleas in personal actions, and of erecting
fraternities or guilds of tradesmen.&nbsp; In the 33rd of Edward
III. the inhabitants obtained the grant of a fair to be held at
the feast of the Translation of St. Leonard, and for the three
days following.&nbsp; Fairs are now held on the third Thursday in
February, third Tuesday in March, 1st May, third Tuesday in June,
first Tuesday in August, third Tuesday in September, 20th
October, and the first Tuesday after Shrewsbury December
fair.&nbsp; The market is held on Saturday, and well supplied
with butchers&rsquo; meat, butter, poultry, and other provisions
of excellent quality.&nbsp; The corn market is numerously
attended, and business to a considerable extent is usually
transacted.</p>
<p>The old corporation consisted of two bailiffs, a recorder, a
deputy recorder, twenty-four aldermen, forty-eight common
councilmen, two chamberlains, and two bridge masters, with a town
clerk, sergeants at mace, and other officers.&nbsp; The bailiffs
were justices of the peace, and justices of the court of record;
the senior acted as coroner for the borough.&nbsp; The recorder
held his office for life; his deputy whom he appointed was always
a barrister, and the legal adviser of the corporation.&nbsp; The
bailiffs were chosen every year on St. Matthew&rsquo;s day, out
of the twenty-four aldermen, in the following remarkable
manner:&mdash;The court being met, the names of twelve aldermen,
seniors of those then present, being separately written upon
small bits of paper, all of them of the same size and rolled up
close by the town clerk, were thrown into a large purse, which
after being well tossed by the chamberlains was held betwixt them
before the bailiffs, when each bailiff according to seniority
took out a scroll; by these scrolls the callers were fixed, who
immediately mounting the chequer, alternately called the jury out
of such persons as are burgesses, and then presented them to the
court to the number of fourteen; these being all sworn, (neither
to eat nor drink till they, or twelve of them, had made choice of
two fit persons, who have not been bailiffs before for three
years), were locked up until they were agreed, a regulation which
has sometimes occasioned long fasting.&nbsp; At the election in
1793, the jury fasted no less than seventy-four hours.&nbsp; By
the new municipal act, Bridgnorth is governed by a bailiff, or
mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors.&nbsp; A commission
of the peace has been granted, and a court of quarter sessions
and recorder appointed.&nbsp; The following is a list of the
members of parliament, borough magistrates, and corporate body,

<p>The ruins of a <span class="smcap">Castle</span> fortified by
Robert de Belesme, the third Norman earl of Shrewsbury, are still
standing.&nbsp; The edifice was erected on the site of a former
structure, but a portion of the square tower now standing 17
degrees out of its perpendicular is almost the only relic of this
baronial fortress left.&nbsp; A chapel within the walls of the
castle was made collegiate, and had a dean and six
prebendaries.&nbsp; When Robert de Belesme held this castle in
rebellion in 1102, against Henry I., Ralph de Pitchford behaved
himself so valiantly, that the king gave him the little Brugg
near it to hold by the service of finding dry wood for the great
chambers of the castle, against the coming of his
sovereign.&nbsp; A romantic act <a name="page618"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 618</span>of loyalty is related of Hubert de
St. Clare, who with King Henry II. was besieging the castle of
Bridgnorth, and seeing one of the enemy taking aim at his
sovereign, stepped before him and received the arrow in his own
breast, and therewith his death-wound.&nbsp; In the civil wars
the castle was garrisoned for the King, who marched here from
Shrewsbury to meet the parliamentary army; an engagement took
place near to St. Leonard&rsquo;s church wherein the royalists
were defeated, the castle totally demolished, and the collegiate
church so injured that it had to be taken down and rebuilt.&nbsp;
The <span class="smcap">Gates</span> and <span
class="smcap">Walls</span> of the town were thrown down in the
civil wars.&nbsp; The north gate was afterwards rebuilt at the
expense of the corporation, over which is a room now used for the
Blue Coat School.&nbsp; A handsome and substantial stone <span
class="smcap">Bridge</span> crosses the Severn, and stands near
the site of a former bridge erected by the Saxons.&nbsp; A
<i>portion</i> of the Lower town is subject to be flooded by the
Severn overflowing its banks.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Races</span> have been discontinued for several years, but have
been revived during the present year.&nbsp; The race-course is
situate about a mile from Bridgnorth, in the parish of
Tasley.&nbsp; There are <span class="smcap">Billiard
Tables</span> at the Raven Inn, Whitburne street, and the Star
Inn, Underhill street.&nbsp; Mr. Edwards has generously granted
the use of Trap-field for a <span class="smcap">Cricket
Ground</span>.</p>
<p>There is a <span class="smcap">Bowling Green</span> at the
Hundred House Inn, situated about a mile from Bridgnorth; Mr.
George Jarratt is the proprietor.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Baths</span> were established in 1841 upon the
premises of the South Shropshire Infirmary.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Society for the Promotion of Religious and Useful
Knowledge</span> hold their meetings annually in December.&nbsp;
The depository for the <span class="smcap">Christian Knowledge
Society</span> is at Messrs. Wilmot and Brickley&rsquo;s, Market
street.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Mechanics&rsquo;
Institution</span>, situated in High street, is furnished with a
library comprising 366 volumes.&nbsp; A reading room has also
been established, which is furnished with periodicals, and some
of the leading London and provincial journals; Joseph L.
Whatmore, secretary.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Town
Library</span> is situated in Castle Terrace, and contains 3,037
volumes; John Pinkstone is the librarian.&nbsp; The Public
Library in St. Leonard&rsquo;s church-yard contains upwards of
4,000 volumes.&nbsp; There are also Circulating Libraries at Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s and Miss Partridge&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Stamp Office</span> is at Mr.
Southwell&rsquo;s, West Castle street, and the <span
class="smcap">Excise Office</span> at the Castle Inn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Town Hall</span>, situated in the
centre of the market place, is an antique structure, built in
1682, and supported by pillars and arches.&nbsp; The large room
is appropriated to the town&rsquo;s business and magisterial
purposes.&nbsp; The space under the hall is used for the sale of
butter and poultry on the market days.&nbsp; No sessions were
held in the town in 1646 by reason of the war.&nbsp; In this
conflict the high town was burnt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Infirmary</span>, in Listley street,
is a handsome structure salubriously situated, and constructed
with every attention to the convenience and convalescence of the
inmates.&nbsp; This institution was established in 1841, and is
chiefly supported by subscriptions, and a few small benefactions
left by charitable individuals; the Rev. J. Purton is the
treasurer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Water Works</span>.&mdash;The town is
supplied with water raised from the Severn, and forced by
machinery through a four inch main into a tank, situated upon
Castle Walk, which when full is capable of holding about 6,500
gallons.&nbsp; The funds for the support of the works are levied
by a rate upon the inhabitants.&nbsp; These works being
inefficient for the supply of the town, it is proposed to
construct a capacious reservoir near Palmer&rsquo;s Hospital, six
feet above the present tank, and twenty feet above High street,
capable of holding 14,000 gallons, and so to improve the
hydraulic machinery, as to give the inhabitants an abundant
supply of this pure beverage of nature; Mr. Thomas Corser is the
superintendent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Gas Works</span>, situated on the
western banks of the Severn, were established in 1838, by Mr.
Edward, of Wellington.&nbsp; There are two gasometers for the
reception of the luminous vapour, and a charge of 8s. 6d. per
cubic feet is made to the consumer; John Lloyd Whatmore,
manager.</p>

class="smcap">The Police Office</span> is in East Castle street;
Thomas A. Wilmot is the superintendent.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Lockup</span> is in Whitburne street.&nbsp; The
mayor and borough magistrates hold a court every alternate Monday
for the trial of petty offences committed within the
borough.&nbsp; The county magistrates hold quarter sessions and
petty sessions every alternate Saturday, and the borough has
continued to return two members to parliament since the time of
Edward I.&nbsp; The places embraced within the jurisdiction of
this borough are the parishes of St. Mary, St. Leonard, Quatford,
Oldbury, Tasley, and Astley Abbots, and the townships of Quatt,
Jarvis, and Eardington, and the liberty of Romsley.&nbsp; In the

<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> of St. Leonard, an
ancient and venerable edifice, rebuilt in 1448, was nearly
destroyed during the civil wars, but repaired soon after the
restoration.&nbsp; It is built of red sandstone, in the Gothic
style of architecture, and has a massive square tower, crowned
with pinnacles, containing a peal of six bells, a clock, and
sun-dial.&nbsp; The interior consists of nave, side aisles, and
chancel, the latter of which underwent a complete reparation <a
name="page620"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 620</span>a few years
ago.&nbsp; The south compartment is separated from the body of
the church by three arches.&nbsp; The church is neatly pewed with
oak, and in the gallery is a powerful and fine-toned organ.&nbsp;
The roof is supported by a framework of oak, each beam of which
is ornamented by a figure of one of the apostles.&nbsp; The
window at the east end was restored by subscription, and
beautified in memory of the late Thomas Whitmore, Esq., who by
will gave the rectoral tithes of Bridgnorth, due to him as
impropriator to the minister of this church, and also to that of
St. Mary Magdalene.&nbsp; On the south side is a stained glass
memorial window, &ldquo;restored in 1847 in memory of Mr.
Boulton, formerly of the grammar school, by a priest of the
English church, as a poor offering of thankfulness to Almighty
God for many means of grace and good instruction vouchsafed both
in this church and at the adjoining grammar school.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This church had near it a college for the habitation of two
chantry priests, appointed to pray for the rest of the soul of
Thomas &agrave; Beckett, archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; It was
destroyed, with most part of the high town and church, at the
time the parliamentary forces took possession of
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, in the
patronage of Thomas Charlton Whitmore, Esq., and incumbency of
the Rev. George Bellett.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for
&pound;308.&nbsp; The parish of St. Leonard contained at the
census of 1841, 627 houses and 2,997 inhabitants.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> dedicated to St. Mary
Magdalene is a handsome edifice in the Grecian style of
architecture, built in the year 1792, of white freestone, at an
expense of &pound;6,027. 11s. 9d.&nbsp; It has a tower,
surmounted by a cupola, containing six bells, a clock, and four
dials.&nbsp; The interior is spacious and handsome, and on the
western gallery is a fine-toned organ.&nbsp; The altar is of oak,
richly carved.&nbsp; The church is styled in ancient records,
&ldquo;<i>Liberia regia capella</i>;&rdquo; that is, a free
chapel of the kings, made exempt from episcopal jurisdiction by
King John, who personally visited this town on his way to
Worcester.&nbsp; It was made parochial in 4th Edward III.&nbsp;
This church was a free collegiate chapel, founded by William the
Conqueror, consisting of a dean and five prebends.&nbsp; The
living is a perpetual curacy, in the patronage of Thomas Charlton
Whitmore, Esq., and incumbency of the Rev. W. K. Marshall.&nbsp;
The tithes are commuted for &pound;268.&nbsp; There are thirteen
and a half acres of glebe land.&nbsp; The parish of St. Mary
Magdalene in 1841 contained 577 houses, and 2,773
inhabitants.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Baptist Chapel</span>, situated in
West Castle street, is a brick structure, and will accommodate
about 280 persons.&nbsp; It was built in the year 1704.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Catholic and Apostolic Church</span>,
in West Castle street, is a commodious edifice, built of
freestone in the year 1835.&nbsp; The building has Gothic
windows, ornamented with stained glass.&nbsp; The interior has a
beautiful appearance; the altar is of stone, and there are richly
carved oak stalls and desks for the priests.&nbsp; The seats are
all free.&nbsp; &ldquo;The congregation is under the rule and
government of the apostles, being in charge of an angel, who,
with priests, assisted by deacons, fulfil their several duties
clothed with appropriate vestments.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Independent Chapel</span>, built of
brick in the year 1711, will accommodate about 400 hearers.&nbsp;
It is situated on the Stoneway Steps.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel</span>,
situated on St. Mary&rsquo;s Steps, was erected in the year 1832,
and has since been enlarged.&nbsp; It is now capable of seating
250 persons.&nbsp; A Sabbath school is connected with the chapel,
where about seventy children attend.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The National and Infant Schools</span>,
situated on elevated ground in Listley street, were established
in 1820.&nbsp; There is accommodation in these schools for 300
children: 150 boys and 50 girls attend.&nbsp; The schools are
supported by annual subscriptions, donations, charity sermons,
and small weekly payments from the scholars.&nbsp; The income for
the year ending March 25th, 1851, amounted to &pound;228. 14s.
3d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The British School</span>, in West Castle
street, is held in a spacious and convenient room under the
Baptist chapel: it is numerously attended.&nbsp; There is also a
school taught in a room over the Independent chapel, where about
sixty children are instructed.</p>
<p><a name="page621"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 621</span><span
class="smcap">St. Mary&rsquo;s School</span>, situated in the Low
Town, is a commodious building of brick, erected by public
subscriptions in 1847, at a cost of &pound;756.&nbsp; Upwards of
100 children attend the school.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Free Grammar School</span>.&mdash;This
school was founded more than three hundred years ago, by the
bailiffs and burgesses, for the purpose of affording, free of
expense, to &ldquo;<i>all comers</i>,&rdquo; instruction in
literature and good learning, until they shall be capable to be
sent to the universities of Oxford or Cambridge.&nbsp; For the
better maintenance of the school, Sir Rowland Hayward, in 1624,
gave a rent charge of &pound;20 per annum; &pound;4 a year was
left by his son; &pound;2 a year was left by Sir John Hayward for
the usher; and &pound;8 a year, called the king&rsquo;s
allowance, was also paid to the usher out of the audit
money.&nbsp; In 1639, the lease of a house was granted by Sir
William Whitmore, at an annual rent of 8s., for a residence for
the master.&nbsp; In 1687 Sir William Whitmore renewed the lease,
and by a covenant therein, bound his successors to continue the
lease on the same conditions, as long as the school should
continue to be a free school.&nbsp; It appears that the master of
the free school has always received some allowance from the
corporation, which in 1726 amounted to &pound;10; in 1817 it was
increased to &pound;30; and it was further agreed to supply from
the private funds of those members of the corporation who sent
their sons to this school, as much money as, in addition to the
several sources of emolument before particularised, would make up
an annual salary of &pound;100 for the master.&nbsp; For the last
two years the grant from the corporation has been discontinued:
it is hoped, however, the corporate body will see the propriety
of renewing their grant.&nbsp; The various bequests to this
school, and the exhibitions at Christ College, Oxford, will be
found noticed with the following account of the general charities
of Bridgnorth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Edward
Careswell</i>, by will dated 3rd February, 1689, left certain
lands in the counties of Salop and Stafford, in all containing
1,075<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>.
23<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, chargeable with the
maintenance of eighteen scholars in the college of Christ Church,
in Oxford, four of the aforesaid scholars to be chosen from
Shrewsbury Free Grammar School, three from Bridgnorth, four from
Newport, three from Shiffnal, two from Wem, and two out of
Donnington, in the parish of Wroxeter, who were to receive while
undergraduates &pound;18 each for four years, after he should
have commenced bachelor of arts; &pound;21 each for three years,
until he should commence master of arts; and &pound;27 yearly to
each for three years after he should commence master of arts, and
no longer.&nbsp; In the year 1813, a considerable surplus of the
rents and profits having accrued, the sum of &pound;1,500 was
applied to the purchase of the rectoral tithes of the
Walker&rsquo;s Low and Walkham Wood farms: and in 1815 the
further sum of &pound;1,515. 7s. was laid out in the purchase of
26<span class="smcap">a</span>. 0<span class="smcap">r</span>.
38<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land, with a new built brick
and tiled barn in the parish of Quatford.&nbsp; This farm had
previously gained an addition of 36<span class="smcap">a</span>.
1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 14<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
under the Morfe Enclosure Act; and on the Priors Ditton
enclosure, in 1813, an allotment of 10<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span class="smcap">r</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">p</span>. was awarded to the Sydnall Farm.&nbsp;
The tenants of the land respectively hold from year to year, and
the rents are varied from time to time, as circumstances are
found to require.&nbsp; At the time the charity commissioners
published their report, the annual rent was &pound;1,191.
2s.&nbsp; From the surplus rents and profits there remained on
25th January, 1820, the amount of &pound;9,394. 7s. 6d. three per
cent. consols, and in cash the sum of &pound;1,093. 18s. 1d.; the
former sum affording an income of &pound;281. 16s. 7&frac12;d.,
which, with the rents, make the sum of &pound;1,472. 18s.
7&frac12;d. as the total annual income, which is subject to a
charge of &pound;308. 1s. 4d. for repairs, leaving for the
objects of the charity the sum of &pound;1,164. 17s.
3&frac12;d.&nbsp; By a codicil to the will of the aforesaid
Edward Careswell, dated 24th February, 1689, he devised the sum
of &pound;10 to be annually paid to the minister of Bobbington,
in augmentation of his salary, which sum was to be deducted out
of the several allowances of the eighteen scholars, when the same
shall become payable, by an abatement of 11s. 1&frac12;d. out of
each of the said scholars&rsquo; allowance.</p>
<p><i>Arthur Weaver</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, by will, dated 27th
February, 1709, gave to his son Anthony and his heirs the
granary, and garden thereunto adjoining, in Bridgnorth, and <a
name="page622"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 622</span>&pound;112.
12s. 6d. to be disposed of as follows:&mdash;First, he desired
that it should be employed for keeping about 900 bushels of corn,
to be bought when it was 2s. 6d. per bushel and sold when it was
above 4s. per bushel, and that the residue of the building and
garden should be employed towards the charge of looking after the
corn.&nbsp; For perpetuating the stock, he desired that 2s. 6d.
should be reserved out of each bushel sold, the residue to be
given from time to time to the poor housekeepers having three or
more young children of both the parishes of Bridgnorth only, as
also the product of the stock when not laid up in the said
granary, it being found after the testator&rsquo;s death
impossible to comply with those directions, the sum of
&pound;112. 12s. 6d. was placed out at interest and the interest,
as also the rents of the granary, were distributed as directed by
the will.&nbsp; In 1779, by an order, the aforesaid sum was
directed to be invested in the three per cent. consols, and the
interest is now distributed to poor housekeepers.&nbsp; The rents
accruing from these charities are now applied in aid of a free
school, called the Blue Coat School, in which thirty boys are
instructed and clothed, and at the time of their leaving school a
small sum is allowed to each scholar to apprentice him to some
trade.&nbsp; The school is situated over the North Postern
Gate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Almshouses</span>&mdash;The earliest
mention of the almshouses is contained in a document preserved
among the archives of the corporation, which purports to be the
presentment and verdict of a jury, impanelled at Bridgnorth, on
the 2nd of September, in the 6th year of Charles I., under a
commission of charitable uses, by which they presented that
<i>William Swanwicke</i> gave to divers feoffees, on the 2nd of
March, 2nd and 3rd of Philip and Mary, a tenement and three
gardens for the use of the poor almsfolk residing within the
almshouses in Church street of the said town.&nbsp; They further
presented that <i>Henry Taycock</i> gave towards the relief of
the poor almspeople aforesaid a certain close called
Brown&rsquo;s Croft, and seven acres and two selions of land; and
<i>William Sparry</i>, by indenture, dated the 2nd of May, 26th
Elizabeth, gave two acres of ground in Astley Abbotts, for 3,000
years, to the intent that the profits of one acre should redound
to the use of the poor almspeople aforesaid, and the rent of the
other acre to the use of the poor of St. Leonard&rsquo;s
parish.</p>
<p>The sum of &pound;80 was vested by the bailiffs and burgesses
in the year 1709, with other monies, in the purchase of an estate
at Higley, of which we shall give an account when treating of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; In respect of this, an annual sum
of &pound;4 is distributed by the churchwardens of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s among the twelve almswomen, together with 10s.,
which in some of the earlier entries in the parish books is
termed &ldquo;the interest of &pound;10,&rdquo; and in others,
&ldquo;the interest of late Milner&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a common hall order, dated 18th of January, 1768, reciting
that twenty elms, the property of the almshouses, were sold for
&pound;11, it was agreed that the corporation should take the
money, and pay the almswomen 12s. yearly at Christmas for the
same.&nbsp; The corporation likewise pays the sum of 20s. yearly
for the interest of &pound;25, which was left for the use of the
poor people in the almshouses.&nbsp; The inmates have the
interest of &pound;100, left in 1838, by <i>Mr. Milner</i>, and
of a sum of &pound;37. 5s. 6d., the gift of <i>Mrs. Bell</i> in
1832.&nbsp; Each almswoman has 3s. 6d. weekly.&nbsp; They are
appointed by the corporation.</p>
<p><i>Paul Bridgen</i>, by will, dated 24th of February, 1769,
gave to the corporation of Bridgnorth the sum of &pound;24, for
the poor women of the almshouses to have a shilling each paid to
them on Good Fridays, and one upon the second day of March, it
being the interest thereof.</p>
<p><i>Sarah Pardoe</i>, in 1808, left the sum of &pound;100, to
be placed out at interest for the use of the almshouses.&nbsp;
This donation was invested in the purchase of &pound;156. 3s. 3d.
consols, the dividends of which being &pound;4. 12s. per annum,
which sum, after deducting charges, is divided among the twelve
poor women in January and July, in shares of 3s. 10d. each.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Clark</i> left 10s. for a sermon on the 11th day of
January, and three shillings to be given in bread the same
day.</p>
<p><a name="page623"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
623</span><i>William Taylor</i>, by will, dated 6th of February,
1735, directed that every person who should hereafter be an owner
of his two freehold messuages, land, and premises, with the
appurtenances, situated in High street, in the parish of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s, should yearly for ever provide a dinner on the
26th of December, for the poor persons called almshouse-women;
or, in default, he ordered the sum of &pound;10 to be divided
between the aforesaid almswomen, the same to be chargeable yearly
upon the said messuages and premises.</p>
<p><i>Mary Childe</i>, by her will, dated 27th of August, 1817,
and proved in November, 1819, gave the sum of &pound;100, to be
placed at interest on some good security, and to pay the
interest, dividends, and produce thereof, in equal shares at
Christmas, to the almswomen of Bridgnorth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bread Fund</span>.&mdash;The almswomen
also participate in the general distribution of bread from the
parochial fund of St. Leonard&rsquo;s, of which we shall give an
account among the charities of that parish.</p>
<p><i>Walter Wrottesley</i>, by will, proved in 1630, bequeathed
to the poor people of Bridgnorth the sum of &pound;100, to be
disposed of by the magistrates of the town as they should think
fit.&nbsp; It was resolved in 1633 to repair the conduit pipes of
the town with the principal, and that &pound;5 per annum as
interest should be given to the poor of St. Leonard&rsquo;s and
St. Mary&rsquo;s parishes; which sum they now receive.</p>
<p><i>William Pulley</i> bequeathed a house and land, situated in
Beauchamp Roothing, in Essex, on the 20th of December, 1640, to
the inhabitants of Bridgnorth for ever, on condition that they
should give &pound;16 every year to two young men or women who
should stand in need of it; and that those who had it one year
should have it no more for the space of three years after.</p>
<p><i>The Rev. Francis Wheeler</i>, by will, dated 8th of
February, 1686, gave five meadows in St. Mary&rsquo;s parish,
containing 21<span class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 5<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
on condition that the sum of &pound;10 should be given to the
poor of Bridgnorth, as an annuity or rent charge; &pound;10 per
annum for a sermon to be preached by the minister of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s on the feast of St. James.&nbsp; And having
further charged the lands with an annuity of 50s. yearly to the
curate of Masemoor, and 10s. to the poor of Willey, he directed
that if the rent of the premises should be improved, the increase
of the rents should solely redound to the settled public
preachers of Bridgnorth.&nbsp; The premises were let in 1818 for
a rent of &pound;102. 2s. 6d., which, after deducting the rent
charges, left the sum of &pound;44. 11s. 3d. to each of the two
ministers, subject to occasional expenses for repairs.</p>
<p><i>The Spinners&rsquo; Money</i>&mdash;It seems that the sum
of &pound;215 is in the hands of the corporation (which was left
by Mr. Blakeway, Mr. Lamb, and Mr. Elliot, for the use of the
spinners and carders), for which is paid the small sum of
&pound;3. 18s, 4d. yearly, as interest, which is divided among
the poor of the town.&mdash;<i>Bridge Lands</i>: There are
several tenements in Bridgnorth, the rents of which are applied
to the repair of the bridge, but when and by whom left is
unknown.&nbsp; The annual rents amount to &pound;18. 7s. 2d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities of the Upper
Town</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Palmer&rsquo;s
Hospital</span>.&mdash;<i>The Rev. Francis Palmer</i>, by will,
dated 2nd September, 1680, bequeathed the sum of &pound;800, to
be laid out in the purchase of free lands in or near the county
of Salop, of the clear yearly value of &pound;30 per annum; and
he also willed that his executors should cause to be erected an
almshouse containing ten distinct rooms for ten several poor
widows of the Upper Town, such as should frequent the church, and
to allow each of them the sum of &pound;3 per annum, save only
repairs to be deducted.&nbsp; The executors purchased an estate
in Hopton Wafers, containing 111<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 32<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
which was let in 1807, at a rent of &pound;93. 6s. per annum; by
a valuation of premises made when the Charity Commissioners
published their report it was found that the annual value was
&pound;119. 6s. 3d.&nbsp; From sales of timber in 1797 and 1810,
and a donation of &pound;200 in 1803 from the executors of the
late Mr. Hawkins, the sum of &pound;24 is paid to the charity as
interest of the money, in addition to the rent of the land.</p>
<p><a name="page624"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
624</span><i>Mary Elton</i>, by will, dated 24th of September,
1770, bequeathed the sum of &pound;200, upon trust, to apply the
interest for the use and benefit of the ten poor widows of
Palmer&rsquo;s Hospital.&mdash;<i>Richard Adney</i> bequeathed in
1805 the sum of &pound;200, the interest thereof to be divided
among the inhabitants of Palmer&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p><i>William Warter</i> gave the sum of &pound;20 to
Palmer&rsquo;s Hospital, in respect of which 20s. is paid from an
estate at Rudge, which formerly belonged to the donor, on St.
Thomas&rsquo;s day, and distributed among the inmates.</p>
<p><i>Bread Fund</i>.&mdash;The poor women of this charity also
participate in the general distribution of bread in the parish of
St. Leonard&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Low Town</span>.&mdash;<i>Sir Robert
Lee</i>, <i>Knt.</i>, in 1635, bequeathed &pound;100, to be
applied in the purchase of land, the rents and profits thereof to
be given for the use of the poor residing in the Low Town of
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; The money was applied in the purchase of a
close containing about five acres of ground, situated in Oldbury
Lordship, the annual rent of which amounts to about &pound;21,
which is distributed as the donor directed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s</span>.&mdash;<i>Henry Bourne</i> bequeathed in
1693 the sum of &pound;50, the interest thereof to be given away
to the poor of the parish in bread every Sunday, as the
churchwardens and overseers should think fit.&mdash;<i>Edward
Jackson</i>, who died in 1709, gave the sum of &pound;100, the
interest of which was to be given to the poor in bread every
first Sunday in the month.&nbsp; In the year 1709 the bailiffs
and burgesses of Bridgnorth purchased an estate at Highley for
the sum of &pound;390, which was made up of the following
sums:&mdash;&pound;50 of Henry Bourne&rsquo;s legacy, &pound;100
of Edward Jackson&rsquo;s charity, &pound;50 of John Lem&rsquo;s
legacy, the interest of which was left for the minister of the
parish, together with a further sum of &pound;10, said to be
given for putting out apprentices, &pound;80 of the almshouse
money, and the residue, &pound;110, was money belonging to the
parish.&nbsp; This estate consists of 33<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 20<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, which produced in 1820 the sum
of &pound;70. 16s. 9&frac12;d., and after payment of &pound;4.
10s. to the almspeople, has formed the basis of a general bread
fund.</p>
<p><i>John Bennett</i>, by will, dated 18th January, 1732, gave
an annual rent charge of &pound;5, clear of all reduction, to be
paid out of his estate at Bobbington, to be laid out in bread and
given to such poor as attended church on the days of Wednesday
and Friday.&nbsp; He also gave 20s. yearly to the minister of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s for a sermon to be preached every 10th day of
October.&nbsp; The &pound;5 for bread forms one of the items in
the general distribution.</p>
<p><i>John Guest</i>, by will, dated 15th of December, 1773, gave
to the bailiffs and burgesses of Bridgnorth for the time being
the sum of &pound;200, to be put out at interest, and he directed
that the interest of &pound;50, part of the said legacy, should
be laid out in bread and distributed every 9th day of January, or
the Sunday following, at each of the parish churches of
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; This legacy was invested in the three per cent.
consols, and produces the annual sum of &pound;7. 17s. 6d., of
which the sum of &pound;1 is annually paid to the parish of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s, and forms part of the general bread fund, and
&pound;1 to the parish of St. Mary.&mdash;<i>John Guest</i>, the
younger, by will, dated 10th December, 1780, gave &pound;20 to
the two parishes of Bridgnorth, in trust, to apply the interest
annually for the use of the poor, to be distributed in bread.</p>
<p><i>William Guest</i>, by will, dated 21st June, 1811,
bequeathed &pound;400, upon trust, to apply the interest thereof
in the purchase of bread, to be distributed among the industrious
poor of the parish.</p>
<p><i>Bread Fund</i>.&mdash;A general distribution of bread is
made every Sunday in the year by the churchwardens to such
objects as appear to be most in need, from the charities of
Wheeler, Bennett, John Guest, John Guest, jun., and William
Guest, which in all amounts to &pound;96. 19s. 10&frac12;d.</p>
<p><i>Edward Guest</i>, by will, dated 13th March, 1797,
bequeathed the sum of &pound;300, upon trust, to place out the
same at interest, and of the profits thereof to pay one-third
part to the minister of the church of St. Leonard, and one-third
part to the minister of St. Mary&rsquo;s, and he gave to the
churchwardens and overseers of the poor of each of the said <a
name="page625"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 625</span>parishes
&pound;50, to be by them placed out at interest, and the
dividends distributed in bread at Christmas, to the poor of the
said parishes.</p>
<p>The &pound;2. 10s. which the parish of St. Leonard&rsquo;s
receives on account of Wrottesley&rsquo;s charity, as stated in
the report of the borough, has been hitherto improperly applied
in aid of the poor&rsquo;s rates.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Law</i>, by will, bequeathed the sum of &pound;40,
upon trust, to place the same out at interest, or purchase land
with it, and yearly to buy as much cloth or linsey woolsey as the
interest or rent would buy, and have the same made into ten
women&rsquo;s petticoats, and to give the same away at Christmas
to ten poor widows, four of whom should be of the parish of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s and six of the parish of St. Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
The benefactions to the minister, amounting to the sum of
&pound;65. 11s. 3d. annually, have been noticed in the preceding
pages.</p>
<p><i>Mary Elton</i>, whose bequest to Palmer&rsquo;s Hospital
has been already mentioned, further gave the sum of &pound;100
towards augmenting the income of the minister of this
parish.&nbsp; There is reason to believe that this sum formed
part of a sum of &pound;200, which the Rev. Thos. Littleton
appears to have deposited in the year 1775 with the
Governor&rsquo;s of Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty, the remaining
&pound;100 being probably a benefaction of his own.&nbsp; This
sum, with a like one advanced by the governors, was applied to
the purchase of certain premises, containing, by estimation,
about nine acres, in the parish of Eye, in Herefordshire.</p>
<p><i>The Earl of Thanet</i> left a legacy of &pound;200 in the
year 1776, for the augmentation of the living of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; The Governors of Queen Anne&rsquo;s
bounty having added a like sum, the amount was applied in 1777 to
the purchase of certain premises at Tenbury, in Worcestershire,
containing about ten acres of land, which produces a sum of
&pound;15 annually.</p>
<p>The rents of two houses and a garden have been long applied to
the repairs of the church, but from what source they were derived
is unknown.&nbsp; The annual rents amount to &pound;25. 10s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities of St. Mary&rsquo;s
Parish</span>.&mdash;<i>The Rev. David Llewellin</i>, by his
will, dated 25th of April, 1794, gave the sum of &pound;50, on
trust, to the minister, churchwardens, and overseers of the
parish of St. Mary&rsquo;s, to place the same out at interest, on
good security, and to apply the interest thereof to the use of
the poor, in such manner as they should direct.</p>
<p><i>Eleanor Church</i>, by will, dated 1798, gave the sum of
&pound;20, the interest thereof to be distributed in bread the
first Sunday after the 26th of May.&nbsp; <i>John Guest</i>
bequeathed a legacy of &pound;20 to this parish, which is
mentioned in our report of St. Leonard&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp;
<i>Sarah Medlicott</i> gave the sum of &pound;10 in the year
1780, the interest thereof to be laid out in sixpenny loaves, and
given to twenty poor housekeepers of this parish, on every 14th
day of February for ever.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Bread
Fund</span>.&mdash;There is a general distribution of bread
weekly, amounting in the whole to &pound;10. 8s. per year.&nbsp;
The distribution in September, 1819, appeared to have settled to
the amount of four shillings worth of bread weekly, which was far
short of the amount of the several charities for which the
charity trustees were accountable.&nbsp; <i>Richard Goodden</i>,
in 1806, assigned four pews in the church of St. Mary Magdalene
to the minister and churchwardens, on trust, to pay and
distribute the rents among poor persons not receiving parochial
relief, in sums of not more than 5s. each.&nbsp; The rents amount
to &pound;3. 18s. annually.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Law&rsquo;s Charity</i>; the particulars of which (the
parish of St. Mary&rsquo;s is entitled to six-tenths) have been
given in the report of St. Leonard&rsquo;s parish.</p>
<p><i>Paul Bridgen</i>, by will, dated 1763, gave &pound;10 to
this parish to purchase a pew, or part of a pew, in the church,
from the rent of which 5s. was to be given to the minister for
preaching a sermon on Good Friday, and one shilling to the clerk
to toll the bell on the said day, and the remainder to be given
to the poor.&nbsp; The benefactions to the minister, amounting to
&pound;49. 1s. 3d., have been noticed in the preceding
pages.&nbsp; <i>William Hand</i>, by will, in 1706, bequeathed to
the minister of this parish and his successors, for ever, a
messuage, which is let to weekly tenants at 2s. 6d. per week,
which sum the minister now <a name="page626"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 626</span>receives.&nbsp; <i>Bridget
Stackhouse</i>, by will, in 1756, gave the sum of &pound;131 to
the minister of the parish of St. Mary Magdalene and his
successors, for ever.&nbsp; This legacy was invested in the
purchase of &pound;145 South Sea annuities, the dividends of
which, amounting to &pound;4. 7s. per annum are duly received by
the minister.</p>
<p>It appears that in the year 1811 and 1812 the Governors of
Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty agreed to augment the curacy of St.
Mary&rsquo;s with five several sums of &pound;200 each, out of
grants made to them by parliament, and that, in the year 1816,
they agreed further to augment the same with the sum of
&pound;300 out of the said grants, in conjunction with <i>Thomas
Whitmore</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, the patron, who gave the sum of
&pound;200, and paid the same to the treasurer of the said
governors for the purpose of such augmentation, which said
several sums, amounting together to the sum of &pound;1,500, were
ordered by the said governors to be laid out in the purchase of
lands, tithes, or other hereditaments, to be settled for the
perpetual augmentation of the curacy of the said parish.&nbsp;
The sum of &pound;1,150 was laid out in 1816 in the purchase of a
dwelling-house, with appurtenances thereto, situated in
Bridgnorth, together with a pew in the parish church of the said
parish.&nbsp; The minister also receives the sum of &pound;14, as
interest on &pound;350 (the residue of the said &pound;1,500),
which remains on their hands applicable to a further
purchase.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Milner</i>, by will, dated 1837, bequeathed
&pound;150, the interest thereof, to be distributed in bread on
the first Sunday in every month, after divine service, to the
poor of this parish.&nbsp; He also gave the sum of &pound;100,
the interest thereof to be applied towards clothing and educating
boys of the Blue Coat School, and the sum of &pound;100, the
interest to be applied to the benefit of the poor widows of the
almshouse of Bridgnorth.</p>

Leland, who observes, &ldquo;Kainsham or Kensham Castle, clene
down, stood within two miles of Ludloe, on a hill
top.&rdquo;&nbsp; The place is now known by the name of Castle
Fields, in which is a deep and wide entrenchment.&nbsp; Tradition

the vicar of the parish, &pound;34. 10s. to the Earl of Craven,

<p>The name of Cleobury Mortimer is said to be derived from its
situation in a district abounding with clay, and from the Saxon
word <i>Byrig</i>, a town, and the adjunct by which it is
distinguished from North Cleobury is obtained from its ancient
possessor, Ralph de Mortimer, who held it at the time of the
general survey.&nbsp; The town principally consists of one long
street extending from east to west, and contains several family
mansions and good shops, in all the different branches of the
retail trade.&nbsp; The labouring population are chiefly engaged
in agricultural pursuits.&nbsp; There were formerly extensive
ironworks in the vicinity, but these have now disappeared.&nbsp;
There are two paper mills in the adjoining parish of Neen Savage,
carried on by Mr. T. L. Hall.&nbsp; The Clee Hill collieries,
about three miles west of the town, have of late been little
wrought, though they contain extensive fields of good coal,
ironstone, and limestone.&nbsp; This town is generally thought to
have <a name="page639"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
639</span>been the birth place of Robert Langlande, author of the
&ldquo;Vision of Pierce the Ploughman,&rdquo; which was published
in the year 1369.&nbsp; A strong castle which formerly stood in
this place was entirely destroyed in the wars between Henry II.
and his rebellious barons; it was built by Hugh de Mortimer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to the Virgin
Mary, is an ancient and venerable structure, built of rubble
stone, probably about the 14th century.&nbsp; Hugh de Mortimer
settled this church for part of the endowment of the Abbey of
Wigmore, about the time of Henry II.&nbsp; The square tower,
containing a peal of six musical bells, a clock, and two dials,
is surmounted by an octagonal spire of wood painted white.&nbsp;
The interior consists of nave, chancel, and side aisles, the
latter is separated from the nave by five pointed arches on each
side.&nbsp; The chancel is separated from the body of the church
by a pointed arch.&nbsp; The western gallery contains a
fine-toned organ, built by subscriptions about seven years ago,
at a cost of &pound;250.&nbsp; On the south side is a stained
glass window, with the representation of Christ and the emblems
of the crucifixion, and underneath are the words, &ldquo;He shall
feed his flock like a shepherd.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the north side is
a beautiful stained glass window in memory of Mary Ann, the wife
of John Lynn Priest; and also a stained glass window containing
figures of St. Anne and St. Mary the Virgin, erected in memory of
Ann Golderby, who died in 1849.&nbsp; There are several marble
tablets and tombs within the church, to the memory of deceased
members of the various families in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
Within the entrance of the porch is the following epitaph to the
memory of Honor Evans.</p>
<blockquote><p>My days, alas! my mortal days, were short and
wretched too:<br />
Evil and few, the patriarch says, and well the patriarch knew<br
/>
That death, like overflowing stream, sweeps all away;
life&rsquo;s but a dream,<br />
An empty tale, a morning flower, cut down and withered in an
hour.<br />
Remember, Lord, man&rsquo;s mortal state; how frail is life, how
short the date,<br />
Where is the man that draws his breath, safe from disease, secure
from death,<br />
For man, weak man is born to die, made up of guilt and vanity.<br
/>
Thy dreadful sentence, Lord, is just; return ye sinners to your
dust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The living of the church is a vicarage, valued in the
king&rsquo;s books at &pound;12. 10s. 10d., in the patronage of
William Lacon Childe, Esq., and incumbency of the Rev. Edward
George Childe, M.A.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodists</span> have a
small chapel in High street, built of brick.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Roman Catholics</span> have also a chapel near
Mawsley Hall, in this parish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Free School</span> was founded and
endowed by Sir Lacon William Childe, knt., in the year 1714, for
the education of the youth of Cleobury Mortimer; for which
purpose he gave by will, dated 28th of October, 1714, all his
personal estate, undisposed of, to be put out at interest or to
be invested in land for the maintenance of a master, to whom he
gave &pound;30 for ever to teach and instruct the children of the
parish.&nbsp; By an order of the court of exchequer, dated 19th
of June, 1735, it was ordered that &pound;200 should be laid out
in the building or purchasing a school and schoolhouse, and that
the residue of the trust money should be laid out in the purchase
of lands, the rents and profits thereof to be applied to the
payment of &pound;30 a year to the schoolmaster, buying English
books for the scholars, repairing the school and schoolhouse, and
putting out six or more poor children of the parish to husbandry,
as the trustees should think fit.&nbsp; By a further order it was
directed that the securities should be called in, and the money
invested in the South Sea Annuities, which produced in 1742 the
sum of &pound;2,475. 6s. which with an outstanding mortgage of
&pound;100 constituted the whole of the testator&rsquo;s personal
estate.&nbsp; In 1751, the sum of &pound;2,700 was expended in
the purchase of 348<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 36<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
in the parish of Cleobury Mortimer, which is now let at a yearly
rent of &pound;343.&nbsp; There is also funded property
consisting of &pound;1,700 south sea annuities; &pound;1,600
three per cent. consols; and a sum of &pound;600 composed of
surplus income, and &pound;198. 16s. received for return of
property tax.&nbsp; Of this fund &pound;1000 three per cents were
bequeathed to the trustees in 1810 by Mr. <a
name="page640"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 640</span>John
Winwood, of Bristol, towards paying an usher to assist in
teaching.&nbsp; The interest of these funds with the rents of
land beforementioned amount to the sum of &pound;463. 1s. 5d. per
annum.&nbsp; Upwards of 160 children are now educated in the
school, of whom twelve boys and twelve girls are annually
clothed, and a fee is given yearly for the apprenticing of six or
more poor scholars to some mechanical or agricultural
pursuit.&nbsp; The head master is appointed by William Lacon
Childe, Esq., of Kinlet, as representative of the founder, and
receives &pound;60 per annum, besides other perquisites;
especially an allowance of 30s. per head for copy books,

and the bells were melted and fell to the bottom of the tower,
and but for the exertions of the surrounding inhabitants, the
whole edifice would soon have been in ruins.&nbsp; There are
seven acres of glebe land in the parish.&nbsp; The Lord
Chancellor is patron of the living; and the Rev. Charles R.
Somers Cocks, M.A., is the vicar.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Richard
Edwards</i>, by will, gave the sum of &pound;400, in trust, that
the same should be laid out in land, and the rents and profits
thereof paid to some good schoolmaster to teach twenty poor boys
of the parish of Neen Savage.&nbsp; In 1732 the sum of &pound;285
was applied in the purchase of 17 acres of land in Stottesden
parish, which is now let at a rent of &pound;35.&nbsp; The
remainder of the money was placed out at interest until some
opportunity may offer of making an advantageous purchase in
land.</p>
<p><i>Richard Hinckesman</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, by will, dated 1780,
charged certain lands in this parish with the payment of 6s. 8d.

<h3>OLDBURY</h3>
<p>is a parish and village in the Chelmarsh division of the
Stottesden hundred, situated about a mile S.S.W. from
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; The village is on a gentle eminence, and
contains some respectable family residences, and is surrounded by
scenery of the most picturesque and romantic character.&nbsp; The
parish comprises upwards of 1,400 acres of land, and is bounded
on the east by the River Severn, and intersected by the
Bridgnorth, Ludlow, and Cleobury Mortimer turnpike roads.&nbsp;
At the census in 1801 there were 107 inhabitants; 1831, 126; and
in 1841, 28 houses, and a population of 142 souls.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Church</span> is a plain structure, dedicated
St. Nicholas, consisting of nave and chancel, with a tower partly
composed of wood.&nbsp; The interior is neatly pewed, and the
nave is separated from the chancel by a carved oak screen.&nbsp;
The Rev. Joseph Woolley, rector of this place 51 years, is
remembered on a neat tablet dated 1728.&nbsp; There are also
tablets to members of the families of Dethic, Beech, Hincksman,
and others.&nbsp; The living is a rectory, rated in the

parish.&nbsp; The time of this bequest is not mentioned; but in
April, 1770, it appears that the principal and interest then
amounted to &pound;10.&nbsp; No application of this legacy seems
to have been made to the use of the poor for a period of upwards
of fifty years.&nbsp; About thirty years ago the principal and
interest were paid over by Mr. Thomas Farmer, and invested in the
stock; the money so invested produced a sum of &pound;57. 12s.
stock in the three per cent. consols; the dividends of which are
yearly distributed among the poor.</p>
<p>The <i>Rev. Thomas Littleton</i>, by his will, dated 17th
September, 1792, gave to the minister and churchwardens or
Oldbury the sum of &pound;10, upon trust, to pay the interest
among the poor who frequent the service of the church.&nbsp; The
personal property of Mr. Littleton passed into the hands of his
executor, Richard Green, and eventually into those of his
brother, Jonathan Green, who became embarrassed in his
circumstances.&nbsp; The property had been sold when the Charity
Report was published, and it was expected that this, with other
claims, would soon be liquidated.</p>

<h3>QUATFORD,</h3>
<p>a small parish and village on the banks of the river Severn,
about a mile and a half south from Bridgnorth, derives its name
from <i>Coed</i> and <i>Forda</i> (British), signifying the Wood
at the Ford&mdash;originally within the Forest of Morfe.&nbsp;
The parish contains 1,773 acres of land, and includes the
lordships of Hay and Eardington, which are situated on the
opposite side of the river Severn.&nbsp; The parish in 1801
contained 417 inhabitants; 1831, 492; 1841, 553.&nbsp; Rateable
value, &pound;3,586, 18s. 3d.&nbsp; The township of Quatford
comprises 514 acres of land, and in 1841 had 44 houses and a
population of 204 souls.&nbsp; The manor belongs to the
corporation of Bridgnorth, and the mayor for the time being is
lord of the manor.&nbsp; John Smalman, Esq., is the principal
landowner; George Pritchard, Esq., W. W. Whitmore, Esq., Henry
Vickers, Esq., Mary Jones, Mr. Thomas Hudson, Lord Sudeley, Mr.
William Hughes, Mr. Thursfield, and others, are also
proprietors.&nbsp; In this township stands the castellated
residence of John Smalman, Esq., J.P., called <span
class="smcap">Quatford Castle</span>.&nbsp; It stands within
sight of the rock where stood the castle erected by Ethelfleda
Countess of Mercia (the wife of Ethelred, the first Earl Palatine
of Mercia), prior to the year 919.&nbsp; Mr. Smalman is descended
from an ancient family long seated at Wilderhope Hall, in the
parish of Rushbury.&nbsp; The castle is built on a prominent
hill, surrounded by plantations overlooking the beautiful river
Severn for several miles, and only approached by an artificial
road on its eastern side.&nbsp; This enchanting spot, from its
varied views and pleasurable walks, is the constant attraction of
families resident in the town and neighbourhood of Bridgnorth,
who are welcomed by its liberal and much respected
proprietor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, a venerable structure,
dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, has a square tower, surmounted
with pinnacles, and contains three bells.&nbsp; The interior of
the church has a handsome appearance; the altar is elaborately
carved, and the floor of the chancel is covered with encaustic
tiles.&nbsp; There are several neat monumental tablets, one of
which remembers Thomas Crump, who died in 1718; another is
erected to the memory of Joseph Corbet, Esq., who died in
1790.&nbsp; The living is a perpetual curacy, in the patronage <a
name="page653"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 653</span>of Lord
Sudeley, and enjoyed by the Rev. George Leigh Wasey, M.A.&nbsp;
Mr. Cox has the following account of Quatford:&mdash;&ldquo;The
manor of Quatford, belonging to Roger de Montgomery, Earl of
Shrewsbury, he built a church here, upon this occasion: Adaliza,
his wife, coming out of Normandy, there happened so great a storm
at sea that nothing but shipwreck was expected by the mariners;
but her chaplain being wearied with much watching, fell fast
asleep, and as he lay at rest a venerable matron appeared to him,
and said: &lsquo;If your lady will make a vow to build a church
to St. Mary Magdalene, in the place where she first meets the
earl, her husband, in England, she shall be preserved from the
danger of this tempest.&rsquo;&nbsp; This vision being told his
lady, she presently vowed accordingly, and got safe to shore;
from whence, going towards her husband at Shrewsbury, she met him
in this place a hunting, and telling him the vision, he willingly
fulfilled her vow, and built this church at Quatford, and
dedicated it to St. Mary Magdalene, endowed it with ample
possessions, and gave it to his collegiate chapel, in the Castle
of Bridgnorth.&nbsp; Robert de Belesme, his eldest son, coming to
his father&rsquo;s inheritance in England (by the death of his
younger brother, Hugh), removed from this town of
Quatford,&mdash;but whither, we find not.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodists</span> have a
small chapel in the village.&nbsp; There is also a <span
class="smcap">School</span> here, a decorated structure, built in
the year 1847, by subscription; about thirty children
attend.&nbsp; A <span class="smcap">Library</span> for the use of
the parish is kept in the church vestry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>John
Corfield</i>, in 1718, directed six twopenny loaves to be
distributed the first Sunday in every month in the year.&nbsp;
This annuity is paid out of land in Stottesden.&nbsp; <i>Arthur
Weaver</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, in 1709, bequeathed out of the several
tithes of Morville, Aston Eyre, and Quatford, to the curates of
each yearly; the bequest to the curate of Quatford being
&pound;3. 13s. 4d.</p>
<p>It appears that in the years 1767 and 1769, <i>Arthur
Weaver</i> granted two rent charges of &pound;7 each, towards the
augmentation of this curacy, and that the Governors of Queen
Ann&rsquo;s Bounty, in conjunction with the said Isaac Weaver,
agreed to augment the curacy with two several sums of &pound;200
each, having previously agreed to augment the same with a like
sum of &pound;200 by lot.&nbsp; In pursuance of this agreement,
in the year 1784, the sum of &pound;600 was laid out in the
purchase of a certain messuage and about seven acres of land,
situated at Eardington, which were conveyed to the then curate,
to hold to him and his successors for ever.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Church Lands</span>.&mdash;The following
premises have been appropriated to the repairs and uses of the
church for a long period, but from what source they were
originally derived we have been unable to discover:&mdash;A
parcel of land, called Paradise, containing four acres and
three-quarters, producing &pound;10 per annum.&nbsp; A house and
garden let for 10s. a-year, also rendering the service of rowing
over the parishioners at all times free to the parish church on
the other side of the river.&nbsp; There are also several other
plots of land, comprising upwards of 14 acres, which, with the
above sums, produce an annual rent of &pound;20. 1s. 11d.&nbsp;
In the year 1810, timber was sold from the church land for
&pound;100. 12s. 6d., part of which was laid out for a new boat,
and there remained a sum of &pound;70 in the Bridgnorth Bank.</p>
<p><i>William Nicholls</i>, in 1846, bequeathed &pound;150 to the
minister of Quatford, upon trust, to dispose of the interest
thereof among the most deserving poor of the parish.</p>
<p>The sum of &pound;20, left by <i>Thomas Spencer</i> in 1722,
for the benefit of the curate of Quatford, and &pound;10, left by
<i>Elizabeth Oldburg</i> in 1730, have long been lost.</p>

<h3>QUATT,</h3>
<p>an extensive parish, anciently within the forest of Morfe, is
intersected by the Bridgnorth and Kidderminster turnpike road,
and bounded on the western side by the river Severn, which is
crossed at several places by ferry boats.&nbsp; The parish
comprehends the hamlets of Quatt Malvern, Quatt Jarvis, Mose,
Wooton, and Dudmaston, and contains 2,674<span

demesne and grounds of Dudmaston Hall.&nbsp; The soil is for the
most part highly fertile.&nbsp; Rateable value, &pound;3,514. 4s.
5d.&nbsp; Population in 1801, 300; 1831, 328; 1841, 365; part of
the population is included within the limits of the borough of
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; The township of Quatt Malvern at the census of
1841 is returned as containing 29 houses and 141
inhabitants.&nbsp; The tithes are commuted for &pound;415. 9s.
8d.&nbsp; Thomas Charlton Whitmore, Esq., M.P., is the principal
landowner and lord of the manor; John Sing, Esq., Thomas Bowen,
and others, are also freeholders.&nbsp; The village of Quatt is
scattered, but pleasantly situated, four miles S.E. from
Bridgnorth; it contains some good residences, and the surrounding
country is beautifully picturesque and romantic.&nbsp; In
Leland&rsquo;s time there were to be seen here the ruins of the
manor house of Robert de Montgomery.&nbsp; About four miles from
Quatt Malvern are the remains of a Roman camp called <span
class="smcap">The Walls</span>.&nbsp; The form of it is nearly
quadrangular, and there have been four gates into it; one in the
middle of the north front, another in the middle of the west, a
third in the south-east, and a fourth at the north-east
corner.&nbsp; The odd position of the two last take advantage of
declivities in the rock.&nbsp; Besides these a sloping way is cut
through the bank, and down the rock in the middle of the south
face, to the water.&nbsp; The west side has been <a
name="page655"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 655</span>doubly
fortified with a deep trench cut out of the solid rock between
two ramparts.&nbsp; To the north it has only one bank.&nbsp; It
embraces an area of more than twenty acres, but no coins or
antiquities have been found there.&nbsp; Not far from the Severn
an ancient sword was discovered, differing in form and metal to
any hitherto found in Great Britain.&nbsp; Similar have been
found in Ireland.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span> is a venerable fabric,
dedicated to St. Andrew, partly composed of free stone, and
partly of brick.&nbsp; It consists of nave, chancel, side chapel,
and north aisle, the latter separated from the nave by three
arches resting on octagonal pillars; the tower contains four
bells.&nbsp; The pulpit and reading desk are beautifully carved,
and dated 1629.&nbsp; The font is very ancient, and there is a
gallery at the west end, upon which is placed an organ.&nbsp; The
altar is of oak, exquisitely carved.&nbsp; On the floor is a
remarkable inscription, with some curious tracery, dated 1387 and
1495.&nbsp; On a pillar are remembered some of the ancient family
of Wolryches.&nbsp; In the side chapel is a black marble tomb in
memory of Sir Francis Wolryche, who died in 1668, near to which
is an elaborate monumental tomb with figures in black marble, in
bold relief set in a block of alabaster.&nbsp; There is also a
fine figure in alabaster, exquisitely carved, in memory of Dame
Marie Wolryche, dated 1628.&nbsp; Another tomb of fine
workmanship has the figures of a knight and his lady, and
remembers Francis Wolryche, Esq., and Margaret, his wife, and is
dated 1614.&nbsp; There are also some neat tablets in the church
which our limits will not allow us to notice in detail.&nbsp; The
living is a rectory valued in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;14.
15s., now returned at &pound;415. 4s. 8d., in the patronage of W.
W. Whitmore, Esq., and incumbency of the Rev. Edmund Carr,
M.A.&nbsp; The rectory is a handsome and spacious residence
situated near the church.&nbsp; On rebuilding the church of Quatt
in 1763 were found a number of figures painted on the walls,
representing the Seven Charities and the Day of Judgment; and on
a piece of vellum nailed to an oak board the figure of our
Saviour rising from the sepulchre, underneath the figure were the
following lines:&mdash;&ldquo;Saynt Gregory and other popes and
byshops grantes sex and twenty thousand zere of pardonz thirtti
dayes to alle that saies devoutlye knelyng afor yis is ymage fife
paternosters, fife aves, and a cred.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The South Eastern Shropshire District
School</span> has been established for the reception of children
belonging to the several unions of Bridgnorth, Cleobury Mortimer,
Madeley, and Seisdon.&nbsp; The object of the institution is not
only to give a sound healthy education, but so to improve both
the physical and mental powers as shall break the thread of
pauperism, and enable this hitherto unhappy class to establish
themselves in after life as independent labourers.&nbsp; The
experiment has proved most satisfactory, and even more successful
than was expected, not only in giving a good healthy education
combined with labour to the children, but yielding such a return
in money as altogether prevented any additional cost to the
ratepayers, and even paid a portion of the former expenses.&nbsp;
The actual profits of the four acres of land cultivated having
amounted to between &pound;60 and &pound;70 per annum.&nbsp; The
question of profit, though of importance, is trifling when
compared with the benefits derived by the children, who are here
removed from scenes of inferiority and degradation and brought up
in habits of industry, and a knowledge of gardening combined with
the inculcation of honest principles and religious knowledge, are
blessings of incalculable amount.&nbsp; The house is capable of
accommodating 170 children, and the boys are employed in the
cultivation of the land, in the management of cows, pigs, and a
pony; the girls are employed in the house and dairy work.&nbsp;
Henry Garland is the governor, and Mrs. Garland matron.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dudmaston Hall</span>, the seat and
property of W. W. Whitmore, Esq., J.P., is a handsome brick
mansion, situated near the Bewdley and Bridgnorth turnpike
road.&nbsp; It stands in an extensive and richly wooded park, and
is beautified with tasteful pleasure grounds and choice
shrubs.&nbsp; Dudmaston is a manor within the manor of Quatt, and
was in early times the residence of Dudmastons, from whom it
passed in marriage to the Wolryches, and they devised it to their
maternal relation, William Whitmore, Esq., whose descendant now
inherits the estate and mansion.</p>
<p><a name="page656"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 656</span><span
class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;By an indenture, dated
September 17th, 1687, the churchwardens and two parishioners of
this parish devised, for a term of 99 years, to Richard Gough, a
piece of land in St. Leonard&rsquo;s parish, in consideration
that the said Richard Gough should, within five years, erect
thereon a bay of building with brick and stone; and also should
pay, during the term, the annual rent of five shillings, for the
benefit of the poor of Quatt.&nbsp; It does not appear to what
source the parish was indebted for this land, but in an old
corporation book belonging to the corporation of Bridgnorth,
there is an entry, purporting to be an extract from the will of
<i>Thomas Dovey</i>, dated 13th of February, 1601, whereby he
gave to the parish of Quatt &pound;5 for the use of the poor for
ever.&nbsp; In 1788, the former lease having expired, a new lease
of the premises was granted for the like term, and at the same
rent; the sum of &pound;12 being paid as a fine for renewal.</p>
<p>This parish appears also to have enjoyed for many years the
property of a house and land, in the parish of Worfield, of the
origin of which we have not been able to discover any
trace.&nbsp; The earliest notice that we find of it is in the
year 1759, when it appears in the occupation of a tenant at the
rent of &pound;2. 10s. per annum.&nbsp; In 1802 the premises were
sold for &pound;110, and the amount was placed in the bank of

17s. 1d.&nbsp; The Duke of Cleveland is lord of the manor, and a
considerable landowner.&nbsp; The farms in the parish are
generally large, excepting on the south-western side, adjoining
the Clee Hill, where are collieries and ironstone mines, which
give employment to a number of the labouring population, but the
principal part are engaged in agricultural pursuits.&nbsp; There
is a considerable portion of clayey soil in the parish, other
parts are of a more light and sandy nature, and in some places a
fertile loam prevails.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Stottesden</span> is a pleasant village, 13 miles
north-east by east of Ludlow, five miles north of Cleobury
Mortimer, and eight miles south-west by south of
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; The township contains 987<span

class="smcap">p</span>. of land, the rateable value of which is
&pound;1,216. 4s. 7d.; and at the census of 1841 there were 53

township are Mrs. Oldbury; Rev. Charles J. Maddison; Rev. Mr.
Wakefield; Mr. Edward Bytheway; Mrs. Jones; Mrs. Waterhouse; Mr.
Frier; Mr. Pope; Mr. Edward Cleeton; Mr. Turner, and Mrs.
Howard.&nbsp; The vicarial tithes are commuted for &pound;42.
3s.&nbsp; There are 27<span class="smcap">a</span>. 3<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 4<span class="smcap">p</span>. of glebe
land.&nbsp; The manor of Stottesden was the possession of Edwin,
Earl of Mercia, (at the time of Edward the Confessor), who
rebelled against that monarch, in consequence of which it was
given to Roger de Montgomery, in whose family it remained till a
failure of male heirs.&nbsp; On the 28th of Henry III., John de
Plessitis had a grant of a market here on a Tuesday, and a fair
on the eve, the day, and the day after the assumption of the
Blessed Virgin.&nbsp; There is a feast held the first Sunday
after Michaelmas day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Mary,
is an ancient edifice, built of rubble stone, having been covered
with three roofs, supported on each side of the interior by five
semicircular arches of equal size, rising from four slender
pillars, and from a pillar on each side.&nbsp; From these latter
spring two small arches, slightly pointed, and adjoining to the
rector&rsquo;s chancel; the one is connected with and opening
into the Stottesden chancel, which is still kept apart by its
ancient oak screen.&nbsp; The other semicircular arch served as
an opening to admit the staircase leading up to the ancient rood
loft, which no doubt stood under an arch between the church and
the communion chancel.&nbsp; The rood loft was swept away at the
reformation, and the arch probably about the period of the civil
wars.&nbsp; At the west end of the north and south aisles are
still to be seen the Norman pilasters, decorated with mouldings,
and carried up with the walls in the interior; probably the
oldest part of the fabric.&nbsp; The elegant part of the exterior
of this mouldering pile has been most sacrilegiously destroyed;
its parapets and battlements, with its lead roof, have entirely
disappeared.&nbsp; The north wall has been lowered, and the
windows cut through, having removed the upper or traceried part
to within five feet six inches of the surface of the
cemetery.&nbsp; The fine mullioned windows in the rectory and
Wrickton chancels, as well as on the south side of the church,
afford a beautiful display of architectural taste.&nbsp; The
eastern window of the former had twelve figures of its ancient
lords and their connections, with their armorial bearings,
including that of the sovereign of the day, and the royal arms
displayed on shields, exhibited upon their breasts: five only of
these now remain, in a very mutilated state.&nbsp; The upper or
traceried compartments are still ornamented with stained
glass.&nbsp; In the south wall is still to be seen the piscina or
sink for the reception of any impurity falling into the
elements.&nbsp; In the same wall appear the canopied seats of the
priest, deacon, and sub-deacon, in their beautifully ornamented
niches; and near to these is an ancient oilet or loophole window,
with exquisitely fine mouldings, all of which savour much of the
reign of Edward I.&nbsp; The circular stone font at the west end
is of large dimensions, well adapted for the ancient practice of
immersion; it is most elaborately carved, having a beautiful
cordage twisted with much taste around <a
name="page659"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 659</span>the verge
of the upper extremity: it is greatly ornamented, having eight
compartments, the one exhibiting the Agnus Dei, the others those
of Griffins, Cockatrices, and Centaurs, and is altogether a
beautiful and rare specimen of an inimitable chisel of its day,
probably as early as the reign of Henry III.&nbsp; The pulpit
exhibits much ancient carving, beautifully executed, and put up
with a sounding board in 1675.&nbsp; The desk, also much
ornamented with carving, was set up in 1583.&nbsp; The entrance
of the porch to the south is under a semicircular arch of great
antiquity, probably introduced from a former porch.&nbsp; This,
the principal approach into the interior of the edifice, is under
an ancient arch of the pointed style; that on the north side is
of a very early period, as well as that into the chancel.&nbsp;
This latter is singular and rare, exhibiting an unusual display
of fine chiselling.&nbsp; The entrance out of this chancel into
the vestry is under a stone arch of the florid style, executed by
a tasteful und scientific artist.&nbsp; The tower is lofty, and
standing on a commanding eminence is a beautiful land mark in the
country: the lower part to the second string course is built like
the church with rubble material, but from that course upwards,
including its battlements, is of good Ashler stone.&nbsp; It was
rebuilt in 1583, and contains a peal of five musical bells, and
clock and sun dial.&nbsp; Over the doorway leading from the tower
to the church is an ancient and curious tympanum.&nbsp; The
church was repaired in the year 1840, by which means 268
additional sittings were obtained, of which 215 are declared free
and unappropriated for ever, in consequence of grants from the
Incorporated and Hereford Diocesan Societies.&nbsp; The living is
a vicarage, to which the curacy of Farlow is annexed, valued in
the king&rsquo;s books at &pound;5. 10s. 10d., now returned at
&pound;676; in the patronage of the Duke of Cleveland, and
incumbency of the Rev. Charles John Maddison.&nbsp; <span

strongly impregnated saline water were discovered in the
immediate locality of this place.&nbsp; The water is similar to
that of Cheltenham, except that there appears to be double the
quantity of saline matter in the fluid, one pint of which, on
slow evaporation in a shallow vessel, produced an ounce of
crystalline salt.&nbsp; The analysis of one of the springs is as
follows:&mdash;Chloride of sodium 923.52 grains, of calcium
461.9, of potassum 38.63, of magnesium 41.81; sulphate of
magnesia 1.57, protoxide of iron 4.82; silica 4.54, and bromine
and iodine .84;&mdash;total, 1,476.89 grains.&nbsp; Convenient
and elegant buildings have been erected for the accommodation of
the numerous visitors who frequent the baths.&nbsp; In the
immediate vicinity of the baths are several good inns.&nbsp; The
situation is remarkably salubrious, and the scenery beautifully
picturesque and varied.&nbsp; Coaches from Ludlow to Bewdley,
Kidderminster, Dudley, and Birmingham, pass and repass twice a
day, calling at the Swan Inn and the Royal Oak Hotel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Mary,
is a handsome stone edifice with a square tower.&nbsp; It

Shropshire in 1580; on the outer part are the representations of
the apostles, and in the inner compartment are the figures of
Edmund Cornwall, his father and mother, and below a
representation of the baron in his winding sheet.&nbsp; He is
said to have been 7 feet 8 inches in height.&nbsp; The triptych
was painted in 1588, by Melchior Salaboss, better known by the
name of Gherardino Milanese.&nbsp; This very beautiful work of
art is in admirable preservation, and with two others in
different parts of the kingdom are the only triptychs in
England.&nbsp; There is a recumbent figure, beautifully carved in
oak, to the memory of the Princess Elizabeth, daughter of John of
Gaunt, and sister of Henry IV., who died and was buried at
Burford in the year 1426.&nbsp; There is also a recumbent figure
of wood to the memory of Edmundas Cornewalle.&nbsp; An ancient
tomb remembers Elizabeth Devroke, daughter of Sir Walter Devroke,
Knight, who lived to see seventeen score and more children raised
from her body, she died in 1508; besides which there are various
memorials which our limits will not allow us to notice.&nbsp; In
the chancel are two beautiful stained glass windows.&nbsp; The

commenced his travels in 1594, and for four years remained on the
continent, when he returned home a little while, and then took
his journey again into Bohemia, Polonia, and Hungary, where for
the defence of the Christian faith, he put himself under the
banner of Rodulph, the second emperor of the Romans, and was at
the siege of Stregonium, in Hungary, against the Turks.&nbsp;
Afterwards he visited most of the ancient cities of Greece, and
from thence he went to Constantinople, in the reign of Mahomet,
the third emperor of the Turks, who, to do him honour, gave him a
Turkish gown of cloth and gold; and his mother, the Sultana
Ebrita, gave him another rich gown of cloth and silver, and fifty
chequins in gold.&nbsp; After a twelvemonths sojourn there, he
returned to England; where, after staying a while, he went into
Spain, and came back in safety: and again, the fourth time, took
his journey from London to Venice, in October, 1610; from which
time he was never seen by any of his acquaintances, nor any
certainty known of his death.&nbsp; Thomas Hearne, speaking of
the descent of the family of Coningsby, informs us that an
ancient parchment is preserved by them as a precious relic, on
which is written:&mdash;</p>

modes of employment and the means of amusement, so as to excite
agreeable emotions, and to soften the unavoidable severity of
confinement.&nbsp; The establishment will accommodate 220

<h3>PRESTON MONTFORD, <span class="GutSmall">AND</span>
DINTHILL</h3>
<p>is a township in the parish of St. Alkmund, returned in 1841
as containing 17 houses and 76 inhabitants.&nbsp; Preston
Montford is situated four miles N.W. from Shrewsbury, and
consists of a few scattered houses leading to Montford
Bridge.&nbsp; Dinthill is completely severed from Montford, and
lies about three and a half miles S.W. from Shrewsbury, near the
Shrewsbury and Welshpool road.&nbsp; It is considered as a

<h3>WESTBURY</h3>
<p>is a parish and considerable village situated on the
Shrewsbury and Montgomery turnpike road, nine miles S.W. by S. of
the former place, and twelve miles N.E. of the latter.&nbsp; It
comprises the townships of Marsh district, Newton, Stretton,
Vennington, Wallop, Westbury, Westley, Whitton, Wigmore, Winsley,
and Yockleton, which have an area of 18,347 acres of land.&nbsp;
Rateable value, &pound;10,810.&nbsp; The woodlands are 197 acres,
and roads 67&frac12; acres.&nbsp; Edward William Pembroke Smithe
Owen, Esq., is lord of the manor and the principal
landowner.&nbsp; Colonel John Wingfield and John Michael Severne,
Esq., are also considerable proprietors.&nbsp; The rent charge is
&pound;1,459. 16s. 5d.&nbsp; Population in 1801, 1,991; 1831,
2,228; and in 1841 there were 314 houses and 2,412 persons.&nbsp;
Westbury, anciently written <i>Wesberie</i>, was held in the
reign of the Confessor by Ernui, and was free.&nbsp; Roger, the
son of Corbet, held of Earl Roger most of that tract of land
lying in the hundred of Ford, with parts of Chirbury and Condover
hundreds, which in the whole consisted of 39 manors or hamlets,
and for his seat he built the Castle of Cause.&nbsp; It is
thought that Roger Corbet or his son espoused the cause of his
patron, Robert de Belesme, against Henry the I., and upon
incurring the king&rsquo;s displeasure, forfeited his
inheritance, which was given to Pain Fitz John.&nbsp; In 2nd
Henry III. the king commanded the Earl of Chester to restore to
Thomas Corbet the Castle of Cause and all his lands.&nbsp; In
30th Henry III. the said Thomas Corbet had a <a
name="page685"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 685</span>grant of
free warren in Cause and two years after, the grant of a fair to
be kept on the eve, the day, and the day after, the translation
of Thomas the martyr.&nbsp; The site of the castle is lofty and
commanding; it stood on an isolated ridge, rising abruptly from a
deep ravine on one side, and sloping towards a vast valley
bounded by the Stiperstones on the other.&nbsp; The castle is in
a state of complete dilapidation.&nbsp; There is a colliery in
this township, and bricks and tiles are also made near the
village.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. Mary,
has a square tower, in which are five bells.&nbsp; The interior
is neatly pewed, and consists of nave, side aisles, and
chancel.&nbsp; There are many neat tablets in the church.&nbsp;
The living is a rectory divided into the two portions of Westbury
in Dextra and Westbury in Sinistra.&nbsp; The former portion is
rated in the king&rsquo;s book at &pound;13. 9s. 4&frac12;d., now
returned at &pound;643, and the latter at &pound;11. 12s.
8&frac12;d., is now returned at &pound;556.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>John Topp</i>,
by deed, dated 1716, left a yearly rent charge of &pound;30
issuing out of certain lands in Vennington, upon trust, to
dispose of the same yearly in the education of poor children of
the parish of Westbury, and in putting out such children
apprentices.&nbsp; <i>Letitia Barnster</i>, by indenture, dated
1726, left for the benefit of the poor of the parish a small
parcel of land fourteen yards in length and six yards eight
inches in breadth.&nbsp; On this land a school was built in 1736,
and a residence for the master has since been built upon land
belonging to E. W. P. S. Owen, Esq.</p>
<p>On the tables of benefactions in the church are noticed
charities left by twenty several donors for the benefit of the
poor, amounting to the sum of &pound;153. 13s. 4d.&nbsp; This
sum, with an additional &pound;6. 6s. 8d., was expended in the
year 1710 in the purchase of three parcels of land in the parish
of Worthen, containing about 17 acres, the rent of which amounted
to &pound;43. 10s. per annum at the time the Charity
Commissioners published their reports.&nbsp; One-fourth of these
rents are distributed in bread to the poor of the parish on Good
Friday, and the residue given away on St. Thomas&rsquo;s day in
clothing, fuel, and money, as is most advisable.</p>

Ford and Purslow.&nbsp; It is divided into the upper and lower
divisions; the former containing 1,783 inhabitants, and the

contains the parish of Chirbury, and part of Church Stoke; and
the lower division the parishes of Shelve, Worthen, and part of
Hyssington.</p>
<h3>CHIRBURY</h3>
<p>is an extensive parish and considerable village in the upper

townships of Chirbury, Dudston, Hockleton, Marrington, Marton,
Middleton, Priestweston, Rorrington, Stockton, Tunberth, Walcot,
Wilmington, Winsbury, and Wotherton, which together embrace an
area of 11,041<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 27<span class="smcap">p</span>. of
land.&nbsp; Gross estimated rental, &pound;12,648. 15s. 5d.&nbsp;
Rateable value, &pound;11,442. 12s. 6d.&nbsp; Population in 1801,
1,391; 1831, 1,576; 1841, 1,593; 1851, 1,533; at the latter
period there were 303 houses.&nbsp; The most considerable
landowners are the Earl of Powis; Sir Offley Pembury Wakeman,
Bart; George Pritchard, Esq.; Rev. R. H. M. Price; Edward
Humphries, Esq.; William Rubbathan, Esq.; and John Davies,
Esq.&nbsp; The former owns the whole township of Chirbury, which
contains 1,125<span class="smcap">a</span>. 1<span
class="smcap">r</span>. 16<span class="smcap">p</span>. of land,
the rateable value of which is &pound;1,606. 10s.&nbsp; At the
census of 1841 there were 56 houses and 278 inhabitants.&nbsp;
The village of Chirbury is pleasantly situated in a fertile
valley on the confines of Montgomeryshire, eighteen miles and a
half south-west from Shrewsbury, and two miles and a half east
from Montgomery.&nbsp; Petty Sessions are held here the first
Wednesday in each month.&nbsp; The inhabitants are chiefly
engaged in agricultural pursuits.&nbsp; Some few, however, are
employed in the lead mines and stone quarries in the immediate
vicinity.&nbsp; The village is watered by the Camlad stream,
which is noted for the excellency of its trout.&nbsp; It is
presumed that the place was at one time of more consequence than
it is at present, as it gives name to the hundred in which it is
situated, and had a castle, erected in the tenth century by
Ethelfleda, Queen of the Mercians, with a view to repel the
incursions of the Welsh.&nbsp; It is said to have been a strong
and stately structure, but no vestiges of it now remain.&nbsp;
Chirbury is celebrated as having given the title of Baron to
Edward, Lord Herbert.&nbsp; He was made Knight of the Bath at the
coronation of James I., and subsequently appointed ambassador to
Louis XIII., King of France, to mediate for the
Protestants.&nbsp; On his return he was made Lord Herbert, of
Castle Island, in Ireland, where he had a large estate.&nbsp; He
greatly assisted his majesty in council and arms, and on that
account was created a baron of England by the title of <span
class="smcap">Baron Herbert</span>, of Chirbury.&nbsp; He was
author of several publications, among which is a <a
name="page688"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 688</span>life of
Henry VIII.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Chirbury Priory</span> was
of the order of St. Bennett, and founded in the time of King
John.&nbsp; In the 9th of Edward I. the prior and convent removed
to Snede, the place of their first institution and abode; for
Chirbury it seems was represented as a situation not so
convenient for celebrating divine mysteries: the religious were
to continue the same good offices to the parishioners, and the
right of burials and christenings was reserved to the church at
Chirbury.&nbsp; This monastery had a grant of the tithes of
Montgomery Wood, and of the mill there.&nbsp; At a subsequent
period the chapel of Hyssington was given to the prior of
Chirbury.&nbsp; On the dissolution of religious houses, King
Henry VIII. granted the house, and lands on which it stood, to
Edward Hopton and his heirs forever.&nbsp; In the 13th of
Elizabeth, the rectory and parsonage of Chirbury, belonging to
the late priory, was given to augment the income of the grammar
school of Shrewsbury, where it remains at present.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St.
Michael, consists of nave, chancel and side aisles, and was
formerly a portion of the conventual church of Chirbury
priory.&nbsp; It is a commodious structure, having on each side
of the nave six pointed arches rising from circular
pillars.&nbsp; There is a fine tower at the west end, surmounted
by an open-worked battlement, and eight pinnacles.&nbsp; It
contains six musical bells, set up in 1808, and partly re-cast
from the fine deep-toned priory bell which was formerly used for
ringing the curfew.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, rated in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;9. 6s. 8d., now returned at
&pound;180.; in the patronage of the corporation of Shrewsbury:
incumbent, Rev. James Wilding, M.A.&nbsp; The tithes have been
commuted, and &pound;1000 apportioned to the Free School of
Shrewsbury.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>The Free
School</i> was founded and endowed by the Rev. Edward Lewis in
1765.&nbsp; The trust property consists of a farm at Hem, in the
county of Montgomery, comprising 38 acres of land, and producing
a yearly rental of &pound;65.&nbsp; A farm at Meadow Town, in the
parish of Worthen, consisting of 41<span class="smcap">a</span>.
3<span class="smcap">r</span>. 23<span class="smcap">p</span>.,
with suitable premises, let for &pound;35 a year.&nbsp; The
school premises consist of a school and residence for the
teacher, with a small garden attached, and the master has a
salary of &pound;20 per annum.&nbsp; After paying for repairs and
other contingencies, the residue of the rent is distributed among
ten poor widows, as directed by the donor.</p>
<p><i>Thomas Edwards</i>, of Rorrington, gave by will 20s.
yearly, to be given in bread on St. Thomas&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp;
There are two other bequests recorded on the table of
benefactions, one a sum of &pound;10, and the other a rent charge
of 20s. per annum, which have long been lost to the poor.</p>

<h3>CLUN</h3>

there are 11,882 acres subject to <a name="page708"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 708</span>tithe.&nbsp; At the census of 1841

2,119 inhabitants.&nbsp; The rent charge paid to the vicar is
&pound;802. 2s. and that to lay impropriators &pound;415.&nbsp;
In the township of Clun there are 3,075<span
class="smcap">a</span>. 2<span class="smcap">r</span>. 12<span
class="smcap">p</span>. of land, the rateable value of which is
&pound;3,505. 5s., and at the census of 1841 there were 191
houses and 913 inhabitants; population in 1811, 734; and in 1831,
930 persons.&nbsp; The principal landowner is the Earl of Powis,
who is also lord of the manor; Philip Morris, Esq., Rev.
Christopher Swainson, P. M. Matthews, Esq., Thomas Evans, Esq.,
Mr. Thomas Hamer, Mr. Charles Bright, Mr. Edward Chelmick, Mr.
John Law, and Mrs. Elizabeth Jones are also proprietors, besides
whom are a number of smaller freeholders.&nbsp; Clun takes it
name from the river Colun or Clun, which rises six miles east of
the town, and flows through it, dividing it in two parts, and
thence pursuing its course to the west.&nbsp; The town is
romantically situated on a gentle eminence surrounded by lofty
hills, and consists principally of one irregular street on the
northern bank of the river, over which is an ancient stone bridge
of five pointed arches, leading to that part of the town where
the church stands.&nbsp; The borough of Clun, now greatly
declined from its ancient station, appears from Dugdale to have
been of sufficient importance, in the age immediately succeeding
the Norman Conquest, to have conferred a title on the celebrated
family of &ldquo;Fitz-Allan.&rdquo;&nbsp; It remained in the
possession of this family till the reign of Elizabeth, when by
the marriage of Mary Fitz-Allan with Philip Howard, son of Thomas
Duke of Norfolk, the estate became vested in that family.&nbsp;
From them it passed to the Walcotts, and afterwards by purchase
to the family of its present possessor, the Earl of Powis, who is
lord of the manor, though the Duke of Norfolk still retains the
title of Baron Clun.&nbsp; The castle was built about the reign
of Stephen by William Fitz-Allan Earl of Arundel, and being
exposed to the ravages of the Welsh, it was well fortified in the
8th of King Stephen.&nbsp; In Richard the First&rsquo;s time, the
king being in the Holy Land, this castle was taken by Rees Prince
of Wales, who laid all the country around waste.&nbsp; Prince
Llewellyn in the year 1234 advanced with an army against the
town, burnt the suburbs, but could not take the castle; this
damage was fully revenged <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1264, by an entire rout of the Welsh army at the battle of
Clunne.&nbsp; Lewis says, &ldquo;Within a quarter of a mile to
the north-west of the town is a single entrenchment, said to have
been raised by Owen Glendwr, as a shelter for his troops during
their attack on the castle, and within half a mile to the south
is Walls Castle, from which it was battered.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are
informed by Leland that this castle was &ldquo;somewhat in
ruins&rdquo; in his time.&nbsp; The remains now present an
interesting and picturesque object, consisting of lofty walls,
the keep, and the banquet hall, and considerable masses of the
ruin mark out both the ancient form and extent of this once
stately pile.&nbsp; About two miles and a half to the N.E. is the
camp of Ostorious, and five miles S.E., near the confluence of
the river Clun and Teme, are the Caer or Bury Ditches, the
station of that British hero, Caractacus, and the scene of his
last effort against the Roman powers.&nbsp; The camp is of an
elliptic form, comprehending an area of three or four acres of
land, on the summit of a lofty eminence, commanding an extensive
view of the surrounding country.&nbsp; The steep acclivities of
the hill are defended by a triple entrenchment, which after the
lapse of so many centuries is still entire.</p>
<p>Clun was formerly a lordship in the Marches, and was first
incorporated by the Lords Marches, whose charter was confirmed by
Edmund Earl of Arundel in the reign of Edward II., at which time
its prescriptive right was admitted, but the charter not having
been enrolled in Chancery, and all the records of the Lords
Marches having been destroyed, its being an incorporate borough
was proved by parole evidence.&nbsp; In the sixth year of King
John, William Fitz Allan had a charter for a fair to be kept here
for three days at Martlemas, which was the 11th of November and
two days after.&nbsp; Fairs are now held on the last Friday in
January, May 11th, June 15th, September 23rd, and November 22nd,
and a market is held every Tuesday.&nbsp; The poor-law union of
Clun comprises nineteen parishes, seventeen of which are in
Shropshire, and contains a population of 10,024 persons.</p>

class="smcap">The Church</span>, dedicated to St. George, is an
ancient structure in the early style of Norman architecture, and
has evidently been of greater extent than it is at present.&nbsp;
It has a low tower of great strength with a pyramidal roof, from
the centre of which rises another tower of similar form, but of
smaller dimensions; there is a peal of six bells.&nbsp; The most
ancient part of the building is the nave, which no doubt existed
prior to the Norman Conquest.&nbsp; The arch under the tower
forming the western entrance bears a strong resemblance to the
Saxon style.&nbsp; The northern entrance is under a highly
ornamented Norman arch, on the east side of which is an arched
recess, richly cinquefoiled.&nbsp; This church was partly
destroyed in Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s time by Fleetwood, one of
his generals.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage valued in the
king&rsquo;s book at &pound;18. 10s. 5d., now &pound;680, in the
patronage of the Earl of Powis and incumbency of the Rev.
Christopher Swainson.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Primitive
Methodists</span> have a neat stone chapel at Clun, built in
1834, which will accommodate 150 persons.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Wesleyan Methodists</span> have also a chapel
here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charities</span>.&mdash;<i>Henry Earl of
Northampton</i>, by will, dated 1614, founded Clun Hospital
(dedicated to the Holy Trinity), and endowed it with tithes now
producing a revenue of &pound;1,600 per annum, for the support of
thirteen poor brethren, including a master or warden.&nbsp; The
buildings comprise a quadrangle forty yards in length and the
same in breadth, which were extended in the year 1845, by the
erection of a chapel, and a dining hall, and a house for the
warden.&nbsp; The management of the hospital is vested in the
bailiff, vicar, and churchwardens, the steward of the lordship,
the rector of Hopesay, and the warden.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Hereford is visitor of the hospital, which now consists of 18
poor brethren, who receive 10s. per week, and a warden who
receives &pound;80 per year, with a house rent free, and
firing.&nbsp; The chapel is beautified with a handsome window
ornamented with the arms of the founder, the Earl of Powis and
the Bishop of Hereford.</p>
<p><i>Sarah Like</i>, by will, 1725, left &pound;60, and directed
that the interest thereof should be expended in teaching 15 poor
children to read English.</p>
<p><i>William and Elizabeth Stirchley</i>, by indenture, dated
1730, bequeathed nine acres of land at Hopebendrid township, in
this parish, in trust, to apply the rents and profits thereof for
the benefit of the poor inhabitants of Clun, to be distributed to
them every Sunday in bread.</p>
<p><i>Francis Brown</i>, who died in 1795, left &pound;100 for
the benefit of the poor of Clun, the interest thereof to be
distributed in bread every Sunday.&nbsp; There is a sum of money
in the hands of the present vicar amounting to &pound;80, the
origin of which is unknown, but it is probable that the sums of
&pound;50 stated in the returns of 1786 to have been given by
<i>Peter Meredith</i>, and &pound;20 by <i>William Acton</i>,
form part of it.&nbsp; Interest is paid for this sum at the rate
of five per cent., and what is not required for the weekly supply
of bread, is given away in clothing.&nbsp; <i>Randle Tonna</i>,
who died in 1799, left &pound;100, and directed the interest
thereof to be distributed among twenty poor people, in such sums
as the vicar and churchwardens should appoint.</p>

Meadow, in trust, for the benefit of the poor; it now produces a
yearly rent of 25s.&nbsp; The several sums above mentioned,

donor&rsquo;s grandson up to the time of his death, in 1806, and
he requested his executor to pay 10s. a year in addition to the
5s. a year left by his grandfather.&nbsp; Since Mr.
Edwards&rsquo; death, the sum of 10s. only has been received; but

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
